The operation supports different seek types, as outlined in the Stream Record Consumption\n        overview and in the description of the Type request parameter below.\n\n        DEPRECATED. Use stream.seek\n\n        See https://www.iguazio.com/docs/latest-release/data-layer/reference/web-apis/streaming-web-api/seek/.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        container (Required) : str\n            The container on which to operate.\n        path (Required) : str\n            The path of the stream.\n        seek_type (Required) : str\n            'EARLIEST': the location of the earliest ingested record in the shard.\n            'LATEST': the location of the end of the shard.\n            'TIME': the location of the earliest ingested record in the shard beginning at the base time set in the\n                    TimestampSec and TimestampNSec request parameters. If no matching record is found (i.e., if all\n                    records in the shard arrived before the specified base time) the operation returns the location\n                    of the end of the shard.\n            'SEQUENCE': the location of the record whose sequence number matches the sequence number specified in the\n                        StartingSequenceNumber request parameter. If no match is found, the operation fails.\n        access_key (Optional) : str\n            The access key with which to authenticate. Defaults to the V3IO_ACCESS_KEY env.\n        starting_sequence_number (Optional) : int\n            Record sequence number for a sequence-number based seek operation - Type=SEQUENCE. When this parameter is\n            set, the operation returns the location of the record whose sequence number matches the parameter.\n        timestamp_sec (Optional) : int\n            The base time for a time-based seek operation (Type=TIME), as a Unix timestamp in seconds. For example,\n            1511260205 sets the search base time to 21 Nov 2017 at 10:30:05 AM UTC. The TimestampNSec request parameter\n            sets the nanoseconds unit of the seek base time.\n\n            When the TimestampSec and TimestampNSec parameters are set, the operation searches for the location of the\n            earliest ingested record in the shard (the earliest record that arrived at the platform) beginning at the\n            specified base time. If no matching record is found (i.e., if all records in the shard arrived before the\n            specified base time), return the last location in the shard.\n        timestamp_nsec (Optional) : int\n            The nanoseconds unit of the TimestampSec base-time timestamp for a time-based seek operation (Type=TIME).\n            For example, if TimestampSec is 1511260205 and TimestampNSec is 500000000, seek should search for the\n            earliest ingested record since 21 Nov 2017 at 10:30 AM and 5.5 seconds.\n\n        Return Value\n        ----------\n        A `Response` object, whose `output` is `SeekShardOutput`.\n        \"\"\"\n        path = self._ensure_path_ends_with_slash(path)\n\n        return self._transport.request(\n            container,\n            access_key or self._access_key,\n            raise_for_status,\n            transport_actions,\n            v3io.dataplane.request.encode_seek_shard,\n            locals(),\n            v3io.dataplane.output.SeekShardOutput,\n        )",
