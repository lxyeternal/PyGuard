9	redlock-py - Redis distributed locks in Python
10	
11	This python lib implements the Redis-based distributed lock manager algorithm
12	[described in this blog post](http://antirez.com/news/77).
13	
14	To create a lock manager:
15	
16	    dlm = Redlock([{"host": "localhost", "port": 6379, "db": 0}, ])
17	
18	To acquire a lock:
19	
20	    my_lock = dlm.lock("my_resource_name",1000)
21	
22	Where the resource name is an unique identifier of what you are trying to lock
23	and 1000 is the number of milliseconds for the validity time.
24	
25	The returned value is `False` if the lock was not acquired (you may try again),
26	otherwise an namedtuple representing the lock is returned, having three fields:
27	
28	* validity, an integer representing the number of milliseconds the lock will be valid.
29	* resource, the name of the locked resource as specified by the user.
30	* key, a random value which is used to safe reclaim the lock.
31	
32	To release a lock:
33	
34	    dlm.unlock(my_lock)
35	
36	It is possible to setup the number of retries (by default 3) and the retry
37	delay (by default 200 milliseconds) used to acquire the lock.
38	
39	
40	**Disclaimer**: This code implements an algorithm which is currently a proposal,
41	it was not formally analyzed. Make sure to understand how it works before using it
42	in your production environments.
