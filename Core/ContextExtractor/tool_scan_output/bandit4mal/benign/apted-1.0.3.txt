34	DESCRIPTION
35	
36	    Compute the edit distance between two trees with APTED algorithm [1,2].
37	    APTED supersedes the RTED algorithm [3].
38	    By default unit cost model is supported where each edit operation
39	    has cost 1 (in case of equal labels the cost is 0).
40	
41	    For implementing other cost models see the details on github website
42	    (https://github.com/JoaoFelipe/apted).
43	
44	    This implementation is a port from the original Java implementation
45	    also available on github (https://github.com/DatabaseGroup/apted)
