29	# Scooch
30	
31	Scooch is a recursive acronym for **S**cooch **C**onfigures **O**bject 
32	**O**riented **C**lass **H**ierarchies, and that's exactly what this package 
33	does. It is a configuration package for python codebases that simplifies the 
34	problem of configuring parameters in python code by translating YAML 
35	configuration files into object oriented class hierarchies.
36	
37	# Who needs Scooch?
38	
39	Scooch is useful for people who need an accessible interface to enable 
40	tweakability in their code. ML practitioners are a good example. They 
41	typically write code that is intended to be continuously experimented with and 
42	adjusted in response to observations from running the code. As such, it is useful 
43	to abstract these tweakable parameters from the code into a config file, providing 
44	three major benefits:
45	
46	 - The config file provides a centralized location for adjustable parameters of 
47	 interest in the code, improving iteration and workflow.
48	 - Loading, saving and adjusting the configuration of your code is separated 
49	 from the many other working variables and data structures that may exist in 
50	 code.
51	 - The configuration of any part of the code can be hashed, logged, and indexed, 
52	 to provide a record of the code configuration at any one time.
53	
54	# Why use Scooch?
55	
56	There are many other projects out there that endeavor to translate config files 
57	into parameters in python code, for example:
58	
59	 - [Gin](https://github.com/google/gin-config)
60	 - [Sacred](https://sacred.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html)
61	 - [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/)
62	
63	However, what makes Scooch different is that it not only translates config 
64	parameters into variables in your code, but into object oriented class 
65	hierarchies. This means configurations can benefit from object oriented concepts 
66	such as Inheretance, Encapsulation, Abstraction and Polymorphism.
67	
68	For more information about how to use, and why to use Scooch. Please refer to 
69	the [documentation](http://www.mattcmccallum.com/scooch/docs).
