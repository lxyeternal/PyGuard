27	
28	0.98.2
29	========================================================================
30	Several updates and fixes thanks to Al and others.
31	
32	0.98.0
33	========================================================================
34	This is an exciting time for easygui.  We continue to make good progress with refactoring as
35	well as some enhancements and bug fixes here and there.
36	
37	We would like to welcome Juanjo Corrales to the team.  He is responsible for lots of good new work
38	this release.  Of course we appreciate the work of everyone who contributed.
39	
40	NOTE: I decided in this release to change the API a bit.  Please consult the function documentation for details.
41	
42	BUG FIXES
43	---------
44	 * Made changes guessing at fixes to any IDLE problems.  Please report any problems found.
45	
46	ENHANCEMENTS
47	------------
48	 * Refactored the easygui.py file into several smaller files to improve our ability to manage the code
49	 * Added callbacks to allow for more dynamic dialogs.  See the docs for usage.
50	 * Added class access to dialogs so properties may be changed.
51	 * Improved button boxes ability to resize during window resize by converting to Tkinter grid from packer.
52	
53	KNOWN ISSUES
54	------------
55	 * (old) In the documentation, there were previous references to issues when using the IDLE IDE.  I haven't
56	   experienced those, but also didn't do anything to fix them, so they may still be there.  Please report
57	   any problems and we'll try to address them
58	
59	OTHER CHANGES
60	-------------
61	 * Centralized the Python 2 versus Python 3 "compatibility layer" into boxes/utils.py
62	
63	========================================================================
64	0.97.4
65	========================================================================
66	This is a minor bug-fix release to address python 3 import errors.
67	
68	========================================================================
69	0.97.3
70	========================================================================
71	Some more fixes especially to fix Debian distro problems.
72	
73	========================================================================
74	0.97.1 & 0.97.2 (2014-12-24)
75	========================================================================
76	Boring, embarrassing uploads to fix pypi install problems.
77	
78	========================================================================
79	0.97(2014-12-20)
80	========================================================================
81	We are happy to release version 0.97 of easygui.  The intent of this release is to address some basic
82	functionality issues as well as improve easygui in the ways people have asked.
83	
84	Robert Lugg (me) was searching for a GUI library for my python work.  I saw easygui and liked very much its
85	paradigm.  Stephen Ferg, the creator and developer of easygui, graciously allowed me to start development
86	back up.  With the help of Alexander Zawadzki, Horst Jens, and others I set a goal to release before the
87	end of 2014.
88	
89	We rely on user feedback so please bring up problems, ideas, or just say how you are using easygui.
90	
91	BUG FIXES
92	---------
93	 * sourceforge #4: easygui docs contain bad references to easygui_pydoc.html
94	 * sourceforge #6: no index.html in docs download file.  Updated to sphinx which as autolinking.
95	 * sourceforge #8: unicode issues with file*box.  Fixed all that I knew how.
96	 * sourceforge #12: Cannot Exit with 'X'.  Now X and escape either return "cancel_button", if set, or None
97	
98	ENHANCEMENTS
99	------------
100	 * Added ability to specify default_choice and cancel_choice for button widgets (See API docs)
101	 * True and False are returned instead of 1 and 0 for several boxes
102	 * Allow user to map keyboard keys to buttons by enclosing a hotkey in square braces like: "Pick [M]e", which would assign
103	   keyboard key M to that button.  Double braces hide that character, and keysyms are allowed:
104	     [[q]]Exit    Would show Exit on the button, and the button would be controlled by the q key
105	     [<F1>]Help   Would show Help on the button, and the button would be controlled by the F1 function key
106	   NOTE: We are still working on the exact syntax of these key mappings as Enter, space, and arrows are already being
107	         used.
108	 * Escape and the windows 'X' button always work in buttonboxes.  Those return None in that case.
109	 * sourceforge #9: let fileopenbox open multiple files.  Added optional argument 'multiple'
110	 * Location of dialogs on screen is preserved.  This isn't perfect yet, but now, at least, the dialogs don't
111	   always reset to their default position!
112	 * added some, but not all of the bugs/enhancements developed by Robbie Brook:
113	   http://all-you-need-is-tech.blogspot.com/2013/01/improving-easygui-for-python.html
114	
115	KNOWN ISSUES
116	------------
117	 * In the documentation, there were previous references to issues when using the IDLE IDE.  I haven't
118	   experienced those, but also didn't do anything to fix them, so they may still be there.  Please report
119	   any problems and we'll try to address them
120	 * I am fairly new to contributing to open source, so I don't understand packaging, pypi, etc.  There
121	   are likely problems as well as better ways to do things.  Again, I appreciate any help or guidance.
122	
123	Other Changes (that you likely don't care about)
124	------------------------------------------------
125	 * Restructured loading of image files to try PIL first throw error if file doesn't exiglobal_state.
126	 * Converted docs to sphinx with just a bit of docteglobal_state.  Most content was retained from the old site, so
127	   there might be some redundancies still.  Please make any suggested improvements.
128	 * Set up a GitHub repository for development: https://github.com/robertlugg/easygui

131	the "modified BSD license" (aka "revised BSD", "new BSD", "3-clause BSD").
132	This license is GPL-compatible but less restrictive than GPL.
133	
134	========================================================================
135	0.96(2010-08-29)
136	========================================================================
137	This version fixes some problems with version independence.
138	
139	BUG FIXES
140	------------------------------------------------------
141	 * A statement with Python 2.x-style exception-handling syntax raised
142	   a syntax error when running under Python 3.x.
143	   Thanks to David Williams for reporting this problem.
144	
145	 * Under some circumstances, PIL was unable to display non-gif images
146	   that it should have been able to display.
147	   The cause appears to be non-version-independent import syntax.
148	   PIL modules are now imported with a version-independent syntax.
149	   Thanks to Horst Jens for reporting this problem.
150	
151	LICENSE CHANGE
152	------------------------------------------------------
153	Starting with this version, EasyGui is licensed under what is generally known as
154	the "modified BSD license" (aka "revised BSD", "new BSD", "3-clause BSD").
155	This license is GPL-compatible but less restrictive than GPL.
156	Earlier versions were licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 2.0.

158	
159	========================================================================
160	0.95(2010-06-12)
161	========================================================================
162	
163	ENHANCEMENTS
164	------------------------------------------------------
165	 * Previous versions of EasyGui could display only .gif image files using the
166	   msgbox "image" argument. This version can now display all image-file formats
167	   supported by PIL the Python Imaging Library) if PIL is installed.
168	   If msgbox is asked to open a non-gif image file, it attempts to import
169	   PIL and to use PIL to convert the image file to a displayable format.
170	   If PIL cannot be imported (probably because PIL is not installed)
171	   EasyGui displays an error message saying that PIL must be installed in order
172	   to display the image file.
173	
174	   Note that
175	   http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/
176	   says that PIL doesn't yet support Python 3.x.
177	
178	
179	========================================================================
180	0.94(2010-06-06)
181	========================================================================
182	
183	ENHANCEMENTS
184	------------------------------------------------------
185	 * The codebox and textbox functions now return the contents of the box, rather
186	   than simply the name of the button ("Yes").  This makes it possible to use
187	   codebox and textbox as data-entry widgets.  A big "thank you!" to Dominic
188	   Comtois for requesting this feature, patiently explaining his requirement,
189	   and helping to discover the tkinter techniques to implement it.
190	
191	   NOTE THAT in theory this change breaks backward compatibility.  But because
192	   (in previous versions of EasyGui) the value returned by codebox and textbox
193	   was meaningless, no application should have been checking it.  So in actual
194	   practice, this change should not break backward compatibility.
195	
196	 * Added support for SPACEBAR to command buttons.  Now, when keyboard
197	   focus is on a command button, a press of the SPACEBAR will act like
198	   a press of the ENTER key; it will activate the command button.
199	
200	 * Added support for keyboard navigation with the arrow keys (up,down,left,right)
201	   to the fields and buttons in enterbox, multenterbox and multpasswordbox,
202	   and to the buttons in choicebox and all buttonboxes.
203	
204	 * added highlightthickness=2 to entry fields in multenterbox and
205	   multpasswordbox.  Now it is easier to tell which entry field has
206	   keyboard focus.
207	
208	
209	BUG FIXES
210	------------------------------------------------------
211	 * In EgStore, the pickle file is now opened with "rb" and "wb" rather than
212	   with "r" and "w".  This change is necessary for compatibility with Python 3+.
213	   Thanks to Marshall Mattingly for reporting this problem and providing the fix.
214	
215	 * In integerbox, the actual argument names did not match the names described
216	   in the docstring. Thanks to Daniel Zingaro of at University of Toronto for
217	   reporting this problem.
218	
219	 * In integerbox, the "argLowerBound" and "argUpperBound" arguments have been
220	   renamed to "lowerbound" and "upperbound" and the docstring has been corrected.
221	
222	   NOTE THAT THIS CHANGE TO THE ARGUMENT-NAMES BREAKS BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.
223	   If argLowerBound or argUpperBound are used, an AssertionError with an
224	   explanatory error message is raised.
225	
226	 * In choicebox, the signature to choicebox incorrectly showed choicebox as
227	   accepting a "buttons" argument.  The signature has been fixed.
228	
229	
230	========================================================================
231	0.93(2009-07-07)
232	========================================================================
233	
234	ENHANCEMENTS
235	------------------------------------------------------
236	
237	 * Added exceptionbox to display stack trace of exceptions
238	
239	 * modified names of some font-related constants to make it
240	   easier to customize them
241	
242	
243	========================================================================
244	0.92(2009-06-22)
245	========================================================================
246	
247	ENHANCEMENTS
248	------------------------------------------------------
249	
250	 * Added EgStore class to to provide basic easy-to-use persistence.
251	
252	BUG FIXES
253	------------------------------------------------------
254	
255	 * Fixed a bug that was preventing Linux users from copying text out of
256	   a textbox and a codebox.  This was not a problem for Windows users.
