17	FUTURE_INCOMPATIBILITY_WARNING_TEMPLATE = """
18	
19	This is a future version incompatibility warning from Holidays v{version}
20	to inform you about an upcoming change in our API versioning strategy that may affect your
21	project's dependencies. Starting from version 1.0 onwards, we will be following a loose form of
22	Semantic Versioning (SemVer, https://semver.org) to provide clearer communication regarding any
23	potential breaking changes.
24	
25	This means that while we strive to maintain backward compatibility, there might be occasional
26	updates that introduce breaking changes to our API. To ensure the stability of your projects,
27	we highly recommend pinning the version of our API that you rely on. You can pin your current
28	holidays v0.x dependency (e.g., holidays=={version}) or limit it (e.g., holidays<1.0) in order to
29	avoid potentially unwanted upgrade to the version 1.0 when it's released (ETA 2025Q1-Q2).
30	
31	If you have any questions or concerns regarding this change, please don't hesitate to reach out
32	to us via https://github.com/vacanza/holidays/discussions/1800.
