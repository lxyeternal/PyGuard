17	library, primarily aimed at complex network research and analysis.

19	**This package is deprecated; use the igraph package instead. This package will
20	be kept in sync with igraph until Sep 1, 2022 and it will not receive any
21	updates after Sep 1, 2022.**
22	
23	Graph plotting functionality is provided by the Cairo library, so make
24	sure you install the Python bindings of Cairo if you want to generate
25	publication-quality graph plots. You can try either `pycairo
26	<http://cairographics.org/pycairo>`_ or `cairocffi <http://cairocffi.readthedocs.io>`_,
27	``cairocffi`` is recommended because there were bug reports affecting igraph
28	graph plots in Jupyter notebooks when using ``pycairo`` (but not with
29	``cairocffi``).
