10	LONG_DESCRIPTION = """
11	Metar is a python package for interpreting METAR and SPECI weather reports.
12	
13	METAR is an international format for reporting weather observations.
14	The standard specification for the METAR and SPECI codes is given
15	in the WMO Manual on Codes, vol I.1, Part A (WMO-306 I.i.A).  US
16	conventions for METAR/SPECI reports are described in chapter 12 of
17	the Federal Meteorological Handbook No.1. (FMC-H1-2017), issued by
18	NOAA.  See http://www.ofcm.gov/publications/fmh/FMH1/FMH1.pdf
19	
20	This module extracts the data recorded in the main-body groups of
21	reports that follow the WMO spec or the US conventions, except for
22	the runway state and trend groups, which are parsed but ignored.
23	The most useful remark groups defined in the US spec are parsed,
24	as well, such as the cumulative precipitation, min/max temperature,
25	peak wind and sea-level pressure groups.  No other regional conventions
26	are formally supported, but a large number of variant formats found
27	in international reports are accepted."""
