26	_DETAILED_HELP_TEXT = ("""
27	<B>OVERVIEW</B>
28	  Access Control Lists (ACLs) allow you to control who can read and write
29	  your data, and who can read and write the ACLs themselves.
30	
31	  If not specified at the time an object is uploaded (e.g., via the gsutil cp
32	  -a option), objects will be created with a default object ACL set on the
33	  bucket (see "gsutil help defacl"). You can replace the ACL on an object
34	  or bucket using the "gsutil acl set" command, or
35	  modify the existing ACL using the "gsutil acl ch" command (see "gsutil help
36	  acl").
37	
38	
39	<B>BUCKET VS OBJECT ACLS</B>
40	  In Google Cloud Storage, the bucket ACL works as follows:
41	
42	  - Users granted READ access are allowed to list the bucket contents and read
43	    bucket metadata other than its ACL.
44	
45	  - Users granted WRITE access are allowed READ access and also are allowed to
46	    write and delete objects in that bucket, including overwriting previously
47	    written objects.
48	
49	  - Users granted OWNER access are allowed WRITE access and also are allowed to
50	    read and write the bucket's ACL.
51	
52	  The object ACL works as follows:
53	
54	  - Users granted READ access are allowed to read the object's data and
55	    metadata.
56	
57	  - Users granted OWNER access are allowed READ access and also are allowed to
58	    read and write the object's ACL.
59	
60	  A couple of points are worth noting, that sometimes surprise users:
61	
62	  1. There is no WRITE access for objects; attempting to set an ACL with WRITE
63	     permission for an object will result in an error.
64	
65	  2. The bucket ACL plays no role in determining who can read objects; only the
66	     object ACL matters for that purpose. This is different from how things
67	     work in Linux file systems, where both the file and directory permission
68	     control file read access. It also means, for example, that someone with
69	     OWNER over the bucket may not have read access to objects in the bucket.
70	     This is by design, and supports useful cases. For example, you might want
71	     to set up bucket ownership so that a small group of administrators have
72	     OWNER on the bucket (with the ability to delete data to control storage
73	     costs), but not grant those users read access to the object data (which
74	     might be sensitive data that should only be accessed by a different
75	     specific group of users).
76	
77	
78	<B>ACCESSING PUBLIC OBJECTS</B>
79	  Objects with public READ access can be accessed anonymously by gsutil, via
80	  a browser, or via Cloud Storage APIs. For more details on accessing public
81	  objects, see:
82	
83	    https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-public-data
84	
85	
86	<B>CANNED ACLS</B>
87	  The simplest way to set an ACL on a bucket or object is using a "canned
88	  ACL". The available canned ACLs are:
89	
90	  project-private
91	    Gives permission to the project team based on their roles. Anyone who is
92	    part of the team has READ permission, and project owners and project editors
93	    have OWNER permission. This is the default ACL for newly created
94	    buckets. This is also the default ACL for newly created objects unless the
95	    default object ACL for that bucket has been changed. For more details see
96	    "gsutil help projects".
97	
98	  private
99	    Gives the requester (and only the requester) OWNER permission for a
100	    bucket or object.
101	
102	  public-read
103	    Gives all users (whether logged in or anonymous) READ permission. When
104	    you apply this to an object, anyone on the Internet can read the object
105	    without authenticating.
106	
107	    NOTE: By default, publicly readable objects are served with a Cache-Control
108	    header allowing such objects to be cached for 3600 seconds. If you need to
109	    ensure that updates become visible immediately, you should set a
110	    Cache-Control header of "Cache-Control:private, max-age=0, no-transform" on
111	    such objects. For help doing this, see 'gsutil help setmeta'.
112	
113	    NOTE: Setting a bucket ACL to public-read will remove all OWNER and WRITE
114	    permissions from everyone except the project owner group. Setting an object
115	    ACL to public-read will remove all OWNER and WRITE permissions from
116	    everyone except the object owner. For this reason, we recommend using
117	    the "acl ch" command to make these changes; see "gsutil help acl ch" for
118	    details.
119	
120	  public-read-write
121	    Gives all users READ and WRITE permission. This ACL applies only to buckets.
122	    NOTE: Setting a bucket to public-read-write will allow anyone on the
123	    Internet to upload anything to your bucket. You will be responsible for this
124	    content.
125	
126	    NOTE: Setting a bucket ACL to public-read-write will remove all OWNER
127	    permissions from everyone except the project owner group. Setting an object
128	    ACL to public-read-write will remove all OWNER permissions from
129	    everyone except the object owner. For this reason, we recommend using
130	    the "acl ch" command to make these changes; see "gsutil help acl ch" for
131	    details.
132	
133	  authenticated-read
134	    Gives the requester OWNER permission and gives all authenticated
135	    Google account holders READ permission.
136	
137	  bucket-owner-read
138	    Gives the requester OWNER permission and gives the bucket owner READ
139	    permission. This is used only with objects.
140	
141	  bucket-owner-full-control
142	    Gives the requester OWNER permission and gives the bucket owner
143	    OWNER permission. This is used only with objects.
144	
145	
146	<B>ACL JSON</B>
147	  When you use a canned ACL, it is translated into an JSON representation
148	  that can later be retrieved and edited to specify more fine-grained
149	  detail about who can read and write buckets and objects. By running
150	  the "gsutil acl get" command you can retrieve the ACL JSON, and edit it to
151	  customize the permissions.
152	
153	  As an example, if you create an object in a bucket that has no default
154	  object ACL set and then retrieve the ACL on the object, it will look
155	  something like this:
156	
157	  [
158	    {
159	      "entity": "group-00b4903a9740e42c29800f53bd5a9a62a2f96eb3f64a4313a115df3f3a776bf7",
160	      "entityId": "00b4903a9740e42c29800f53bd5a9a62a2f96eb3f64a4313a115df3f3a776bf7",
161	      "role": "OWNER"
162	    },
163	    {
164	      "entity": "group-00b4903a977fd817e9da167bc81306489181a110456bb635f466d71cf90a0d51",
165	      "entityId": "00b4903a977fd817e9da167bc81306489181a110456bb635f466d71cf90a0d51",
166	      "role": "OWNER"
167	    },
168	    {
169	      "entity": "00b4903a974898cc8fc309f2f2835308ba3d3df1b889d3fc7e33e187d52d8e71",
170	      "entityId": "00b4903a974898cc8fc309f2f2835308ba3d3df1b889d3fc7e33e187d52d8e71",
171	      "role": "READER"
172	    }
173	  ]
174	
175	  The ACL consists collection of elements, each of which specifies an Entity
176	  and a Role.  Entities are the way you specify an individual or group of
177	  individuals, and Roles specify what access they're permitted.
178	
179	  This particular ACL grants OWNER to two groups (which means members
180	  of those groups are allowed to read the object and read and write the ACL),
181	  and READ permission to a third group. The project groups are (in order)
182	  the project owners group, editors group, and viewers group.
183	
184	  The 64 digit hex identifiers (following any prefixes like "group-") used in
185	  this ACL are called canonical IDs.  They are used to identify predefined
186	  groups associated with the project that owns the bucket: the Project Owners,
187	  Project Editors, and All Project Team Members groups. For more information
188	  the permissions and roles of these project groups, see "gsutil help projects".
189	
190	  Here's an example of an ACL specified using the group-by-email and
191	  group-by-domain entities:
192	
193	[
194	  {
195	    "entity": "group-travel-companion-owners@googlegroups.com"
196	    "email": "travel-companion-owners@googlegroups.com",
197	    "role": "OWNER",
198	  }
199	  {
200	    "domain": "example.com",
201	    "entity": "domain-example.com"
202	    "role": "READER",
203	  },
204	]
205	
206	  This ACL grants members of an email group OWNER, and grants READ
207	  access to any user in a domain (which must be a Google Apps for Business
208	  domain). By applying email group grants to a collection of objects
209	  you can edit access control for large numbers of objects at once via
210	  http://groups.google.com. That way, for example, you can easily and quickly
211	  change access to a group of company objects when employees join and leave
212	  your company (i.e., without having to individually change ACLs across
213	  potentially millions of objects).

25	<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
26	  gsutil supports separate options for the top-level gsutil command and
27	  the individual sub-commands (like cp, rm, etc.) The top-level options
28	  control behavior of gsutil that apply across commands. For example, in
29	  the command:
30	
31	    gsutil -m cp -p file gs://bucket/obj
32	
33	  the -m option applies to gsutil, while the -p option applies to the cp
34	  sub-command.

53	              Note that you need to quote the headers/values that
54	              contain spaces (such as "Content-Disposition: attachment;
55	              filename=filename.ext"), to avoid having the shell split them
56	              into separate arguments.
57	
58	              The following headers are stored as object metadata and used
59	              in future requests on the object:
60	
61	                Cache-Control
62	                Content-Disposition
63	                Content-Encoding
64	                Content-Language
65	                Content-Type
66	
67	              The following headers are used to check data integrity:
68	
69	                Content-MD5
70	
71	              gsutil also supports custom metadata headers with a matching
72	              Cloud Storage Provider prefix, such as:
73	
74	                x-goog-meta-
75	
76	              Note that for gs:// URLs, the Cache Control header is specific to
77	              the API being used. The XML API accepts any cache control headers
78	              and returns them during object downloads.  The JSON API respects
79	              only the public, private, no-cache, max-age, and no-transform
80	              cache control headers.
81	
82	              See "gsutil help setmeta" for the ability to set metadata
83	              fields on objects after they have been uploaded.
84	
85	  -i          Allows you to use the configured credentials to impersonate a
86	              service account, for example:
87	
88	                gsutil -i "service-account@google.com" ls gs://pub
89	
90	              Note that this setting will be ignored by the XML API and S3. See
91	              'gsutil help creds' for more information on impersonating service
92	              accounts.
93	
94	  -m          Causes supported operations (acl ch, acl set, cp, mv, rm, rsync,
95	              and setmeta) to run in parallel. This can significantly improve
96	              performance if you are performing operations on a large number of
97	              files over a reasonably fast network connection.
98	
99	              gsutil performs the specified operation using a combination of
100	              multi-threading and multi-processing. The number of threads
101	              and processors are determined by ``parallel_thread_count`` and
102	              ``parallel_process_count``, respectively. These values are set in
103	              the .boto configuration file or specified in individual requests
104	              with the ``-o`` top-level flag. Because gsutil has no built-in
105	              support for throttling requests, you should experiment with these
106	              values. The optimal values can vary based on a number of factors,
107	              including network speed, number of CPUs, and available memory.
108	
109	              Using the -m option can consume a significant amount of network
110	              bandwidth and cause problems or make your performance worse if
111	              you use a slower network. For example, if you start a large rsync
112	              operation over a network link that's also used by a number of
113	              other important jobs, there could be degraded performance in
114	              those jobs. Similarly, the -m option can make your performance
115	              worse, especially for cases that perform all operations locally,
116	              because it can "thrash" your local disk.
117	
118	              To prevent such issues, reduce the values for
119	              ``parallel_thread_count`` and ``parallel_process_count``, or stop
120	              using the -m option entirely. One tool that you can use to limit
121	              how much I/O capacity gsutil consumes and prevent it from
122	              monopolizing your local disk is `ionice
123	              <http://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix_commands/ionice.htm>`_
124	              (built in to many Linux systems). For example, the following
125	              command reduces the I/O priority of gsutil so it doesn't
126	              monopolize your local disk:
127	
128	                ionice -c 2 -n 7 gsutil -m rsync -r ./dir gs://some bucket
129	
130	              If a download or upload operation using parallel transfer fails
131	              before the entire transfer is complete (e.g. failing after 300 of
132	              1000 files have been transferred), you must restart the entire
133	              transfer.
134	
135	              Also, although most commands normally fail upon encountering an
136	              error when the -m flag is disabled, all commands continue to try
137	              all operations when -m is enabled with multiple threads or
138	              processes, and the number of failed operations (if any) are
139	              reported as an exception at the end of the command's execution.
140	
141	  -o          Override values in the `boto configuration file
142	              <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/boto-gsutil>`_ for the
143	              current command, in the format ``<section>:<name>=<value>``. For
144	              example, ``gsutil -o "GSUtil:parallel_thread_count=4" ...``. This
145	              does not pass the option to gsutil integration tests and does not
146	              change the values that are saved in the boto configuration file.
147	
148	  -q          Causes gsutil to perform operations quietly, i.e., without
149	              reporting progress indicators of files being copied or removed,
150	              etc. Errors are still reported. This option can be useful for
151	              running gsutil from a cron job that logs its output to a file, for
152	              which the only information desired in the log is failures.
153	
154	  -u          Allows you to specify the ID or number of a user project to be
155	              billed for the request. For example:
156	
157	                gsutil -u "bill-this-project" cp ...

24	_DETAILED_HELP_TEXT = ("""
25	<B>OVERVIEW</B>
26	  Google Cloud Storage provides a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) header that
27	  allows clients to verify the integrity of object contents. For non-composite
28	  objects Google Cloud Storage also provides an MD5 header to allow clients to
29	  verify object integrity, but for composite objects only the CRC is available.
30	  gsutil automatically performs integrity checks on all uploads and downloads.
31	  Additionally, you can use the ``gsutil hash`` command to calculate a CRC for
32	  any local file.
33	
34	  The CRC variant used by Google Cloud Storage is called CRC32C (Castagnoli),
35	  which is not available in the standard Python distribution. The implementation
36	  of CRC32C used by gsutil is provided by a third-party Python module called
37	  `crcmod <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/crcmod>`_.
38	
39	  The crcmod module contains a pure-Python implementation of CRC32C, but using
40	  it results in slow checksum computation and subsequently very poor
41	  performance. A Python C extension is also provided by crcmod, which requires
42	  compiling into a binary module for use. gsutil ships with a precompiled
43	  crcmod C extension for macOS; for other platforms, see the installation
44	  instructions below.
45	
46	  At the end of each copy operation, the ``gsutil cp``, ``gsutil mv``, and
47	  ``gsutil rsync`` commands validate that the checksum of the source
48	  file/object matches the checksum of the destination file/object. If the
49	  checksums do not match, gsutil will delete the invalid copy and print a
50	  warning message. This very rarely happens, but if it does, you should
51	  retry the operation.
52	
53	
54	<B>CONFIGURATION</B>
55	  To determine if the compiled version of crcmod is available in your Python
56	  environment, you can inspect the output of the ``gsutil version`` command for
57	  the "compiled crcmod" entry:
58	
59	    $ gsutil version -l
60	    ...
61	    compiled crcmod: True
62	    ...
63	
64	  If your crcmod library is compiled to a native binary, this value will be
65	  True. If using the pure-Python version, the value will be False.
66	
67	  To control gsutil's behavior in response to crcmod's status, you can set the
68	  ``check_hashes`` variable in your `boto configuration file
69	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/boto-gsutil>`_. For details on this
70	  variable, see the surrounding comments in your boto configuration file. If
71	  ``check_hashes`` is not present in your configuration file, regenerate the
72	  file by running ``gsutil config`` with the appropriate ``-e`` or ``-a`` flag.
73	
74	
75	<B>INSTALLATION</B>
76	  These installation instructions assume that:
77	
78	  -  You have ``pip`` installed. Consult the `pip installation instructions
79	     <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_ for details on how
80	     to install ``pip``.
81	  -  Your installation of ``pip`` can be found in your ``PATH`` environment
82	     variable. If it cannot, you may need to replace ``pip3`` in the commands
83	     below with the full path to the executable.
84	  -  You are installing the crcmod package for use with your system installation
85	     of Python, and thus use the ``sudo`` command. If installing crcmod for a
86	     different Python environment (e.g. in a virtualenv), you should omit
87	     ``sudo`` from the commands below.
88	  -  You are using a Python 3 version with gsutil. You can determine which
89	     Python version gsutil is using by running ``gsutil version -l`` and looking
90	     for the ``python version: 2.x.x`` or ``python version: 3.x.x`` line.
91	
92	  CentOS, RHEL, and Fedora
93	  ------------------------
94	
95	  To compile and install crcmod:
96	
97	    yum install gcc python3-devel python3-setuptools redhat-rpm-config
98	    sudo pip3 uninstall crcmod
99	    sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod
100	
101	  Debian and Ubuntu
102	  -----------------
103	
104	  To compile and install crcmod:
105	
106	    sudo apt-get install gcc python3-dev python3-setuptools
107	    sudo pip3 uninstall crcmod
108	    sudo pip3 install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod
109	
110	  Enterprise SUSE
111	  -----------------
112	
113	  To compile and install crcmod when using Enterprise SUSE for SAP 12:
114	
115	    sudo zypper install gcc python-devel
116	    sudo pip uninstall crcmod
117	    sudo pip install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod
118	    
119	  To compile and install crcmod when using Enterprise SUSE for SAP 15:
120	
121	    sudo zypper install gcc python3-devel
122	    sudo pip uninstall crcmod
123	    sudo pip install --no-cache-dir -U crcmod
124	
125	  macOS
126	  -----
127	
128	  gsutil distributes a pre-compiled version of crcmod for macOS, so you shouldn't
129	  need to compile and install it yourself. If for some reason the pre-compiled
130	  version is not being detected, please let the Google Cloud Storage team know
131	  (see ``gsutil help support``).
132	
133	  To compile manually on macOS, you will first need to install
134	  `Xcode <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>`_ and then run:
135	
136	    pip3 install -U crcmod
137	
138	  Windows
139	  -------
140	
141	  An installer is available for the compiled version of crcmod from the Python
142	  Package Index (PyPi) at the following URL:
143	
144	  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/crcmod/1.7
145	
146	  NOTE: If you have installed crcmod and gsutil hasn't detected it, it may have
147	  been installed to the wrong directory. It should be located at
148	  <python_dir>\\files\\Lib\\site-packages\\crcmod\\
149	
150	  In some cases the installer will incorrectly install to
151	  <python_dir>\\Lib\\site-packages\\crcmod\\
152	
153	  Manually copying the crcmod directory to the correct location should resolve
154	  the issue.

24	_DETAILED_HELP_TEXT = ("""
25	<B>OVERVIEW</B>
26	  gsutil currently supports several types of credentials/authentication, as
27	  well as the ability to `access public data anonymously
28	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-public-data>`_. Each of these
29	  type of credentials is discussed in more detail below, along with
30	  information about configuring and using credentials via the Cloud SDK.
31	
32	
33	<B>Configuring/Using Credentials via Cloud SDK Distribution of gsutil</B>
34	  When gsutil is installed/used via the Cloud SDK ("gcloud"), credentials are
35	  stored by Cloud SDK in a non-user-editable file located under
36	  ~/.config/gcloud (any manipulation of credentials should be done via the
37	  gcloud auth command). If you need to set up multiple credentials (e.g., one
38	  for an individual user account and a second for a service account), the
39	  gcloud auth command manages the credentials for you, and you switch between
40	  credentials using the gcloud auth command as well (for more details, see
41	  https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/auth).
42	
43	  Once credentials have been configured via ``gcloud auth``, those credentials
44	  are used regardless of whether the user has any boto configuration files
45	  (which are located at ~/.boto unless a different path is specified in the
46	  BOTO_CONFIG environment variable). However, gsutil still looks for credentials
47	  in the boto config file if a type of non-GCS credential is needed that's not
48	  stored in the gcloud credential store (e.g., an HMAC credential for an S3
49	  account).
50	
51	
52	<B>SUPPORTED CREDENTIAL TYPES</B>
53	  gsutil supports several types of credentials (the specific subset depends on
54	  which distribution of gsutil you are using; see above discussion).
55	
56	  OAuth2 user account:
57	    This type of credential can be used for authenticating requests on behalf of
58	    a specific user (which is probably the most common use of gsutil). This is
59	    the default type of credential that is created when you run ``gcloud init``.
60	    This credential type is not supported for stand-alone versions of gsutil.
61	    For more details about OAuth2 authentication, see:
62	    https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2#scenarios
63	
64	  HMAC:
65	    This type of credential can be used by programs that are implemented using
66	    HMAC authentication, which is an authentication mechanism supported by
67	    certain other cloud storage service providers. This type of credential can
68	    also be used for interactive use when moving data to/from service providers
69	    that support HMAC credentials. This is the type of credential that is
70	    created when you run ``gsutil config -a``.
71	
72	    Note that it's possible to set up HMAC credentials for both Google Cloud
73	    Storage and another service provider; or to set up OAuth2 user account
74	    credentials for Google Cloud Storage and HMAC credentials for another
75	    service provider. To do so, after you run the ``gcloud init`` command, you
76	    can edit the generated ~/.boto config file and look for comments for where
77	    other credentials can be added.
78	
79	    For more details about HMAC authentication, see `HMAC keys for Cloud Storage
80	    <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/hmackeys>`_.
81	
82	  OAuth2 service account:
83	    This is a credential you can use when authenticating on
84	    behalf of a service or application (as opposed to a user). For example, if
85	    you intend to run gsutil out of a nightly cron job to upload/download data,
86	    using a service account means the cron job does not depend on credentials of
87	    an individual employee at your company. This is the type of credential that
88	    is configured when you run ``gcloud auth  login`` with the ``--cred-file``
89	    flag (or ``gsutil config -e`` when using stand-alone versions of gsutil).
90	
91	    You should generally avoid this credential type because it requires storing
92	    highly-privileged credentials in your local environment, creating potential
93	    security risks. Instead, service account impersonation or workload identity
94	    federation are the recommended alternatives when authenticating on behalf of
95	    a service or application.
96	
97	    It is important to note that a service account is considered an Editor by
98	    default for the purposes of API access, rather than an Owner. In particular,
99	    the fact that Editors have OWNER access in the default object and
100	    bucket ACLs, but the predefined ACL options remove OWNER access from
101	    Editors, can lead to unexpected results. The solution to this problem is to
102	    use "gsutil acl ch" instead of "gsutil acl set <predefined-ACL>" to change
103	    permissions on a bucket.
104	
105	    To set up a service account for use with gsutil, see
106	    `Authorize a service account using a service account key
107	    <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#key>`_.
108	    
109	    For more details about OAuth2 service accounts, see
110	    `Using OAuth 2.0 for server to server applications
111	    <https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/service-account>`_.
112	
113	  Compute Engine internal service account:
114	    This is the type of service account used for accounts hosted by App Engine
115	    or Compute Engine. Such credentials are created automatically for
116	    you on Compute Engine when you run the ``gcloud compute instances create``
117	    command and the credentials can be controlled with the ``--scopes`` flag.
118	
119	    For more details about using service account credentials for authenticating workloads
120	    on Compute Engine, see
121	    https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/create-enable-service-accounts-for-instances.
122	
123	    For more details about App Engine service accounts, see
124	    https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/appidentity/overview
125	
126	  Service account impersonation:
127	    Impersonating a service account is useful in scenarios where you need to
128	    grant short-term access to specific resources. For example, if you have a
129	    bucket of sensitive data that is typically read-only and want to
130	    temporarily grant write access through a trusted service account.
131	
132	    You can specify which service account to use for impersonation by running
133	    ``gsutil -i``, ``gsutil config -e`` and editing the boto configuration file, or
134	    ``gcloud config set auth/impersonate_service_account [service_account_email_address]``.
135	
136	    In order to impersonate, your original credentials need to be granted
137	    roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator on the target service account.
138	    For more information see
139	    https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/use-service-account-impersonation.
140	
141	  External account credentials (workload identity federation):
142	    Using workload identity federation, you can access Google Cloud resources
143	    from Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure or any identity provider
144	    that supports OpenID Connect (OIDC) or SAML 2.0.
145	
146	    For more information see
147	    https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation.

39	       (https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate)
40	
41	     Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
42	     instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll
43	     add you to the official list of contributors and be able to accept
44	     your patches.
45	
46	  2. If you found a bug or have an idea for a feature enhancement, we suggest
47	     you check https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil/issues to see if it
48	     has already been reported by another user. From there you can also
49	     subscribe to updates to the issue.
50	
51	     If a GitHub issue doesn't already exist, create one about your idea before
52	     sending actual code. Often we can discuss the idea and help propose things
53	     that could save you later revision work.
54	
55	  3. We tend to avoid adding command line options that are of use to only
56	     a very small fraction of users, especially if there's some other way
57	     to accommodate such needs. Adding such options complicates the code and
58	     also adds overhead to users having to read through an "alphabet soup"
59	     list of option documentation.
60	
61	  4. While gsutil has a number of features specific to Google Cloud Storage,
62	     it can also be used with other cloud storage providers. We're open to
63	     including changes for making gsutil support features specific to other
64	     providers, as long as those changes don't make gsutil work worse for Google
65	     Cloud Storage. If you do make such changes we recommend including someone
66	     with knowledge of the specific provider as a code reviewer (see below).
67	
68	  5. You can check out the gsutil code from the GitHub repository:
69	
70	       https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil
71	
72	     To clone a read-only copy of the repository:
73	
74	       git clone git://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil.git
75	
76	     To push your own changes to GitHub, click the Fork button on the
77	     repository page and clone the repository from your own fork.
78	
79	  6. The gsutil git repository uses git submodules to pull in external modules.
80	     After checking out the repository, make sure to also pull the submodules
81	     by entering into the gsutil top-level directory and run:
82	
83	       git submodule update --init --recursive
84	
85	  7. Please make sure to run all tests against your modified code. To
86	     do this, change directories into the gsutil top-level directory and run:
87	
88	       ./gsutil test
89	
90	     The above tests take a long time to run because they send many requests to
91	     the production service. The gsutil test command has a -u argument that will
92	     only run unit tests. These run quickly, as they are executed with an
93	     in-memory mock storage service implementation. To run only the unit tests,
94	     run:
95	
96	       ./gsutil test -u
97	
98	     If you made changes to boto, please run the boto tests. For these tests you
99	     need to use HMAC credentials (from gsutil config -a), because the boto test
100	     suite doesn't import the OAuth2 handler. You'll also need to install some
101	     Python modules. Change directories into the boto root directory at
102	     third_party/boto and run:
103	
104	       pip install -r requirements.txt
105	
106	     (You probably need to run this command using sudo.)
107	     Make sure each of the individual installations succeeded. If they don't
108	     you may need to run the install command again.
109	
110	     Then ensure your .boto file has HMAC credentials defined, and then change
111	     directories into boto's tests directory and run:
112	
113	       python test.py unit
114	       python test.py -t s3 -t gs -t ssl
115	
116	  8. Please consider contributing test code for your change, especially if the
117	     change impacts any of the core gsutil code (like the gsutil cp command).
118	
119	  9. Please run the yapf linter with the config files in the root of the GitHub
120	     repository:
121	
122	       yapf -irp .
123	
124	  10. When it's time to send us code, please submit a PR to the `gsutil GitHub
125	      repository <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil>`_. For help on
126	      making GitHub PRs, please refer to this

24	_DETAILED_HELP_TEXT = ("""
25	<B>OVERVIEW</B>
26	  To reduce the chance for `filename encoding interoperability problems
27	  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename#Encoding_indication_interoperability>`_
28	  gsutil uses `UTF-8 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8>`_ character encoding
29	  when uploading and downloading files. Because UTF-8 is in widespread (and
30	  growing) use, for most users nothing needs to be done to use UTF-8. Users with
31	  files stored in other encodings (such as
32	  `Latin 1 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859-1>`_) must convert those
33	  filenames to UTF-8 before attempting to upload the files.
34	
35	  The most common place where users who have filenames that use some other
36	  encoding encounter a gsutil error is while uploading files using the recursive
37	  (-R) option on the gsutil cp , mv, or rsync commands. When this happens you'll
38	  get an error like this:
39	
40	      CommandException: Invalid Unicode path encountered
41	      ('dir1/dir2/file_name_with_\\xf6n_bad_chars').
42	      gsutil cannot proceed with such files present.
43	      Please remove or rename this file and try again.
44	
45	  Note that the invalid Unicode characters have been hex-encoded in this error
46	  message because otherwise trying to print them would result in another
47	  error.
48	
49	  If you encounter such an error you can either remove the problematic file(s)
50	  or try to rename them and re-run the command. If you have a modest number of
51	  such files the simplest thing to do is to think of a different name for the
52	  file and manually rename the file (using local filesystem tools). If you have
53	  too many files for that to be practical, you can use a bulk rename tool or
54	  script.
55	
56	  Unicode errors for valid Unicode filepaths can be caused by lack of Python
57	  locale configuration on Linux and Mac OSes. If your file paths are Unicode
58	  and you get encoding errors, ensure the LANG environment variable is set
59	  correctly. Typically, the LANG variable should be set to something like
60	  "en_US.UTF-8" or "de_DE.UTF-8".
61	
62	  Note also that there's no restriction on the character encoding used in file
63	  content - it can be UTF-8, a different encoding, or non-character
64	  data (like audio or video content). The gsutil UTF-8 character encoding
65	  requirement applies only to filenames.
66	
67	
68	<B>USING UNICODE FILENAMES ON WINDOWS</B>
69	  Windows support for Unicode in the command shell (cmd.exe or powershell) is
70	  somewhat painful, because Windows uses a Windows-specific character encoding
71	  called `cp1252 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252>`_. To use Unicode
72	  characters you need to run this command in the command shell before the first
73	  time you use gsutil in that shell:
74	
75	    chcp 65001
76	
77	  If you neglect to do this before using gsutil, the progress messages while
78	  uploading files with Unicode names or listing buckets with Unicode object
79	  names will look garbled (i.e., with different glyphs than you expect in the
80	  output). If you simply run the chcp command and re-run the gsutil command, the
81	  output should no longer look garbled.
82	
83	  gsutil attempts to translate between cp1252 encoding and UTF-8 in the main
84	  places that Unicode encoding/decoding problems have been encountered to date
85	  (traversing the local file system while uploading files, and printing Unicode
86	  names while listing buckets). However, because gsutil must perform
87	  translation, it is likely there are other erroneous edge cases when using
88	  Windows with Unicode. If you encounter problems, you might consider instead
89	  using cygwin (on Windows) or Linux or macOS - all of which support Unicode.
90	
91	
92	<B>USING UNICODE FILENAMES ON MACOS</B>
93	  macOS stores filenames in decomposed form (also known as
94	  `NFD normalization <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence>`_).
95	  For example, if a filename contains an accented "e" character, that character
96	  will be converted to an "e" followed by an accent before being saved to the
97	  filesystem. As a consequence, it's possible to have different name strings
98	  for files uploaded from an operating system that doesn't enforce decomposed
99	  form (like Ubuntu) from one that does (like macOS).
100	
101	  The following example shows how this behavior could lead to unexpected
102	  results. Say you create a file with non-ASCII characters on Ubuntu. Ubuntu
103	  stores that filename in its composed form. When you upload the file to the
104	  cloud, it is stored as named. But if you use gsutil rysnc to bring the file to
105	  a macOS machine and edit the file, then when you use gsutil rsync to bring
106	  this version back to the cloud, you end up with two different objects, instead
107	  of replacing the original. This is because macOS converted the filename to
108	  a decomposed form, and Cloud Storage sees this as a different object name.
109	
110	
111	<B>CROSS-PLATFORM ENCODING PROBLEMS OF WHICH TO BE AWARE</B>
112	  Using UTF-8 for all object names and filenames will ensure that gsutil doesn't
113	  encounter character encoding errors while operating on the files.
114	  Unfortunately, it's still possible that files uploaded / downloaded this way
115	  can have interoperability problems, for a number of reasons unrelated to
116	  gsutil. For example:
117	
118	  - Windows filenames are case-insensitive, while Google Cloud Storage, Linux,
119	    and macOS are not. Thus, for example, if you have two filenames on Linux
120	    differing only in case and upload both to Google Cloud Storage and then
121	    subsequently download them to Windows, you will end up with just one file
122	    whose contents came from the last of these files to be written to the
123	    filesystem.
124	  - macOS performs character encoding decomposition based on tables stored in
125	    the OS, and the tables change between Unicode versions. Thus the encoding
126	    used by an external library may not match that performed by the OS. It is
127	    possible that two object names may translate to a single local filename.
128	  - Windows console support for Unicode is difficult to use correctly.
129	
130	  For a more thorough list of such issues see `this presentation
131	  <http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/filename-issues-iuc33.pdf>`_
132	
133	  These problems mostly arise when sharing data across platforms (e.g.,
134	  uploading data from a Windows machine to Google Cloud Storage, and then
135	  downloading from Google Cloud Storage to a machine running macOS).
136	  Unfortunately these problems are a consequence of the lack of a filename
137	  encoding standard, and users need to be aware of the kinds of problems that
138	  can arise when copying filenames across platforms.
139	
140	  There is one precaution users can exercise to prevent some of these problems:
141	  When using the Windows console specify wildcards or folders (using the -R
142	  option) rather than explicitly named individual files.
143	
144	
145	<B>CONVERTING FILENAMES TO UNICODE</B>
146	  Open-source tools are available to convert filenames for non-Unicode files.
147	  For example, to convert from latin1 (a common Windows encoding) to Unicode,
148	  you can use
149	  `Windows iconv <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/libiconv.htm>`_.
150	  For Unix-based systems, you can use
151	  `libiconv <https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>`_.

25	<B>OVERVIEW OF METADATA</B>
26	  Objects can have associated metadata, which control aspects of how
27	  GET requests are handled, including ``Content-Type``, ``Cache-Control``,
28	  ``Content-Disposition``, and ``Content-Encoding``. In addition, you can
29	  set custom ``key:value`` metadata for use by your applications. For a
30	  discussion of specific metadata properties, see the `metadata concept
31	  page <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/metadata>`_.
32	
33	  There are two ways to set metadata on objects:
34	
35	  - At upload time you can specify one or more metadata properties to
36	    associate with objects, using the ``gsutil -h option``.  For example,
37	    the following command would cause gsutil to set the ``Content-Type`` and
38	    ``Cache-Control`` for each of the files being uploaded from a local
39	    directory named ``images``:
40	
41	      gsutil -h "Content-Type:text/html" \\
42	             -h "Cache-Control:public, max-age=3600" cp -r images \\
43	             gs://bucket/images
44	
45	    Note that -h is an option on the gsutil command, not the cp sub-command.
46	
47	  - You can set or remove metadata fields from already uploaded objects using
48	    the ``gsutil setmeta`` command. See "gsutil help setmeta".
49	
50	<B>SETTABLE FIELDS; FIELD VALUES</B>
51	  You can't set some metadata fields, such as ETag and Content-Length. The
52	  fields you can set are:
53	
54	  - ``Cache-Control``
55	  - ``Content-Disposition``
56	  - ``Content-Encoding``
57	  - ``Content-Language``
58	  - ``Content-Type``
59	  - ``Custom-Time``
60	  - Custom metadata
61	
62	  Field names are case-insensitive.
63	
64	  All fields and their values must consist only of ASCII characters, with the
65	  exception of values for ``x-goog-meta-`` fields, which may contain arbitrary
66	  Unicode values. Note that when setting metadata using the XML API, which sends
67	  custom metadata as HTTP headers, Unicode characters are encoded using
68	  UTF-8, then url-encoded to ASCII. For example:
69	
70	    gsutil setmeta -h "x-goog-meta-foo: ã" gs://bucket/object
71	
72	  stores the custom metadata key-value pair of ``foo`` and ``%C3%A3``.
73	  Subsequently, running ``ls -L`` using the JSON API to list the object's
74	  metadata prints ``%C3%A3``, while ``ls -L`` using the XML API
75	  url-decodes this value automatically, printing the character ``ã``.
76	
77	
78	<B>VIEWING CURRENTLY SET METADATA</B>
79	  You can see what metadata is currently set on an object by using:
80	
81	    gsutil ls -L gs://the_bucket/the_object

25	<B>BUCKET NAME REQUIREMENTS</B>
26	  Google Cloud Storage has a single namespace, so you will not be allowed
27	  to create a bucket with a name already in use by another user. You can,
28	  however, carve out parts of the bucket name space corresponding to your
29	  company's domain name (see "DOMAIN NAMED BUCKETS").
30	
31	  Bucket names must conform to standard DNS naming conventions. This is
32	  because a bucket name can appear in a DNS record as part of a CNAME
33	  redirect. In addition to meeting DNS naming requirements, Google Cloud
34	  Storage imposes other requirements on bucket naming. At a minimum, your
35	  bucket names must meet the following requirements:
36	
37	  - Bucket names must contain only lowercase letters, numbers, dashes (-), and
38	    dots (.).
39	
40	  - Bucket names must start and end with a number or letter.
41	
42	  - Bucket names must contain 3 to 63 characters. Names containing dots can
43	    contain up to 222 characters, but each dot-separated component can be
44	    no longer than 63 characters.
45	
46	  - Bucket names cannot be represented as an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal
47	    notation (for example, 192.168.5.4).
48	
49	  - Bucket names cannot begin with the "goog" prefix.
50	
51	  - For DNS compliance, you should not have a period adjacent to another
52	    period or dash. For example, ".." or "-." or ".-" are not acceptable.
53	
54	
55	<B>OBJECT NAME REQUIREMENTS</B>
56	  Object names can contain any sequence of Unicode characters, of length 1-1024
57	  bytes when UTF-8 encoded. Object names must not contain CarriageReturn,
58	  CarriageReturnLineFeed, or the XML-disallowed surrogate blocks (xFFFE
59	  or xFFFF).
60	
61	  We strongly recommend that you abide by the following object naming
62	  conventions:
63	
64	  - Avoid using control characters that are illegal in XML 1.0 in your object
65	    names (#x7F-#x84 and #x86-#x9F). These characters will cause XML listing
66	    issues when you try to list your objects.
67	
68	  - Avoid using "#" in your object names. gsutil interprets object names ending
69	    with #<numeric string> as version identifiers, so including "#" in object
70	    names can make it difficult or impossible to perform various operations on
71	    such objects using gsutil (see 'gsutil help versions').
72	
73	  - Avoid using "[", "]", "*", or "?" in your object names. gsutil interprets
74	    these characters as wildcards, so including any of these characters in
75	    object names can make it difficult or impossible to perform various wildcard
76	    operations using gsutil (see 'gsutil help wildcards').
77	
78	  See also 'gsutil help encoding' about file/object name encoding requirements
79	  and potential interoperability concerns.
80	
81	
82	<B>DOMAIN NAMED BUCKETS</B>
83	  You can carve out parts of the Google Cloud Storage bucket name space
84	  by creating buckets with domain names (like "example.com").
85	
86	  Before you can create a bucket name containing one or more '.' characters,
87	  the following rules apply:
88	
89	  - If the name is a syntactically valid DNS name ending with a
90	    currently-recognized top-level domain (such as .com), you will be required
91	    to verify domain ownership.
92	  - Otherwise you will be disallowed from creating the bucket.
93	
94	  If your project needs to use a domain-named bucket, you need to have
95	  a team member both verify the domain and create the bucket. This is
96	  because Google Cloud Storage checks for domain ownership against the
97	  user who creates the bucket, so the user who creates the bucket must
98	  also be verified as an owner or manager of the domain.
99	
100	  To verify as the owner or manager of a domain, use the Google Webmaster
101	  Tools verification process. The Webmaster Tools verification process
102	  provides three methods for verifying an owner or manager of a domain:
103	
104	  1. Adding a special Meta tag to a site's homepage.
105	  2. Uploading a special HTML file to a site.
106	  3. Adding a DNS TXT record to a domain's DNS configuration.
107	
108	  Meta tag verification and HTML file verification are easier to perform and
109	  are probably adequate for most situations. DNS TXT record verification is
110	  a domain-based verification method that is useful in situations where a
111	  site wants to tightly control who can create domain-named buckets. Once
112	  a site creates a DNS TXT record to verify ownership of a domain, it takes
113	  precedence over meta tag and HTML file verification. For example, you might
114	  have two IT staff members who are responsible for managing your site, called
115	  "example.com." If they complete the DNS TXT record verification, only they
116	  would be able to create buckets called "example.com", "reports.example.com",
117	  "downloads.example.com", and other domain-named buckets.
118	
119	  Site-Based Verification
120	  -----------------------
121	
122	  If you have administrative control over the HTML files that make up a site,
123	  you can use one of the site-based verification methods to verify that you
124	  control or own a site. When you do this, Google Cloud Storage lets you
125	  create buckets representing the verified site and any sub-sites - provided
126	  nobody has used the DNS TXT record method to verify domain ownership of a
127	  parent of the site.
128	
129	  As an example, assume that nobody has used the DNS TXT record method to verify
130	  ownership of the following domains: abc.def.example.com, def.example.com,
131	  and example.com. In this case, Google Cloud Storage lets you create a bucket
132	  named abc.def.example.com if you verify that you own or control any of the
133	  following sites:
134	
135	    http://abc.def.example.com
136	    http://def.example.com
137	    http://example.com
138	
139	  Domain-Based Verification
140	  -------------------------
141	
142	  If you have administrative control over a domain's DNS configuration, you can
143	  use the DNS TXT record verification method to verify that you own or control a
144	  domain. When you use the domain-based verification method to verify that you
145	  own or control a domain, Google Cloud Storage lets you create buckets that
146	  represent any subdomain under the verified domain. Furthermore, Google Cloud
147	  Storage prevents anybody else from creating buckets under that domain unless
148	  you add their name to the list of verified domain owners or they have verified
149	  their domain ownership by using the DNS TXT record verification method.
150	
151	  For example, if you use the DNS TXT record verification method to verify your
152	  ownership of the domain example.com, Google Cloud Storage will let you create
153	  bucket names that represent any subdomain under the example.com domain, such
154	  as abc.def.example.com, example.com/music/jazz, or abc.example.com/music/jazz.
155	
156	  Using the DNS TXT record method to verify domain ownership supersedes
157	  verification by site-based verification methods. For example, if you
158	  use the Meta tag method or HTML file method to verify domain ownership
159	  of http://example.com, but someone else uses the DNS TXT record method
160	  to verify ownership of the example.com domain, Google Cloud Storage will
161	  not allow you to create a bucket named example.com. To create the bucket
162	  example.com, the domain owner who used the DNS TXT method to verify domain
163	  ownership must add you to the list of verified domain owners for example.com.
164	
165	  The DNS TXT record verification method is particularly useful if you manage
166	  a domain for a large organization that has numerous subdomains because it
167	  lets you control who can create buckets representing those domain names.
168	
169	  Note: If you use the DNS TXT record verification method to verify ownership of
170	  a domain, you cannot create a CNAME record for that domain. RFC 1034 disallows
171	  inclusion of any other resource records if there is a CNAME resource record
172	  present. If you want to create a CNAME resource record for a domain, you must
173	  use the Meta tag verification method or the HTML file verification method.

26	<B>OVERVIEW</B>
27	  If you use gsutil in large production tasks (such as uploading or
28	  downloading many GiBs of data each night), there are a number of things
29	  you can do to help ensure success. Specifically, this section discusses
30	  how to script large production tasks around gsutil's resumable transfer
31	  mechanism.
32	
33	
34	<B>BACKGROUND ON RESUMABLE TRANSFERS</B>
35	  First, it's helpful to understand gsutil's resumable transfer mechanism,
36	  and how your script needs to be implemented around this mechanism to work
37	  reliably. gsutil uses resumable transfer support when you attempt to download
38	  a file of any size or to upload a file larger than a configurable threshold
39	  (by default, this threshold is %d MiB). If a transfer fails partway through
40	  (e.g., because of an intermittent network problem), gsutil uses a
41	  `truncated randomized binary exponential backoff-and-retry strategy
42	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/retry-strategy#tools>`_ that by
43	  default retries transfers up to 23 times over a 10 minute period of time. If
44	  the transfer fails each of these attempts with no intervening progress,
45	  gsutil gives up on the transfer, but keeps a "tracker" file for it in a
46	  configurable location (the default location is ~/.gsutil/, in a file named
47	  by a combination of the SHA1 hash of the name of the bucket and object being
48	  transferred and the last 16 characters of the file name). When transfers
49	  fail in this fashion, you can rerun gsutil at some later time (e.g., after
50	  the networking problem has been resolved), and the resumable transfer picks
51	  up where it left off.
52	
53	
54	<B>SCRIPTING DATA TRANSFER TASKS</B>
55	  To script large production data transfer tasks around this mechanism,
56	  you can implement a script that runs periodically, determines which file
57	  transfers have not yet succeeded, and runs gsutil to copy them. Below,
58	  we offer a number of suggestions about how this type of scripting should
59	  be implemented:
60	
61	  1. When resumable transfers fail without any progress 23 times in a row
62	     over the course of up to 10 minutes, it probably won't work to simply
63	     retry the transfer immediately. A more successful strategy would be to
64	     have a cron job that runs every 30 minutes, determines which transfers
65	     need to be run, and runs them. If the network experiences intermittent
66	     problems, the script picks up where it left off and will eventually
67	     succeed (once the network problem has been resolved).
68	
69	  2. If your business depends on timely data transfer, you should consider
70	     implementing some network monitoring. For example, you can implement
71	     a task that attempts a small download every few minutes and raises an
72	     alert if the attempt fails for several attempts in a row (or more or less
73	     frequently depending on your requirements), so that your IT staff can
74	     investigate problems promptly. As usual with monitoring implementations,
75	     you should experiment with the alerting thresholds, to avoid false
76	     positive alerts that cause your staff to begin ignoring the alerts.
77	
78	  3. There are a variety of ways you can determine what files remain to be
79	     transferred. We recommend that you avoid attempting to get a complete
80	     listing of a bucket containing many objects (e.g., tens of thousands
81	     or more). One strategy is to structure your object names in a way that
82	     represents your transfer process, and use gsutil prefix wildcards to
83	     request partial bucket listings. For example, if your periodic process
84	     involves downloading the current day's objects, you could name objects
85	     using a year-month-day-object-ID format and then find today's objects by
86	     using a command like gsutil ls "gs://bucket/2011-09-27-*". Note that it
87	     is more efficient to have a non-wildcard prefix like this than to use
88	     something like gsutil ls "gs://bucket/*-2011-09-27". The latter command
89	     actually requests a complete bucket listing and then filters in gsutil,
90	     while the former asks Google Storage to return the subset of objects
91	     whose names start with everything up to the "*".
92	
93	     For data uploads, another technique would be to move local files from a "to
94	     be processed" area to a "done" area as your script successfully copies
95	     files to the cloud. You can do this in parallel batches by using a command
96	     like:
97	
98	       gsutil -m cp -r to_upload/subdir_$i gs://bucket/subdir_$i
99	
100	     where i is a shell loop variable. Make sure to check the shell $status
101	     variable is 0 after each gsutil cp command, to detect if some of the copies
102	     failed, and rerun the affected copies.
103	
104	     With this strategy, the file system keeps track of all remaining work to
105	     be done.
106	
107	  4. If you have really large numbers of objects in a single bucket
108	     (say hundreds of thousands or more), you should consider tracking your
109	     objects in a database instead of using bucket listings to enumerate
110	     the objects. For example this database could track the state of your
111	     downloads, so you can determine what objects need to be downloaded by
112	     your periodic download script by querying the database locally instead
113	     of performing a bucket listing.
114	
115	  5. Make sure you don't delete partially downloaded temporary files after a
116	     transfer fails: gsutil picks up where it left off (and performs a hash
117	     of the final downloaded content to ensure data integrity), so deleting
118	     partially transferred files will cause you to lose progress and make
119	     more wasteful use of your network.
120	
121	  6. If you have a fast network connection, you can speed up the transfer of
122	     large numbers of files by using the gsutil -m (multi-threading /
123	     multi-processing) option. Be aware, however, that gsutil doesn't attempt to
124	     keep track of which files were downloaded successfully in cases where some
125	     files failed to download. For example, if you use multi-threaded transfers
126	     to download 100 files and 3 failed to download, it is up to your scripting
127	     process to determine which transfers didn't succeed, and retry them. A
128	     periodic check-and-run approach like outlined earlier would handle this
129	     case.
130	
131	     If you use parallel transfers (gsutil -m) you might want to experiment with
132	     the number of threads being used (via the parallel_thread_count setting
133	     in the .boto config file). By default, gsutil uses 10 threads for Linux
134	     and 24 threads for other operating systems. Depending on your network
135	     speed, available memory, CPU load, and other conditions, this may or may
136	     not be optimal. Try experimenting with higher or lower numbers of threads
137	     to find the best number of threads for your environment.

24	_DETAILED_HELP_TEXT = ("""
25	<B>OVERVIEW</B>
26	  This help section provides details about various precautions taken by gsutil
27	  to protect data security, as well as recommendations for how customers should
28	  safeguard security.
29	
30	
31	<B>TRANSPORT LAYER SECURITY</B>
32	  gsutil performs all operations using transport-layer encryption (HTTPS), to
33	  protect against data leakage over shared network links. This is also important
34	  because gsutil uses "bearer tokens" for authentication (OAuth2) as well as for
35	  resumable upload identifiers, and such tokens must be protected from being
36	  eavesdropped and reused.
37	
38	  gsutil also supports the older HMAC style of authentication via the XML API
39	  (see `gsutil endpoints
40	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#gsutil>`_).  While
41	  HMAC authentication does not use bearer tokens (and thus is not subject to
42	  eavesdropping/replay attacks), it's still important to encrypt data traffic.
43	  
44	  To add an extra layer of security, gsutil supports mutual TLS (mTLS) for
45	  the Cloud Storage JSON API. With mTLS, the client verifies the server
46	  certificate, and the server also verifies the client.
47	  To find out more about how to enable mTLS, see the `install docs
48	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil_install>`_.
49	
50	
51	<B>LOCAL FILE STORAGE SECURITY</B>
52	  gsutil takes a number of precautions to protect against security exploits in
53	  the files it stores locally:
54	
55	  - When the ``gcloud init``, ``gsutil config -a``, or ``gsutil config -e``
56	    commands run, they set file protection mode 600 ("-rw-------") on the .boto
57	    configuration file they generate, so only the user (or superuser) can read
58	    it. This is important because these files contain security-sensitive
59	    information, including credentials and proxy configuration.
60	
61	  - These commands also use file protection mode 600 for the private key file
62	    stored locally when you create service account credentials.
63	
64	  - The default level of logging output from gsutil commands does not include
65	    security-sensitive information, such as OAuth2 tokens and proxy
66	    configuration information. (See the "RECOMMENDED USER PRECAUTIONS" section
67	    below if you increase the level of debug output, using the gsutil -D
68	    option.)
69	
70	  Note that protection modes are not supported on Windows, so if you
71	  use gsutil on Windows we recommend using an encrypted file system and strong
72	  account passwords.
73	
74	
75	<B>SECURITY-SENSITIVE FILES WRITTEN TEMPORARILY TO DISK BY GSUTIL</B>
76	  gsutil buffers data in temporary files in several situations:
77	
78	  - While compressing data being uploaded via gsutil cp -z/-Z, gsutil
79	    buffers the data in temporary files with protection 600, which it
80	    deletes after the upload is complete (similarly for downloading files
81	    that were uploaded with gsutil cp -z/-Z or some other process that sets the
82	    Content-Encoding to "gzip"). However, if you kill the gsutil process
83	    while the upload is under way the partially written file will be left
84	    in place. See the "CHANGING TEMP DIRECTORIES" section in
85	    "gsutil help cp" for details of where the temporary files are written
86	    and how to change the temp directory location.
87	
88	  - When performing a resumable upload gsutil stores the upload ID (which,
89	    as noted above, is a bearer token and thus should be safe-guarded) in a
90	    file under ~/.gsutil/tracker-files with protection 600, and deletes this
91	    file after the upload is complete. However, if the upload doesn't
92	    complete successfully the tracker file is left in place so the resumable
93	    upload can be re-attempted later. Over time it's possible to accumulate
94	    these tracker files from aborted upload attempts, though resumable
95	    upload IDs are only valid for 1 week, so the security risk only exists
96	    for files less than that age. If you consider the risk of leaving
97	    aborted upload IDs in the tracker directory too high you could modify
98	    your upload scripts to delete the tracker files; or you could create a
99	    cron job to clear the tracker directory periodically.
100	
101	  - The gsutil rsync command stores temporary files (with protection 600)
102	    containing the names, sizes, and checksums of source and destination
103	    directories/buckets, which it deletes after the rsync is complete.
104	    However, if you kill the gsutil process while the rsync is under way the
105	    listing files will be left in place.
106	
107	  Note that gsutil deletes temporary files using the standard OS unlink system
108	  call, which does not perform `data wiping
109	  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_erasure>`_. Thus, the content of such
110	  temporary files can be recovered by a determined adversary.
111	
112	
113	<B>ACCESS CONTROL LISTS</B>
114	  Unless you specify a different ACL (e.g., via the gsutil cp -a option), by
115	  default objects written to a bucket use the default object ACL on that bucket.
116	  Unless you modify that ACL (e.g., via the gsutil defacl command), by default
117	  it will allow all project editors write access to the object and read/write
118	  access to the object's metadata and will allow all project viewers read
119	  access to the object.
120	
121	  The Google Cloud Storage access control system includes the ability to
122	  specify that objects are publicly readable. Make sure you intend for any
123	  objects you write with this permission to be public. Once "published", data
124	  on the Internet can be copied to many places, so it's effectively impossible
125	  to regain read control over an object written with this permission.
126	
127	  The Google Cloud Storage access control system includes the ability to
128	  specify that buckets are publicly writable. While configuring a bucket this
129	  way can be convenient for various purposes, we recommend against using this
130	  permission - it can be abused for distributing illegal content, viruses, and
131	  other malware, and the bucket owner is legally and financially responsible
132	  for the content stored in their buckets. If you need to make content
133	  available to customers who don't have Google accounts consider instead using
134	  signed URLs (see "gsutil help signurl").
135	
136	
137	<B>SOFTWARE INTEGRITY AND UPDATES</B>
138	  gsutil is distributed as a part of the bundled Cloud SDK release. This
139	  distribution method takes a variety of security precautions to protect the
140	  integrity of the software. We strongly recommend against getting a copy of
141	  gsutil from any other sources (such as mirror sites).
142	
143	
144	<B>PROXY USAGE</B>
145	  gsutil supports access via proxies, such as Squid and a number of commercial
146	  products. A full description of their capabilities is beyond the scope of this
147	  documentation, but proxies can be configured to support many security-related
148	  functions, including virus scanning, Data Leakage Prevention, control over
149	  which certificates/CA's are trusted, content type filtering, and many more
150	  capabilities. Some of these features can slow or block legitimate gsutil
151	  behavior. For example, virus scanning depends on decrypting file content,
152	  which in turn requires that the proxy terminate the gsutil connection and
153	  establish a new connection - and in some cases proxies will rewrite content in
154	  ways that result in checksum validation errors and other problems.
155	
156	  For details on configuring proxies, see the proxy help text generated in your
157	  .boto configuration file by the ``gcloud init``, ``gsutil -a``, and
158	  ``gsutil -e`` commands.
159	
160	
161	<B>ENCRYPTION AT REST</B>
162	  All Google Cloud Storage data are automatically stored in an encrypted state,
163	  but you can also provide your own encryption keys. For more information, see
164	  `Cloud Storage Encryption
165	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption>`_.
166	
167	<B>DATA PRIVACY</B>
168	  Google will never ask you to share your credentials, password, or other
169	  security-sensitive information. Beware of potential phishing scams where
170	  someone attempts to impersonate Google and asks for such information.
171	
172	
173	<B>MEASUREMENT DATA</B>
174	  The gsutil perfdiag command collects a variety of performance-related
175	  measurements and details about your local system and network environment, for
176	  use in troubleshooting performance problems. None of this information will be
177	  sent to Google unless you choose to send it.
178	
179	
180	<B>RECOMMENDED USER PRECAUTIONS</B>
181	  The first and foremost precaution is: Never share your credentials. Each user
182	  should have distinct credentials.
183	
184	  If you run gsutil -D (to generate debugging output) it will include OAuth2
185	  refresh and access tokens in the output. Make sure to redact this information
186	  before sending this debug output to anyone during troubleshooting/tech support
187	  interactions.
188	
189	  If you run gsutil --trace-token (to send a trace directly to Google),
190	  sensitive information like OAuth2 tokens and the contents of any files
191	  accessed during the trace may be included in the content of the trace.
192	
193	  Customer-supplied encryption key information in the .boto configuration is
194	  security sensitive.
195	
196	  The proxy configuration information in the .boto configuration is
197	  security-sensitive, especially if your proxy setup requires user and
198	  password information. Even if your proxy setup doesn't require user and
199	  password, the host and port number for your proxy is often considered
200	  security-sensitive. Protect access to your .boto configuration file.
201	
202	  If you are using gsutil from a production environment (e.g., via a cron job
203	  running on a host in your data center), use service account credentials rather
204	  than individual user account credentials. These credentials were designed for
205	  such use and, for example, protect you from losing access when an employee
206	  leaves your company.

25	<B>OVERVIEW</B>
26	  Cloud SDK includes a new CLI, gcloud storage, that can be considerably faster
27	  than gsutil when performing uploads and downloads with less parameter
28	  tweaking. This new CLI has a syntax and command structure that is familiar to
29	  gsutil users but is fundamentally different in many important ways. To ease
30	  transition to this new CLI, gsutil provides a shim that translates your gsutil
31	  commands to gcloud storage commands if an equivalent exists, and falls back to
32	  gsutil's usual behavior if an equivalent does not exist.
33	                       
34	<B> PREREQUISITES </B>
35	                       
36	You should be running gsutil binary installed via Cloud SDK tool.
37	To verify this, run ``gsutil ver -l`` and you should be able to see
38	``pass cloud sdk credentials to gsutil: True``. If it is ``False``,
39	try running ``gcloud config set pass_credentials_to_gsutil True``.
40	If you do not have ``gcloud`` installed, follow the
41	`Cloud SDK installation instructions. <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install>`_.
42	
43	
44	<B>TO ENABLE</B>
45	  Set ``use_gcloud_storage=True`` in the ``.boto`` config file under the
46	  ``[GSUtil]`` section:
47	
48	    [GSUtil]
49	    use_gcloud_storage=True
50	
51	  You can also set the flag for individual commands using the top-level ``-o``
52	  flag:
53	
54	    gsutil -o "GSUtil:use_gcloud_storage=True" -m cp -p file gs://bucket/obj
55	
56	<B>AVAILABLE COMMANDS</B>
57	  The gcloud storage CLI only supports a subset of gsutil commands. What follows
58	  is a list of commands supported by the shim with any differences in behavior
59	  noted.
60	
61	  acl

84	  - Works as expected.
85	
86	  cors
87	  ------------------------
88	
89	  - ``get`` subcommand prints "[]" instead of "gs://[bucket name] has no CORS
90	    configuration".

92	  cp
93	  ------------------------
94	
95	  - Copies a second object even if the first object is invalid.
96	  - Does not support file to file copies.
97	  - Supports copying objects cloud-to-cloud with trailing slashes in the name.
98	  - The all-version flag (``-A``) silently enables sequential execution rather
99	    than raising an error.
100	
101	  defacl
102	  ------------------------
103	
104	  - The ``ch`` subcommand is not supported.
105

107	  ------------------------
108	
109	  - Works as expected.
110	
111	  hash
112	  ------------------------
113	
114	  - In gsutil, the ``-m`` and ``-c`` flags that affect which hashes are displayed

141	  - Works as expected.
142	
143	  logging
144	  ------------------------
145	
146	  - The get subcommand has different JSON spacing and doesn't print an
147	    informational message if no configuration is found.
148	
149	  ls
150	  ------------------------
151	
152	  - `ls -L` output uses spaces instead of tabs.

274	<B>GENERAL COMPATIBILITY NOTES</B>
275	
276	  - Due to its compatibility across all major platforms, multiprocessing is
277	    enabled for all commands by default (equivalent to the -m option always
278	    being included in gsutil).
279	  - A sequence of asterisks greater than 2 (i.e. ``***``) are always treated as
280	    a single asterisk.
281	  - Unlike gsutil, gcloud is not designed to be used in parallel invocations,
282	    and doing so (i.e. running the shim from 2 terminals at once) can lead to
283	    unpredictable behavior.
284	  - Assuming a bucket contains an object ``gs://bucket/nested/foo.txt``,
285	    gsutil's wildcard iterator will match ``foo.txt`` given a URL like
286	    ``gs://bucket/*/nested/*``. The shim will not match ``foo.txt`` given the
287	    same URL.
288	  - This will be updated as new commands are supported by both gcloud storage
289	    and the shim.
290	  - If Unicode is having issues, try setting the environment variable
291	    ``PYTHONUTF8`` to ``1``. Specifically, this may help on the Windows
292	    command-line (CMD).

25	<B>TECHNICAL SUPPORT</B>
26	  If you have any questions or encounter any problems with Google Cloud Storage,
27	  please first read the `FAQ <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/faq>`_.
28	
29	  If you still have questions please use one of the following methods as
30	  appropriate, providing the details noted below:
31	
32	  A) For API, tool usage, or other software development-related questions,
33	  please search for and post questions on Stack Overflow, using the official
34	  `google-cloud-storage tag
35	  <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-cloud-storage>`_. Our
36	  support team actively monitors questions to this tag and we'll do our best to
37	  respond.
38	
39	  B) For gsutil bugs or feature requests, please check if there is already a
40	  `existing GitHub issue <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil/issues>`_
41	  that covers your request. If not, create a
42	  `new GitHub issue <https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gsutil/issues/new>`_.
43	
44	  To help us diagnose any issues you encounter, when creating a new issue
45	  please provide these details in addition to the description of your problem:
46	
47	  - The resource you are attempting to access (bucket name, object name),
48	    assuming they are not sensitive.
49	  - The operation you attempted (GET, PUT, etc.)
50	  - The time and date (including timezone) at which you encountered the problem
51	  - If you can use gsutil to reproduce your issue, specify the -D option to
52	    display your request's HTTP details, and provide these details in the 
53	    issue.
54	
55	  Warning: The gsutil -d, -D, and -DD options will also print the authentication
56	  header with authentication credentials for your Google Cloud Storage account.
57	  Make sure to remove any "Authorization:" headers before you post HTTP details
58	  to the issue. Note also that if you upload files large enough to use resumable
59	  uploads, the resumable upload IDs are security-sensitive while an upload
60	  is not yet complete, so should not be posted on public forums.
61	
62	  If you make any local modifications to gsutil, please make sure to use
63	  a released copy of gsutil (instead of your locally modified copy) when
64	  providing the gsutil -D output noted above. We cannot support versions
65	  of gsutil that include local modifications. (However, we're open to user
66	  contributions; see "gsutil help dev".)

25	<B>OVERVIEW</B>
26	  Versioning-enabled buckets maintain noncurrent versions of objects, providing
27	  a way to un-delete data that you accidentally deleted, or to retrieve older
28	  versions of your data. Noncurrent objects are ignored by gsutil commands
29	  unless you indicate it should do otherwise by setting a relevant command flag
30	  or by including a specific generation number in your command. For example,
31	  wildcards like ``*`` and ``**`` do not, by themselves, act on noncurrent
32	  object versions.
33	  
34	  When using gsutil cp, you cannot specify a version-specific URL as the
35	  destination, because writes to Cloud Storage always create a new version.
36	  Trying to specify a version-specific URL as the destination of ``gsutil cp``
37	  results in an error. When you specify a noncurrent object as a source in a
38	  copy command, you always create a new object version and retain the original
39	  (even when using the command to restore a live version). You can use the 
40	  ``gsutil mv`` command to simultaneously restore an object version and remove
41	  the noncurrent copy that was used as the source.
42	
43	  You can turn versioning on or off for a bucket at any time. Turning
44	  versioning off leaves existing object versions in place and simply causes
45	  the bucket to delete the existing live version of the object whenever a new
46	  version is uploaded.
47	
48	  Regardless of whether you have enabled versioning on a bucket, every object
49	  has two associated positive integer fields:
50	
51	  - the generation, which is updated when a new object replaces an existing
52	    object with the same name. Note that there is no guarantee that generation
53	    numbers increase for successive versions, only that each new version has a
54	    unique generation number.
55	  - the metageneration, which identifies the metadata generation. It starts
56	    at 1; is updated every time the metadata (e.g., ACL or Content-Type) for a
57	    given content generation is updated; and gets reset when the generation
58	    number changes.
59	
60	  Of these two integers, only the generation is used when working with versioned
61	  data. Both generation and metageneration can be used with concurrency control.
62	  
63	  To learn more about versioning and concurrency, see the following documentation:
64	  
65	  - `Overview of Object Versioning
66	    <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-versioning>`_
67	  - `Guide for using Object Versioning
68	    <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-object-versioning>`_

74	_SET_DESCRIPTION = """
75	<B>SET</B>
76	  The ``acl set`` command allows you to set an Access Control List on one or
77	  more buckets and objects. As part of the command, you must specify either a
78	  predefined ACL or the path to a file that contains ACL text. The simplest way
79	  to use the ``acl set`` command is to specify one of the predefined ACLs,
80	  e.g.,:
81	
82	    gsutil acl set private gs://example-bucket/example-object
83	
84	  If you want to make an object or bucket publicly readable or writable, it is
85	  recommended to use ``acl ch``, to avoid accidentally removing OWNER
86	  permissions. See the ``acl ch`` section for details.
87	
88	  See `Predefined ACLs
89	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists#predefined-acl>`_
90	  for a list of predefined ACLs.
91	
92	  If you want to define more fine-grained control over your data, you can
93	  retrieve an ACL using the ``acl get`` command, save the output to a file, edit
94	  the file, and then use the ``acl set`` command to set that ACL on the buckets
95	  and/or objects. For example:
96	
97	    gsutil acl get gs://bucket/file.txt > acl.txt
98	
99	  Make changes to acl.txt such as adding an additional grant, then:
100	
101	    gsutil acl set acl.txt gs://cats/file.txt
102	
103	  Note that you can set an ACL on multiple buckets or objects at once. For
104	  example, to set ACLs on all .jpg files found in a bucket:
105	
106	    gsutil acl set acl.txt gs://bucket/**.jpg
107	
108	  If you have a large number of ACLs to update you might want to use the
109	  gsutil -m option, to perform a parallel (multi-threaded/multi-processing)
110	  update:
111	
112	    gsutil -m acl set acl.txt gs://bucket/**.jpg
113	
114	  Note that multi-threading/multi-processing is only done when the named URLs
115	  refer to objects, which happens either if you name specific objects or
116	  if you enumerate objects by using an object wildcard or specifying
117	  the acl -r flag.
118	
119	
120	<B>SET OPTIONS</B>
121	  The "set" sub-command has the following options
122	
123	  -R, -r      Performs "acl set" request recursively, to all objects under
124	              the specified URL.
125	
126	  -a          Performs "acl set" request on all object versions.
127	
128	  -f          Normally gsutil stops at the first error. The -f option causes
129	              it to continue when it encounters errors. If some of the ACLs
130	              couldn't be set, gsutil's exit status will be non-zero even if
131	              this flag is set. This option is implicitly set when running
132	              "gsutil -m acl...".

135	_CH_DESCRIPTION = """
136	<B>CH</B>
137	  The "acl ch" (or "acl change") command updates access control lists, similar
138	  in spirit to the Linux chmod command. You can specify multiple access grant
139	  additions and deletions in a single command run; all changes will be made
140	  atomically to each object in turn. For example, if the command requests
141	  deleting one grant and adding a different grant, the ACLs being updated will
142	  never be left in an intermediate state where one grant has been deleted but
143	  the second grant not yet added. Each change specifies a user or group grant
144	  to add or delete, and for grant additions, one of R, W, O (for the
145	  permission to be granted). A more formal description is provided in a later
146	  section; below we provide examples.
147	
148	<B>CH EXAMPLES</B>
149	  Examples for "ch" sub-command:
150	
151	  Grant anyone on the internet READ access to the object example-object:
152	
153	    gsutil acl ch -u allUsers:R gs://example-bucket/example-object
154	
155	  NOTE: By default, publicly readable objects are served with a Cache-Control
156	  header allowing such objects to be cached for 3600 seconds. If you need to
157	  ensure that updates become visible immediately, you should set a
158	  Cache-Control header of "Cache-Control:private, max-age=0, no-transform" on
159	  such objects. For help doing this, see "gsutil help setmeta".
160	
161	  Grant the user john.doe@example.com READ access to all objects
162	  in example-bucket that begin with folder/:
163	
164	    gsutil acl ch -r -u john.doe@example.com:R gs://example-bucket/folder/
165	
166	  Grant the group admins@example.com OWNER access to all jpg files in
167	  example-bucket:
168	
169	    gsutil acl ch -g admins@example.com:O gs://example-bucket/**.jpg
170	
171	  Grant the owners of project example-project WRITE access to the bucket
172	  example-bucket:
173	
174	    gsutil acl ch -p owners-example-project:W gs://example-bucket
175	
176	  NOTE: You can replace 'owners' with 'viewers' or 'editors' to grant access
177	  to a project's viewers/editors respectively.
178	
179	  Remove access to the bucket example-bucket for the viewers of project number
180	  12345:
181	
182	    gsutil acl ch -d viewers-12345 gs://example-bucket
183	
184	  NOTE: You cannot remove the project owners group from ACLs of gs:// buckets in
185	  the given project. Attempts to do so will appear to succeed, but the service
186	  will add the project owners group into the new set of ACLs before applying it.
187	
188	  Note that removing a project requires you to reference the project by
189	  its number (which you can see with the acl get command) as opposed to its
190	  project ID string.
191	
192	  Grant the service account foo@developer.gserviceaccount.com WRITE access to
193	  the bucket example-bucket:
194	
195	    gsutil acl ch -u foo@developer.gserviceaccount.com:W gs://example-bucket
196	
197	  Grant all users from the `G Suite
198	  <https://www.google.com/work/apps/business/>`_ domain my-domain.org READ
199	  access to the bucket gcs.my-domain.org:
200	
201	    gsutil acl ch -g my-domain.org:R gs://gcs.my-domain.org
202	
203	  Remove any current access by john.doe@example.com from the bucket
204	  example-bucket:
205	
206	    gsutil acl ch -d john.doe@example.com gs://example-bucket
207	
208	  If you have a large number of objects to update, enabling multi-threading
209	  with the gsutil -m flag can significantly improve performance. The
210	  following command adds OWNER for admin@example.org using
211	  multi-threading:
212	
213	    gsutil -m acl ch -r -u admin@example.org:O gs://example-bucket
214	
215	  Grant READ access to everyone from my-domain.org and to all authenticated
216	  users, and grant OWNER to admin@mydomain.org, for the buckets
217	  my-bucket and my-other-bucket, with multi-threading enabled:
218	
219	    gsutil -m acl ch -r -g my-domain.org:R -g AllAuth:R \\
220	      -u admin@mydomain.org:O gs://my-bucket/ gs://my-other-bucket
221	
222	<B>CH ROLES</B>
223	  You may specify the following roles with either their shorthand or
224	  their full name:
225	
226	    R: READ
227	    W: WRITE
228	    O: OWNER
229	
230	  For more information on these roles and the access they grant, see the
231	  permissions section of the `Access Control Lists page
232	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/lists#permissions>`_.
233	
234	<B>CH ENTITIES</B>
235	  There are four different entity types: Users, Groups, All Authenticated Users,
236	  and All Users.
237	
238	  Users are added with -u and a plain ID or email address, as in
239	  "-u john-doe@gmail.com:r". Note: Service Accounts are considered to be users.
240	
241	  Groups are like users, but specified with the -g flag, as in
242	  "-g power-users@example.com:O". Groups may also be specified as a full
243	  domain, as in "-g my-company.com:r".
244	
245	  allAuthenticatedUsers and allUsers are specified directly, as
246	  in "-g allUsers:R" or "-g allAuthenticatedUsers:O". These are case
247	  insensitive, and may be shortened to "all" and "allauth", respectively.
248	
249	  Removing roles is specified with the -d flag and an ID, email
250	  address, domain, or one of allUsers or allAuthenticatedUsers.
251	
252	  Many entities' roles can be specified on the same command line, allowing
253	  bundled changes to be executed in a single run. This will reduce the number of
254	  requests made to the server.
255	
256	<B>CH OPTIONS</B>
257	  The "ch" sub-command has the following options
258	
259	  -d          Remove all roles associated with the matching entity.
260	
261	  -f          Normally gsutil stops at the first error. The -f option causes
262	              it to continue when it encounters errors. With this option the
263	              gsutil exit status will be 0 even if some ACLs couldn't be

85	<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
86	  The ``gsutil cp`` command allows you to copy data between your local file
87	  system and the cloud, within the cloud, and between
88	  cloud storage providers. For example, to upload all text files from the
89	  local directory to a bucket, you can run:
90	
91	    gsutil cp *.txt gs://my-bucket
92	
93	  You can also download data from a bucket. The following command downloads
94	  all text files from the top-level of a bucket to your current directory:
95	
96	    gsutil cp gs://my-bucket/*.txt .
97	
98	  You can use the ``-n`` option to prevent overwriting the content of
99	  existing files. The following example downloads text files from a bucket
100	  without clobbering the data in your directory:
101	
102	    gsutil cp -n gs://my-bucket/*.txt .
103	
104	  Use the ``-r`` option to copy an entire directory tree.
105	  For example, to upload the directory tree ``dir``:
106	
107	    gsutil cp -r dir gs://my-bucket
108	
109	  If you have a large number of files to transfer, you can perform a parallel
110	  multi-threaded/multi-processing copy using the
111	  top-level gsutil ``-m`` option (see "gsutil help options"):
112	
113	    gsutil -m cp -r dir gs://my-bucket
114	
115	  You can use the ``-I`` option with ``stdin`` to specify a list of URLs to
116	  copy, one per line. This allows you to use gsutil
117	  in a pipeline to upload or download objects as generated by a program:
118	
119	    cat filelist | gsutil -m cp -I gs://my-bucket
120	
121	  or:
122	
123	    cat filelist | gsutil -m cp -I ./download_dir
124	
125	  where the output of ``cat filelist`` is a list of files, cloud URLs, and
126	  wildcards of files and cloud URLs.
127	
128	  NOTE: Shells like ``bash`` and ``zsh`` sometimes attempt to expand
129	  wildcards in ways that can be surprising. You may also encounter issues when
130	  attempting to copy files whose names contain wildcard characters. For more
131	  details about these issues, see `Wildcard behavior considerations

136	<B>HOW NAMES ARE CONSTRUCTED</B>
137	  The ``gsutil cp`` command attempts to name objects in ways that are consistent with the
138	  Linux ``cp`` command. This means that names are constructed depending
139	  on whether you're performing a recursive directory copy or copying
140	  individually-named objects, or whether you're copying to an existing or
141	  non-existent directory.
142	
143	  When you perform recursive directory copies, object names are constructed to
144	  mirror the source directory structure starting at the point of recursive
145	  processing. For example, if ``dir1/dir2`` contains the file ``a/b/c``, then the
146	  following command creates the object ``gs://my-bucket/dir2/a/b/c``:
147	
148	    gsutil cp -r dir1/dir2 gs://my-bucket
149	
150	  In contrast, copying individually-named files results in objects named by
151	  the final path component of the source files. For example, assuming again that
152	  ``dir1/dir2`` contains ``a/b/c``, the following command creates the object
153	  ``gs://my-bucket/c``:
154	
155	    gsutil cp dir1/dir2/** gs://my-bucket
156	
157	  Note that in the above example, the '**' wildcard matches all names
158	  anywhere under ``dir``. The wildcard '*' matches names just one level deep. For
159	  more details, see `URI wildcards
160	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/wildcards#surprising-behavior>`_.
161	
162	  The same rules apply for uploads and downloads: recursive copies of buckets and
163	  bucket subdirectories produce a mirrored filename structure, while copying
164	  individually or wildcard-named objects produce flatly-named files.
165	
166	  In addition, the resulting names depend on whether the destination subdirectory
167	  exists. For example, if ``gs://my-bucket/subdir`` exists as a subdirectory,
168	  the following command creates the object ``gs://my-bucket/subdir/dir2/a/b/c``:
169	
170	    gsutil cp -r dir1/dir2 gs://my-bucket/subdir
171	
172	  In contrast, if ``gs://my-bucket/subdir`` does not exist, this same ``gsutil cp``
173	  command creates the object ``gs://my-bucket/subdir/a/b/c``.
174	
175	  NOTE: The
176	  `Google Cloud Platform Console <https://console.cloud.google.com>`_
177	  creates folders by creating "placeholder" objects that end
178	  with a "/" character. gsutil skips these objects when downloading from the
179	  cloud to the local file system, because creating a file that
180	  ends with a "/" is not allowed on Linux and macOS. We
181	  recommend that you only create objects that end with "/" if you don't
182	  intend to download such objects using gsutil.

392	
393	                 NOTE: ``-c`` only applies to the actual copying operation. If an
394	                 error, such as ``invalid Unicode file name``, occurs while iterating
395	                 over the files in the local directory, gsutil prints an error
396	                 message and aborts.
397	
398	  -D             Copy in "daisy chain" mode, which means copying between two buckets
399	                 by first downloading to the machine where gsutil is run, then
400	                 uploading to the destination bucket. The default mode is a
401	                 "copy in the cloud," where data is copied between two buckets without
402	                 uploading or downloading.
403	
404	                 During a "copy in the cloud," a source composite object remains composite
405	                 at its destination. However, you can use "daisy chain" mode to change a
406	                 composite object into a non-composite object. For example:
407	
408	                     gsutil cp -D gs://bucket/obj gs://bucket/obj_tmp
409	                     gsutil mv gs://bucket/obj_tmp gs://bucket/obj
410	
411	                 NOTE: "Daisy chain" mode is automatically used when copying
412	                 between providers: for example, when copying data from Cloud Storage
413	                 to another provider.
414	
415	  -e             Exclude symlinks. When specified, symbolic links are not copied.
416	
417	  -I             Use ``stdin`` to specify a list of files or objects to copy. You can use
418	                 gsutil in a pipeline to upload or download objects as generated by a program.
419	                 For example:
420	
421	                   cat filelist | gsutil -m cp -I gs://my-bucket
422	
423	                 where the output of ``cat filelist`` is a one-per-line list of
424	                 files, cloud URLs, and wildcards of files and cloud URLs.
425	
426	  -j <ext,...>   Applies gzip transport encoding to any file upload whose
427	                 extension matches the ``-j`` extension list. This is useful when
428	                 uploading files with compressible content such as .js, .css,
429	                 or .html files. This also saves network bandwidth while
430	                 leaving the data uncompressed in Cloud Storage.
431	
432	                 When you specify the ``-j`` option, files being uploaded are
433	                 compressed in-memory and on-the-wire only. Both the local
434	                 files and Cloud Storage objects remain uncompressed. The
435	                 uploaded objects retain the ``Content-Type`` and name of the
436	                 original files.
437	
438	                 Note that if you want to use the ``-m`` `top-level option
439	                 <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/addlhelp/GlobalCommandLineOptions>`_
440	                 to parallelize copies along with the ``-j/-J`` options, your
441	                 performance may be bottlenecked by the
442	                 "max_upload_compression_buffer_size" boto config option,
443	                 which is set to 2 GiB by default. You can change this
444	                 compression buffer size to a higher limit. For example:
445	
446	                   gsutil -o "GSUtil:max_upload_compression_buffer_size=8G" \\
447	                     -m cp -j html,txt -r /local/source/dir gs://bucket/path
448	
449	  -J             Applies gzip transport encoding to file uploads. This option
450	                 works like the ``-j`` option described above, but it applies to
451	                 all uploaded files, regardless of extension.
452	
453	                 CAUTION: If some of the source files don't compress well, such
454	                 as binary data, using this option may result in longer uploads.
455	
456	  -L <file>      Outputs a manifest log file with detailed information about
457	                 each item that was copied. This manifest contains the following
458	                 information for each item:
459	
460	                 - Source path.
461	                 - Destination path.
462	                 - Source size.
463	                 - Bytes transferred.
464	                 - MD5 hash.
465	                 - Transfer start time and date in UTC and ISO 8601 format.
466	                 - Transfer completion time and date in UTC and ISO 8601 format.
467	                 - Upload id, if a resumable upload was performed.
468	                 - Final result of the attempted transfer, either success or failure.
469	                 - Failure details, if any.
470	
471	                 If the log file already exists, gsutil uses the file as an
472	                 input to the copy process, and appends log items to
473	                 the existing file. Objects that are marked in the
474	                 existing log file as having been successfully copied or
475	                 skipped are ignored. Objects without entries are
476	                 copied and ones previously marked as unsuccessful are
477	                 retried. This option can be used in conjunction with the ``-c`` option to
478	                 build a script that copies a large number of objects reliably,
479	                 using a bash script like the following:
480	
481	                   until gsutil cp -c -L cp.log -r ./dir gs://bucket; do
482	                     sleep 1
483	                   done
484	
485	                 The -c option enables copying to continue after failures
486	                 occur, and the -L option allows gsutil to pick up where it
487	                 left off without duplicating work. The loop continues
488	                 running as long as gsutil exits with a non-zero status. A non-zero
489	                 status indicates there was at least one failure during the copy
490	                 operation.
491	
492	                 NOTE: If you are synchronizing the contents of a
493	                 directory and a bucket, or the contents of two buckets, see
494	                 "gsutil help rsync".
495	
496	  -n             No-clobber. When specified, existing files or objects at the
497	                 destination are not replaced. Any items that are skipped
498	                 by this option are reported as skipped. gsutil
499	                 performs an additional GET request to check if an item
500	                 exists before attempting to upload the data. This saves gsutil
501	                 from retransmitting data, but the additional HTTP requests may make
502	                 small object transfers slower and more expensive.
503	
504	  -p             Preserves ACLs when copying in the cloud. Note
505	                 that this option has performance and cost implications only when
506	                 using the XML API, as the XML API requires separate HTTP calls for
507	                 interacting with ACLs. You can mitigate this
508	                 performance issue using ``gsutil -m cp`` to perform parallel
509	                 copying. Note that this option only works if you have OWNER access
510	                 to all objects that are copied. If you want all objects in the
511	                 destination bucket to end up with the same ACL, you can avoid these
512	                 performance issues by setting a default object ACL on that bucket
513	                 instead of using ``cp -p``. See "gsutil help defacl".
514	
515	                 Note that it's not valid to specify both the ``-a`` and ``-p`` options
516	                 together.
517	
518	  -P             Enables POSIX attributes to be preserved when objects are
519	                 copied. ``gsutil cp`` copies fields provided by ``stat``. These fields
520	                 are the user ID of the owner, the group
521	                 ID of the owning group, the mode or permissions of the file, and
522	                 the access and modification time of the file. For downloads, these
523	                 attributes are only set if the source objects were uploaded
524	                 with this flag enabled.
525	
526	                 On Windows, this flag only sets and restores access time and
527	                 modification time. This is because Windows doesn't support
528	                 POSIX uid/gid/mode.
529	
530	  -R, -r         The ``-R`` and ``-r`` options are synonymous. They enable directories,
531	                 buckets, and bucket subdirectories to be copied recursively.
532	                 If you don't use this option for an upload, gsutil copies objects
533	                 it finds and skips directories. Similarly, if you don't
534	                 specify this option for a download, gsutil copies
535	                 objects at the current bucket directory level and skips subdirectories.
536	
537	  -s <class>     Specifies the storage class of the destination object. If not
538	                 specified, the default storage class of the destination bucket
539	                 is used. This option is not valid for copying to non-cloud destinations.
540	
541	  -U             Skips objects with unsupported object types instead of failing.
542	                 Unsupported object types include Amazon S3 objects in the GLACIER
543	                 storage class.
544	
545	  -v             Prints the version-specific URL for each uploaded object. You can
546	                 use these URLs to safely make concurrent upload requests, because
547	                 Cloud Storage refuses to perform an update if the current
548	                 object version doesn't match the version-specific URL. See
549	                 `generation numbers
550	                 <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/metadata#generation-number>`_
551	                 for more details.
552	
553	  -z <ext,...>   Applies gzip content-encoding to any file upload whose
554	                 extension matches the ``-z`` extension list. This is useful when
555	                 uploading files with compressible content such as .js, .css,
556	                 or .html files, because it reduces network bandwidth and storage
557	                 sizes. This can both improve performance and reduce costs.
558	
559	                 When you specify the ``-z`` option, the data from your files is
560	                 compressed before it is uploaded, but your actual files are
561	                 left uncompressed on the local disk. The uploaded objects
562	                 retain the ``Content-Type`` and name of the original files, but
563	                 have their ``Content-Encoding`` metadata set to ``gzip`` to
564	                 indicate that the object data stored are compressed on the
565	                 Cloud Storage servers and have their ``Cache-Control`` metadata
566	                 set to ``no-transform``.
567	
568	                 For example, the following command:
569	
570	                   gsutil cp -z html \\
571	                     cattypes.html tabby.jpeg gs://mycats
572	
573	                 does the following:
574	
575	                 - The ``cp`` command uploads the files ``cattypes.html`` and
576	                   ``tabby.jpeg`` to the bucket ``gs://mycats``.
577	                 - Based on the file extensions, gsutil sets the ``Content-Type``
578	                   of ``cattypes.html`` to ``text/html`` and ``tabby.jpeg`` to
579	                   ``image/jpeg``.
580	                 - The ``-z`` option compresses the data in the file ``cattypes.html``.
581	                 - The ``-z`` option also sets the ``Content-Encoding`` for
582	                   ``cattypes.html`` to ``gzip`` and the ``Cache-Control`` for
583	                   ``cattypes.html`` to ``no-transform``.
584	
585	                 Because the ``-z/-Z`` options compress data prior to upload, they
586	                 are not subject to the same compression buffer bottleneck that
587	                 can affect the ``-j/-J`` options.
588	
589	                 Note that if you download an object with ``Content-Encoding:gzip``,
590	                 gsutil decompresses the content before writing the local file.
591	
592	  -Z             Applies gzip content-encoding to file uploads. This option
593	                 works like the ``-z`` option described above, but it applies to
594	                 all uploaded files, regardless of extension.
595	
596	                 CAUTION: If some of the source files don't compress well, such
597	                 as binary data, using this option may result in files taking up
598	                 more space in the cloud than they would if left uncompressed.
599	
600	  --stet         If the STET binary can be found in boto or PATH, cp will
601	                 use the split-trust encryption tool for end-to-end encryption.

131	_CREATE_DESCRIPTION = """
132	<B>CREATE</B>
133	  The create sub-command creates a notification config on a bucket, establishing
134	  a flow of event notifications from Cloud Storage to a Cloud Pub/Sub topic. As
135	  part of creating this flow, the create command also verifies that the
136	  destination Cloud Pub/Sub topic exists, creating it if necessary, and verifies
137	  that the Cloud Storage bucket has permission to publish events to that topic,
138	  granting the permission if necessary.
139	
140	  If a destination Cloud Pub/Sub topic is not specified with the -t flag, Cloud
141	  Storage chooses a topic name in the default project whose ID is the same as
142	  the bucket name. For example, if the default project ID specified is
143	  'default-project' and the bucket being configured is gs://example-bucket, the
144	  create command uses the Cloud Pub/Sub topic
145	  "projects/default-project/topics/example-bucket".
146	
147	  In order to enable notifications, your project's `Cloud Storage service agent
148	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects#service-accounts>`_ must have
149	  the IAM permission "pubsub.topics.publish". This command checks to see if the
150	  destination Cloud Pub/Sub topic grants the service agent this permission. If
151	  not, the create command attempts to grant it.
152	
153	  A bucket can have up to 100 total notification configurations and up to 10
154	  notification configurations set to trigger for a specific event.
155	
156	<B>CREATE EXAMPLES</B>
157	  Begin sending notifications of all changes to the bucket example-bucket
158	  to the Cloud Pub/Sub topic projects/default-project/topics/example-bucket:
159	
160	    gsutil notification create -f json gs://example-bucket
161	
162	  The same as above, but specifies the destination topic ID 'files-to-process'
163	  in the default project:
164	
165	    gsutil notification create -f json \\
166	      -t files-to-process gs://example-bucket
167	
168	  The same as above, but specifies a Cloud Pub/Sub topic belonging to the
169	  specific cloud project 'example-project':
170	
171	    gsutil notification create -f json \\
172	      -t projects/example-project/topics/files-to-process gs://example-bucket
173	
174	  Create a notification config that only sends an event when a new object
175	  has been created:
176	
177	    gsutil notification create -f json -e OBJECT_FINALIZE gs://example-bucket
178	
179	  Create a topic and notification config that only sends an event when
180	  an object beginning with "photos/" is affected:
181	
182	    gsutil notification create -p photos/ gs://example-bucket
183	
184	  List all of the notificationConfigs in bucket example-bucket:
185	
186	    gsutil notification list gs://example-bucket
187	
188	  Delete all notitificationConfigs for bucket example-bucket:
189	
190	    gsutil notification delete gs://example-bucket
191	
192	  Delete one specific notificationConfig for bucket example-bucket:
193	
194	    gsutil notification delete \\
195	      projects/_/buckets/example-bucket/notificationConfigs/1
196	
197	<B>OPTIONS</B>
198	  The create sub-command has the following options
199	
200	  -e        Specify an event type filter for this notification config. Cloud
201	            Storage only sends notifications of this type. You may specify this
202	            parameter multiple times to allow multiple event types. If not
203	            specified, Cloud Storage sends notifications for all event types.
204	            The valid types are:
205	
206	              OBJECT_FINALIZE - An object has been created.
207	              OBJECT_METADATA_UPDATE - The metadata of an object has changed.
208	              OBJECT_DELETE - An object has been permanently deleted.
209	              OBJECT_ARCHIVE - A live version of an object has become a
210	                noncurrent version.
211	
212	  -f        Specifies the payload format of notification messages. Must be
213	            either "json" for a payload matches the object metadata for the
214	            JSON API, or "none" to specify no payload at all. In either case,
215	            notification details are available in the message attributes.
216	
217	  -m        Specifies a key:value attribute that is appended to the set
218	            of attributes sent to Cloud Pub/Sub for all events associated with
219	            this notification config. You may specify this parameter multiple
220	            times to set multiple attributes.
221	
222	  -p        Specifies a prefix path filter for this notification config. Cloud
223	            Storage only sends notifications for objects in this bucket whose
224	            names begin with the specified prefix.
225	
226	  -s        Skips creation and permission assignment of the Cloud Pub/Sub topic.
227	            This is useful if the caller does not have permission to access
228	            the topic in question, or if the topic already exists and has the
229	            appropriate publish permission assigned.
230	
231	  -t        The Cloud Pub/Sub topic to which notifications should be sent. If
232	            not specified, this command chooses a topic whose project is your
233	            default project and whose ID is the same as the Cloud Storage bucket
234	            name.
235	
236	<B>NEXT STEPS</B>
237	  Once the create command has succeeded, Cloud Storage publishes a message to
238	  the specified Cloud Pub/Sub topic when eligible changes occur. In order to
239	  receive these messages, you must create a Pub/Sub subscription for your
240	  Pub/Sub topic. To learn more about creating Pub/Sub subscriptions, see `the
241	  Pub/Sub Subscriber Overview <https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber>`_.
242	
243	  You can create a simple Pub/Sub subscription using the ``gcloud`` command-line
244	  tool. For example, to create a new subscription on the topic "myNewTopic" and
245	  attempt to pull messages from it, you could run:
246	
247	    gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions create --topic myNewTopic testSubscription
248	    gcloud beta pubsub subscriptions pull --auto-ack testSubscription

79	<B>SET</B>
80	  You can configure a data retention policy for a Cloud Storage bucket that
81	  governs how long objects in the bucket must be retained. You can also lock the
82	  data retention policy, permanently preventing the policy from being reduced or
83	  removed. For more information, see `Retention policies and Bucket Lock
84	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-lock>`_.
85	
86	  The ``gsutil retention set`` command allows you to set or update the
87	  retention policy on one or more buckets.
88	
89	  To remove an unlocked retention policy from one or more
90	  buckets, use the ``gsutil retention clear`` command.
91	
92	  The ``set`` sub-command can set a retention policy with the following formats:
93	
94	<B>SET FORMATS</B>
95	  Formats for the ``set`` subcommand include:
96	
97	  <number>s
98	      Specifies retention period of <number> seconds for objects in this bucket.
99	
100	  <number>d
101	      Specifies retention period of <number> days for objects in this bucket.
102	
103	  <number>m
104	      Specifies retention period of <number> months for objects in this bucket.
105	
106	  <number>y
107	      Specifies retention period of <number> years for objects in this bucket.
108	
109	  GCS JSON API accepts retention periods as number of seconds. Durations provided
110	  in terms of days, months or years are converted to their rough equivalent
111	  values in seconds, using the following conversions:
112	
113	  - A month is considered to be 31 days or 2,678,400 seconds.
114	  - A year is considered to be 365.25 days or 31,557,600 seconds.
115	
116	  Retention periods must be greater than 0 and less than 100 years.
117	  Retention durations must be in only one form (seconds, days, months,
118	  or years), and not a combination of them.
119	
120	  Note that while it is possible to specify retention durations
121	  shorter than a day (using seconds), enforcement of such retention periods is not
122	  guaranteed. Such durations may only be used for testing purposes.

132	
133	  You can also provide a precondition on a bucket's metageneration in order to
134	  avoid potential race conditions. You can use gsutil's '-h' option to specify
135	  preconditions. For example, the following specifies a precondition that checks
136	  a bucket's metageneration before setting the retention policy on the bucket:
137	
138	    gsutil -h "x-goog-if-metageneration-match: 1" \\

73	  The gsutil test command runs the gsutil unit tests and integration tests.
74	  The unit tests use an in-memory mock storage service implementation, while
75	  the integration tests send requests to the production service using the
76	  `preferred API
77	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#gsutil>`_ set in the
78	  boto configuration file.
79	
80	  CAUTION: The ``test`` command creates test buckets and objects in your project.
81	  Force quitting the ``test`` command can leave behind stale buckets, objects,
82	  and HMAC keys in your project.
83	
84	  To run both the unit tests and integration tests, run the command with no
85	  arguments:
86	
87	    gsutil test
88	
89	  To run the unit tests only (which run quickly):
90	
91	    gsutil test -u
92	
93	  Tests run in parallel regardless of whether the top-level -m flag is
94	  present. To limit the number of tests run in parallel to 10 at a time:
95	
96	    gsutil test -p 10
97	
98	  To force tests to run sequentially:
99	
100	    gsutil test -p 1
101	
102	  To have sequentially-run tests stop running immediately when an error occurs:
103	
104	    gsutil test -f
105	
106	  To run tests for one or more individual commands add those commands as
107	  arguments. For example, the following command will run the cp and mv command
108	  tests:
109	
110	    gsutil test cp mv
111	
112	  To list available tests, run the test command with the -l argument:
113	
114	    gsutil test -l
115	
116	  The tests are defined in the code under the gslib/tests module. Each test
117	  file is of the format test_[name].py where [name] is the test name you can
118	  pass to this command. For example, running "gsutil test ls" would run the
119	  tests in "gslib/tests/test_ls.py".
120	
121	  You can also run an individual test class or function name by passing the
122	  test module followed by the class name and optionally a test name. For
123	  example, to run the an entire test class by name:
124	
125	    gsutil test naming.GsutilNamingTests
126	
127	  or an individual test function:
128	
129	    gsutil test cp.TestCp.test_streaming
130	
131	  You can list the available tests under a module or class by passing arguments
132	  with the -l option. For example, to list all available test functions in the
133	  cp module:
134	
135	    gsutil test -l cp
136	
137	  To output test coverage:
138	
139	    gsutil test -c -p 500
140	    coverage html
141	
142	  This will output an HTML report to a directory named 'htmlcov'.
143	
144	  Test coverage is compatible with v4.1 of the coverage module
145	  (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage).
146	
147	
148	<B>OPTIONS</B>
149	  -b          Run tests against multi-regional US buckets. By default,
150	              tests run against regional buckets in us-central1.
151	
152	  -c          Output coverage information.
153	
154	  -f          Exit on first sequential test failure.
155	
156	  -l          List available tests.
157	
158	  -p N        Run at most N tests in parallel. The default value is %d.
159	
160	  -s          Run tests against S3 instead of GS.
161

78	  Cloud Storage allows you to configure a bucket to behave like a static
79	  website when the bucket is accessed through a `custom domain
80	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints#custom-domains>`_.
81	  For example, if you set a ``main_page_suffix``, a subsequent GET bucket
82	  request through a custom domain serves the specified "main" page instead of
83	  performing the usual bucket listing. Similarly, if you set an ``error_page``,
84	  a subsequent GET object request through a custom domain for a non-existent
85	  object serves the specified error page instead of the standard Cloud Storage
86	  error.
87	
88	  Requests to a bucket through other `endpoints
89	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-endpoints>`_ are unaffected
90	  by the bucket's website configuration.
91	
92	  See `Static website examples and tips
93	  <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/static-website>`_ for additional
94	  examples and information.
95	
96	  Notes:
97	
98	  1. Because the main page is only served when a bucket listing request is made
99	     via a custom domain endpoint, you can continue to use ``gsutil ls`` as you
100	     normally would for bucket listing.
101	
102	  2. The main_page_suffix applies to each subdirectory of the bucket. For
103	     example, with the main_page_suffix configured to be index.html, a GET
104	     request for ``http://www.example.com`` retrieves
105	     ``http://www.example.com/index.html`` but shows ``http://www.example.com`` as
106	     the URL to the requester, and a GET request for
107	     ``http://www.example.com/photos`` retrieves
108	     ``http://www.example.com/photos/index.html`` but shows ``http://www.example.com/photos``
109	     as the URL to the requester.
110	
111	  3. There is just one 404.html page. For example, a GET request for
112	     ``http://www.example.com/photos/missing`` retrieves
113	     ``http://www.example.com/404.html``, not
114	     ``http://www.example.com/photos/404.html``.
