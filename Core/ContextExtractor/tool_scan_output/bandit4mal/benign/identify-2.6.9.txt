198	GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
199	                       Version 3, 19 November 2007
200	
201	 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
202	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
203	 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
204	
205	                            Preamble
206	
207	  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
208	software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
209	cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
210	
211	  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
212	to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
213	our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
214	share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
215	software for all its users.
216	
217	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
218	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
219	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
220	them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
221	want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
222	free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
223	
224	  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
225	with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
226	you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
227	and/or modify the software.
228	
229	  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
230	improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
231	receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
232	incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
233	encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
234	software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
235	The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
236	letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
237	source code to the public.
238	
239	  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
240	ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
241	to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
242	provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
243	users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
244	a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
245	code of the modified version.
246	
247	  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
248	published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
249	a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
250	released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
251	this license.
252	
253	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
254	modification follow.
255	
256	                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
257	
258	  0. Definitions.
259	
260	  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
261	
262	  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
263	works, such as semiconductor masks.
264	
265	  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
266	License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
267	"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
268	
269	  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
270	in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
271	exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
272	earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
273	
274	  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
275	on the Program.
276	
277	  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
278	permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
279	infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
280	computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
281	distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
282	public, and in some countries other activities as well.
283	
284	  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
285	parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
286	a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
287	
288	  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
289	to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
290	feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
291	tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
292	extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
293	work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
294	the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
295	menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
296	
297	  1. Source Code.
298	
299	  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
300	for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
301	form of a work.
302	
303	  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
304	standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
305	interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
306	is widely used among developers working in that language.
307	
308	  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
309	than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
310	packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
311	Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
312	Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
313	implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
314	"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
315	(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
316	(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
317	produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
318	
319	  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
320	the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
321	work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
322	control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
323	System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
324	programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
325	which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
326	includes interface definition files associated with source files for
327	the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
328	linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
329	such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
330	subprograms and other parts of the work.
331	
332	  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
333	can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
334	Source.
335	
336	  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
337	same work.
338	
339	  2. Basic Permissions.
340	
341	  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
342	copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
343	conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
344	permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
345	covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
346	content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
347	rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
348	
349	  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
350	convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
351	in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
352	of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
353	with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
354	the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
355	not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
356	for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
357	and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
358	your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
359	
360	  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
361	the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
362	makes it unnecessary.
363	
364	  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
365	
366	  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
367	measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
368	11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
369	similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
370	measures.
371	
372	  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
373	circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
374	is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
375	the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
376	modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
377	users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
378	technological measures.
379	
380	  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
381	
382	  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
383	receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
384	appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
385	keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
386	non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
387	keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
388	recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
389	
390	  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
391	and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
392	
393	  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
394	
395	  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
396	produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
397	terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
398	
399	    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
400	    it, and giving a relevant date.
401	
402	    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
403	    released under this License and any conditions added under section
404	    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
405	    "keep intact all notices".
406	
407	    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
408	    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
409	    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
410	    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
411	    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
412	    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
413	    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
414	
415	    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
416	    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
417	    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
418	    work need not make them do so.
419	
420	  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
421	works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
422	and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
423	in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
424	"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
425	used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
426	beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
427	in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
428	parts of the aggregate.
429	
430	  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
431	
432	  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
433	of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
434	machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
435	in one of these ways:
436	
437	    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
438	    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
439	    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
440	    customarily used for software interchange.
441	
442	    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
443	    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
444	    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
445	    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
446	    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
447	    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
448	    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
449	    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
450	    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
451	    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
452	    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
453	
454	    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
455	    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
456	    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
457	    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
458	    with subsection 6b.
459	
460	    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
461	    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
462	    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
463	    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
464	    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
465	    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
466	    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
467	    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
468	    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
469	    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
470	    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
471	    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
472	
473	    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
474	    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
475	    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
476	    charge under subsection 6d.
477	
478	  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
479	from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
480	included in conveying the object code work.
481	
482	  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
483	tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
484	or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
485	into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
486	doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
487	product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
488	typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
489	of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
490	actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
491	is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
492	commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
493	the only significant mode of use of the product.
494	
495	  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
496	procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
497	and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
498	a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
499	suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
500	code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
501	modification has been made.
502	
503	  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
504	specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
505	part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
506	User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
507	fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
508	Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
509	by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
510	if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
511	modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
512	been installed in ROM).
513	
514	  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
515	requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
516	for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
517	the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
518	network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
519	adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
520	protocols for communication across the network.
521	
522	  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
523	in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
524	documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
525	source code form), and must require no special password or key for
526	unpacking, reading or copying.
527	
528	  7. Additional Terms.
529	
530	  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
531	License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
532	Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
533	be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
534	that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
535	apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
536	under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
537	this License without regard to the additional permissions.
538	
539	  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
540	remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
541	it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
542	removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
543	additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
544	for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
545	
546	  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
547	add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
548	that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
549	
550	    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
551	    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
552	
553	    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
554	    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
555	    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
556	
557	    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
558	    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
559	    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
560	
561	    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
562	    authors of the material; or
563	
564	    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
565	    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
566	
567	    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
568	    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
569	    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
570	    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
571	    those licensors and authors.
572	
573	  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
574	restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
575	received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
576	governed by this License along with a term that is a further
577	restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
578	a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
579	License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
580	of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
581	not survive such relicensing or conveying.
582	
583	  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
584	must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
585	additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
586	where to find the applicable terms.
587	
588	  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
589	form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
590	the above requirements apply either way.
591	
592	  8. Termination.
593	
594	  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
595	provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
596	modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
597	this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
598	paragraph of section 11).
599	
600	  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
601	license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
602	provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
603	finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
604	holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
605	prior to 60 days after the cessation.
606	
607	  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
608	reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
609	violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
610	received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
611	copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
612	your receipt of the notice.
613	
614	  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
615	licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
616	this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
617	reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
618	material under section 10.
619	
620	  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
621	
622	  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
623	run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
624	occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
625	to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
626	nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
627	modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
628	not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
629	covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
630	
631	  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
632	
633	  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
634	receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
635	propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
636	for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
637	
638	  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
639	organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
640	organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
641	work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
642	transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
643	licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
644	give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
645	Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
646	the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
647	
648	  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
649	rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
650	not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
651	rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
652	(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
653	any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
654	sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
655	
656	  11. Patents.
657	
658	  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
659	License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
660	work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
661	
662	  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
663	owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
664	hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
665	by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
666	but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
667	consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
668	purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
669	patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
670	this License.
671	
672	  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
673	patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
674	make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
675	propagate the contents of its contributor version.
676	
677	  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
678	agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
679	(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
680	sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
681	party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
682	patent against the party.
683	
684	  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
685	and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
686	to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
687	publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
688	then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
689	available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
690	patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
691	consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
692	license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
693	actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
694	covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
695	in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
696	country that you have reason to believe are valid.
697	
698	  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
699	arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
700	covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
701	receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
702	or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
703	you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
704	work and works based on it.
705	
706	  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
707	the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
708	conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
709	specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
710	work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
711	in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
712	to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
713	the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
714	parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
715	patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
716	conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
717	for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
718	contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
719	or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
720	
721	  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
722	any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
723	otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
724	
725	  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
726	
727	  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
728	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
729	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
730	covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
731	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
732	not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
733	to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
734	the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
735	License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
736	
737	  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
738	
739	  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
740	Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
741	interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
742	supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
743	Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
744	from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
745	means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
746	shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
747	of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
748	following paragraph.
749	
750	  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
751	permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
752	under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
753	combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
754	License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
755	but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
756	3 of the GNU General Public License.
757	
758	  14. Revised Versions of this License.
759	
760	  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
761	the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
762	will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
763	address new problems or concerns.
764	
765	  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
766	Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
767	Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
768	option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
769	version or of any later version published by the Free Software
770	Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
771	GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
772	by the Free Software Foundation.
773	
774	  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
775	versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
776	public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
777	to choose that version for the Program.
778	
779	  Later license versions may give you additional or different
780	permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
781	author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
782	later version.
783	
784	  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
785	
786	  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
787	APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
788	HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
789	OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
790	THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
791	PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
792	IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
793	ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
794	
795	  16. Limitation of Liability.
796	
797	  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
798	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
799	THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
800	GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
801	USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
802	DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
803	PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
804	EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
805	SUCH DAMAGES.
806	
807	  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
808	
809	  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
810	above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
811	reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
812	an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
813	Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
814	copy of the Program in return for a fee.
815	
816	                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
817	
818	            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
819	
820	  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
821	possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
822	free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
823	
824	  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
825	to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
826	state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
827	the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
828	
829	    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
830	    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
831	
832	    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
833	    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published
834	    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
835	    (at your option) any later version.
836	
837	    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
838	    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
839	    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
840	    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
841	
842	    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
843	    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
844	
845	Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
846	
847	  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
848	network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
849	get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
850	interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
851	of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
852	solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
853	specific requirements.
854	
855	  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
856	if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
857	For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see

868	   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
869	
870	   1. Definitions.
871	
872	      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
873	      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
874	
875	      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
876	      the copyright owner that is granting the License.
877	
878	      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
879	      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
880	      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
881	      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
882	      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
883	      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
884	      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
885	
886	      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
887	      exercising permissions granted by this License.
888	
889	      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
890	      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
891	      source, and configuration files.
892	
893	      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
894	      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
895	      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
896	      and conversions to other media types.
897	
898	      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
899	      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
900	      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
901	      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
902	
903	      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
904	      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
905	      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
906	      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
907	      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
908	      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
909	      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
910	
911	      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
912	      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
913	      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
914	      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
915	      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
916	      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
917	      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
918	      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
919	      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
920	      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
921	      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
922	      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
923	      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
924	
925	      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
926	      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
927	      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
928	
929	   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
930	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
931	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
932	      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
933	      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
934	      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
935	
936	   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
937	      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
938	      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
939	      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
940	      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
941	      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
942	      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
943	      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
944	      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
945	      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
946	      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
947	      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
948	      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
949	      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
950	      as of the date such litigation is filed.
951	
952	   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
953	      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
954	      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
955	      meet the following conditions:
956	
957	      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
958	          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
959	
960	      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
961	          stating that You changed the files; and
962	
963	      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
964	          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
965	          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
966	          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
967	          the Derivative Works; and
968	
969	      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
970	          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
971	          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
972	          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
973	          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
974	          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
975	          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
976	          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
977	          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
978	          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
979	          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
980	          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
981	          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
982	          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
983	          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
984	          as modifying the License.
985	
986	      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
987	      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
988	      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
989	      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
990	      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
991	      the conditions stated in this License.
992	
993	   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
994	      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
995	      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
996	      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
997	      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
998	      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
999	      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
1000	
1001	   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
1002	      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
1003	      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
1004	      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
1005	
1006	   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
1007	      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
1008	      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
1009	      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
1010	      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
1011	      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
1012	      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
1013	      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
1014	      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
1015	
1016	   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
1017	      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
1018	      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
1019	      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
1020	      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
1021	      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
1022	      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

1024	      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
1025	      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
1026	      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
1027	
1028	   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

1032	      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
1033	      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

1035	      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
1036	      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

2236	        '''\
2237	CC0 1.0 Universal
2238	
2239	Statement of Purpose
2240	
2241	The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
2242	exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
2243	subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
2244	authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
2245	
2246	Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
2247	purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
2248	works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
2249	claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
2250	and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
2251	purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
2252	contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
2253	further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
2254	reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
2255	efforts of others.
2256	
2257	For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
2258	of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
2259	Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
2260	and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
2261	and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
2262	Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
2263	effect of CC0 on those rights.
2264	
2265	1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
2266	protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
2267	Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
2268	to, the following:
2269	
2270	  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
2271	  and translate a Work;
2272	
2273	  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
2274	
2275	  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
2276	  depicted in a Work;
2277	
2278	  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
2279	  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
2280	
2281	  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
2282	  a Work;
2283	
2284	  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
2285	  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
2286	  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
2287	  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
2288	
2289	  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
2290	  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2291	
2292	2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
2293	applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
2294	unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
2295	and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
2296	known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
2297	action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
2298	duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
2299	extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
2300	copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
2301	commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
2302	the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
2303	detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
2304	shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
2305	any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
2306	by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
2307	
2308	3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
2309	judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
2310	shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
2311	Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
2312	is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
2313	non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
2314	unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
2315	the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
2316	provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
2317	in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
2318	purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
2319	promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
2320	of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
2321	License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
2322	applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
2323	invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
2324	affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
2325	Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
2326	and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
2327	Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
2328	
2329	4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
2330	
2331	  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
2332	  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
2333	
2334	  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
2335	  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
2336	  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
2337	  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
2338	  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
2339	  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
2340	
2341	  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
2342	  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
2343	  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
2344	  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
2345	  or other rights required for any use of the Work.
2346	
2347	  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
2348	  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
2349	  CC0 or use of the Work.

2398	
2399	"Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form,
2400	made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is
2401	included in or attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix
2402	below).
2403	
2404	"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that
2405	is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions,
2406	annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an
2407	original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative
2408	Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or
2409	bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
2410	
2411	"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
2412	version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
2413	Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for
2414	inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal

2423	
2424	"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf
2425	of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently

2428	2. Grant of Copyright License.
2429	
2430	Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby
2431	grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
2432	irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
2433	publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and
2434	such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
2435	
2436	3. Grant of Patent License.
2437	
2438	Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby

2440	irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
2441	made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where
2442	such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such
2443	Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or
2444	by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such
2445	Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any
2446	entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
2447	the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
2448	contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You
2449	under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
2450	litigation is filed. Any patent license granted hereby with respect to
2451	contributions by an individual employed by an institution or organization is
2452	limited to patent claims where the individual that is the author of the Work
2453	is also the inventor of the patent claims licensed, and where the organization
2454	or institution has the right to grant such license under applicable grant and
2455	research funding agreements. No other express or implied licenses are granted.
2456	
2457	4. Redistribution.
2458

2460	thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object
2461	form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
2462	
2463	You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
2464	this License; and You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
2465	stating that You changed the files; and You must retain, in the Source form of
2466	any Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark,
2467	and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those
2468	notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and If the
2469	Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
2470	Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the
2471	attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices
2472	that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
2473	the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
2474	Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along
2475	with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
2476	Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
2477	of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
2478	License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that
2479	You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
2480	provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
2481	modifying the License. You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
2482	modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and
2483	conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
2484	for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
2485	distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this
2486	License.
2487	
2488	5. Submission of Contributions.
2489	
2490	Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
2491	submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the
2492	terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
2493	conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or
2494	modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with
2495	Licensor regarding such Contributions.
2496	
2497	6. Trademarks.
2498	
2499	This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
2500	service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
2501	reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
2502	reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
2503	
2504	7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
2505	
2506	Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides
2507	the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
2508	BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
2509	implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
2510	NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You
2511	are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
2512	redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
2513	permissions under this License.
2514	
2515	8. Limitation of Liability.
2516	
2517	In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
2518	contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
2519	and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
2520	liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
2521	incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of
2522	this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not
2523	limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
2524	malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
2525	Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
2526	
2527	9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
2528	
2529	While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
2530	offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
2531	other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
2532	However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
2533	and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and
2534	only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for
2535	any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
2536	reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

3998	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies

4001	                            Preamble
4002	
4003	  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
4004	software and other kinds of works.
4005	
4006	  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
4007	to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
4008	the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
4009	share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
4010	software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
4011	GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
4012	any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
4013	your programs, too.
4014	
4015	  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
4016	price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
4017	have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
4018	them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
4019	want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
4020	free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
4021	
4022	  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
4023	these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
4024	certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
4025	you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
4026	
4027	  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
4028	gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
4029	freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
4030	or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
4031	know their rights.
4032	
4033	  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
4034	(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
4035	giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
4036	
4037	  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
4038	that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
4039	authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
4040	changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
4041	authors of previous versions.
4042	
4043	  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
4044	modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
4045	can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
4046	protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
4047	pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
4048	use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
4049	have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
4050	products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
4051	stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
4052	of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
4053	
4054	  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
4055	States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
4056	software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
4057	avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
4058	make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
4059	patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
4060	
4061	  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
4062	modification follow.
4063	
4064	                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
4065	
4066	  0. Definitions.
4067	
4068	  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
4069	
4070	  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
4071	works, such as semiconductor masks.
4072	
4073	  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
4074	License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
4075	"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
4076	
4077	  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
4078	in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
4079	exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
4080	earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
4081	
4082	  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
4083	on the Program.
4084	
4085	  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
4086	permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
4087	infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
4088	computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
4089	distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
4090	public, and in some countries other activities as well.
4091	
4092	  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
4093	parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
4094	a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
4095	
4096	  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
4097	to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
4098	feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
4099	tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
4100	extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
4101	work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
4102	the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
4103	menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
4104	
4105	  1. Source Code.
4106	
4107	  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
4108	for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
4109	form of a work.
4110	
4111	  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
4112	standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
4113	interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
4114	is widely used among developers working in that language.
4115	
4116	  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
4117	than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
4118	packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
4119	Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
4120	Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
4121	implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
4122	"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
4123	(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
4124	(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
4125	produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
4126	
4127	  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
4128	the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
4129	work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
4130	control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
4131	System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
4132	programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
4133	which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
4134	includes interface definition files associated with source files for
4135	the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
4136	linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
4137	such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
4138	subprograms and other parts of the work.
4139	
4140	  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
4141	can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
4142	Source.
4143	
4144	  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
4145	same work.
4146	
4147	  2. Basic Permissions.
4148	
4149	  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
4150	copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
4151	conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
4152	permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
4153	covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
4154	content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
4155	rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
4156	
4157	  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
4158	convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
4159	in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
4160	of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
4161	with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
4162	the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
4163	not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
4164	for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
4165	and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
4166	your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
4167	
4168	  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
4169	the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
4170	makes it unnecessary.
4171	
4172	  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
4173	
4174	  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
4175	measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
4176	11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
4177	similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
4178	measures.
4179	
4180	  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
4181	circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
4182	is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
4183	the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
4184	modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
4185	users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
4186	technological measures.
4187	
4188	  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
4189	
4190	  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
4191	receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
4192	appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
4193	keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
4194	non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
4195	keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
4196	recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
4197	
4198	  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
4199	and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
4200	
4201	  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
4202	
4203	  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
4204	produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
4205	terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
4206	
4207	    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
4208	    it, and giving a relevant date.
4209	
4210	    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
4211	    released under this License and any conditions added under section
4212	    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
4213	    "keep intact all notices".
4214	
4215	    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
4216	    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
4217	    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
4218	    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
4219	    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
4220	    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
4221	    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
4222	
4223	    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
4224	    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
4225	    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
4226	    work need not make them do so.
4227	
4228	  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
4229	works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
4230	and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
4231	in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
4232	"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
4233	used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
4234	beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
4235	in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
4236	parts of the aggregate.
4237	
4238	  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
4239	
4240	  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
4241	of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
4242	machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
4243	in one of these ways:
4244	
4245	    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
4246	    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
4247	    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
4248	    customarily used for software interchange.
4249	
4250	    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
4251	    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
4252	    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
4253	    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
4254	    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
4255	    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
4256	    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
4257	    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
4258	    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
4259	    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
4260	    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
4261	
4262	    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
4263	    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
4264	    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
4265	    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
4266	    with subsection 6b.
4267	
4268	    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
4269	    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
4270	    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
4271	    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
4272	    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
4273	    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
4274	    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
4275	    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
4276	    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
4277	    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
4278	    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
4279	    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
4280	
4281	    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
4282	    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
4283	    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
4284	    charge under subsection 6d.
4285	
4286	  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
4287	from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
4288	included in conveying the object code work.
4289	
4290	  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
4291	tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
4292	or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
4293	into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
4294	doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
4295	product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
4296	typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
4297	of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
4298	actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
4299	is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
4300	commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
4301	the only significant mode of use of the product.
4302	
4303	  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
4304	procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
4305	and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
4306	a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
4307	suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
4308	code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
4309	modification has been made.
4310	
4311	  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
4312	specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
4313	part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
4314	User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
4315	fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
4316	Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
4317	by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
4318	if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
4319	modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
4320	been installed in ROM).
4321	
4322	  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
4323	requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
4324	for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
4325	the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
4326	network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
4327	adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
4328	protocols for communication across the network.
4329	
4330	  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
4331	in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
4332	documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
4333	source code form), and must require no special password or key for
4334	unpacking, reading or copying.
4335	
4336	  7. Additional Terms.
4337	
4338	  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
4339	License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
4340	Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
4341	be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
4342	that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
4343	apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
4344	under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
4345	this License without regard to the additional permissions.
4346	
4347	  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
4348	remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
4349	it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
4350	removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
4351	additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
4352	for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
4353	
4354	  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
4355	add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
4356	that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
4357	
4358	    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
4359	    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
4360	
4361	    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
4362	    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
4363	    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
4364	
4365	    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
4366	    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
4367	    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
4368	
4369	    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
4370	    authors of the material; or
4371	
4372	    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
4373	    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
4374	
4375	    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
4376	    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
4377	    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
4378	    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
4379	    those licensors and authors.
4380	
4381	  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
4382	restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
4383	received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
4384	governed by this License along with a term that is a further
4385	restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
4386	a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
4387	License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
4388	of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
4389	not survive such relicensing or conveying.
4390	
4391	  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
4392	must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
4393	additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
4394	where to find the applicable terms.
4395	
4396	  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
4397	form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
4398	the above requirements apply either way.
4399	
4400	  8. Termination.
4401	
4402	  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
4403	provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
4404	modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
4405	this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
4406	paragraph of section 11).
4407	
4408	  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
4409	license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
4410	provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
4411	finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
4412	holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
4413	prior to 60 days after the cessation.
4414	
4415	  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
4416	reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
4417	violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
4418	received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
4419	copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
4420	your receipt of the notice.
4421	
4422	  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
4423	licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
4424	this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
4425	reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
4426	material under section 10.
4427	
4428	  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
4429	
4430	  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
4431	run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
4432	occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
4433	to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
4434	nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
4435	modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
4436	not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
4437	covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
4438	
4439	  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
4440	
4441	  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
4442	receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
4443	propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
4444	for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
4445	
4446	  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
4447	organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
4448	organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
4449	work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
4450	transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
4451	licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
4452	give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
4453	Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
4454	the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
4455	
4456	  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
4457	rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
4458	not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
4459	rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
4460	(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
4461	any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
4462	sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
4463	
4464	  11. Patents.
4465	
4466	  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
4467	License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
4468	work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
4469	
4470	  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
4471	owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
4472	hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
4473	by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
4474	but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
4475	consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
4476	purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
4477	patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
4478	this License.
4479	
4480	  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
4481	patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
4482	make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
4483	propagate the contents of its contributor version.
4484	
4485	  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
4486	agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
4487	(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
4488	sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
4489	party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
4490	patent against the party.
4491	
4492	  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
4493	and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
4494	to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
4495	publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
4496	then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
4497	available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
4498	patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
4499	consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
4500	license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
4501	actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
4502	covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
4503	in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
4504	country that you have reason to believe are valid.
4505	
4506	  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
4507	arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
4508	covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
4509	receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
4510	or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
4511	you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
4512	work and works based on it.
4513	
4514	  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
4515	the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
4516	conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
4517	specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
4518	work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
4519	in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
4520	to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
4521	the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
4522	parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
4523	patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
4524	conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
4525	for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
4526	contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
4527	or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
4528	
4529	  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
4530	any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
4531	otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
4532	
4533	  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
4534	
4535	  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
4536	otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
4537	excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
4538	covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
4539	License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
4540	not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
4541	to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
4542	the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
4543	License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
4544	
4545	  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
4546	
4547	  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
4548	permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
4549	under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
4550	combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
4551	License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
4552	but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
4553	section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
4554	combination as such.
4555	
4556	  14. Revised Versions of this License.
4557	
4558	  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
4559	the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
4560	be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
4561	address new problems or concerns.
4562	
4563	  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
4564	Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
4565	Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
4566	option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
4567	version or of any later version published by the Free Software
4568	Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
4569	GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
4570	by the Free Software Foundation.
4571	
4572	  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
4573	versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
4574	public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
4575	to choose that version for the Program.
4576	
4577	  Later license versions may give you additional or different
4578	permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
4579	author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
4580	later version.
4581	
4582	  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
4583	
4584	  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
4585	APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
4586	HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
4587	OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
4588	THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
4589	PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
4590	IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
4591	ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
4592	
4593	  16. Limitation of Liability.
4594	
4595	  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
4596	WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
4597	THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
4598	GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
4599	USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
4600	DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
4601	PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
4602	EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
4603	SUCH DAMAGES.
4604	
4605	  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
4606	
4607	  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
4608	above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
4609	reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
4610	an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
4611	Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
4612	copy of the Program in return for a fee.
4613	
4614	                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
4615	
4616	            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
4617	
4618	  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
4619	possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
4620	free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
4621	
4622	  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
4623	to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
4624	state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
4625	the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
4626	
4627	    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
4628	    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
4629	
4630	    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
4631	    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
4632	    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
4633	    (at your option) any later version.
4634	
4635	    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
4636	    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
4637	    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
4638	    GNU General Public License for more details.
4639	
4640	    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
4641	    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
4642	
4643	Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
4644	
4645	  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
4646	notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
4647	
4648	    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
4649	    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
4650	    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
4651	    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
4652	
4653	The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
4654	parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands
4655	might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".
4656	
4657	  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
4658	if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
4659	For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
4660	<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
4661	
4662	  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
4663	into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
4664	may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with
4665	the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General
4666	Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read
4667	<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.

5202	GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
5203	                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
5204	
5205	 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
5206	 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
5207	 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
5208	
5209	
5210	  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
5211	the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
5212	License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
5213	
5214	  0. Additional Definitions.
5215	
5216	  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
5217	General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
5218	General Public License.
5219	
5220	  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
5221	other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
5222	
5223	  An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
5224	by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
5225	Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
5226	of using an interface provided by the Library.
5227	
5228	  A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
5229	Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
5230	with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
5231	Version".
5232	
5233	  The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
5234	Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
5235	for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
5236	based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
5237	
5238	  The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
5239	object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
5240	and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
5241	Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
5242	
5243	  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
5244	
5245	  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
5246	without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
5247	
5248	  2. Conveying Modified Versions.
5249	
5250	  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
5251	facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
5252	that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
5253	facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
5254	version:
5255	
5256	   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
5257	   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
5258	   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
5259	   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
5260	
5261	   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
5262	   this License applicable to that copy.
5263	
5264	  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
5265	
5266	  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
5267	a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
5268	code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
5269	material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
5270	layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
5271	(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
5272	
5273	   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
5274	   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
5275	   covered by this License.
5276	
5277	   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
5278	   document.
5279	
5280	  4. Combined Works.
5281	
5282	  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
5283	taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
5284	portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
5285	engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
5286	the following:
5287	
5288	   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
5289	   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
5290	   covered by this License.
5291	
5292	   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
5293	   document.
5294	
5295	   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
5296	   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
5297	   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
5298	   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
5299	
5300	   d) Do one of the following:
5301	
5302	       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
5303	       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
5304	       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
5305	       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
5306	       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
5307	       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
5308	       Corresponding Source.
5309	
5310	       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
5311	       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
5312	       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
5313	       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
5314	       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
5315	       Version.
5316	
5317	   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
5318	   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
5319	   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
5320	   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
5321	   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
5322	   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
5323	   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
5324	   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
5325	   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
5326	   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
5327	   for conveying Corresponding Source.)
5328	
5329	  5. Combined Libraries.
5330	
5331	  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
5332	Library side by side in a single library together with other library
5333	facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
5334	License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
5335	choice, if you do both of the following:
5336	
5337	   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
5338	   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
5339	   conveyed under the terms of this License.
5340	
5341	   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
5342	   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
5343	   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
5344	
5345	  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
5346	
5347	  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
5348	of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
5349	versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
5350	differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
5351	
5352	  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
5353	Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
5354	of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
5355	applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
5356	conditions either of that published version or of any later version
5357	published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
5358	received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
5359	General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
5360	General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
5361	
5362	  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
5363	whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
5364	apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
5365	permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
5366	Library.

5382	PREAMBLE
5383	========
5384	
5385	The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL) is the primary license under
5386	which the LaTeX kernel and the base LaTeX packages are distributed.
5387	
5388	You may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright
5389	and which you wish to distribute.  This license may be particularly
5390	suitable if your work is TeX-related (such as a LaTeX package), but
5391	it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is
5392	unrelated to TeX.
5393	
5394	The section `WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE',
5395	below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors
5396	who are considering distributing their works under this license.
5397	
5398	This license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed
5399	and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of
5400	that work may be distributed.
5401	
5402	We, the LaTeX3 Project, believe that the conditions below give you
5403	the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work
5404	that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while
5405	maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of
5406	that work.  If you do not see how to achieve your goal while
5407	meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide.tex'
5408	and `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution for suggestions.
5409	
5410	
5411	DEFINITIONS
5412	===========
5413	
5414	In this license document the following terms are used:
5415	
5416	   `Work'
5417	    Any work being distributed under this License.
5418	
5419	   `Derived Work'
5420	    Any work that under any applicable law is derived from the Work.
5421	
5422	   `Modification'
5423	    Any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any applicable
5424	    law -- for example, the production of a file containing an
5425	    original file associated with the Work or a significant portion of
5426	    such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
5427	    translated into another language.
5428	
5429	   `Modify'
5430	    To apply any procedure that produces a Derived Work under any
5431	    applicable law.
5432	
5433	   `Distribution'
5434	    Making copies of the Work available from one person to another, in
5435	    whole or in part.  Distribution includes (but is not limited to)
5436	    making any electronic components of the Work accessible by
5437	    file transfer protocols such as FTP or HTTP or by shared file
5438	    systems such as Sun's Network File System (NFS).
5439	
5440	   `Compiled Work'
5441	    A version of the Work that has been processed into a form where it
5442	    is directly usable on a computer system.  This processing may
5443	    include using installation facilities provided by the Work,
5444	    transformations of the Work, copying of components of the Work, or
5445	    other activities.  Note that modification of any installation
5446	    facilities provided by the Work constitutes modification of the Work.
5447	
5448	   `Current Maintainer'
5449	    A person or persons nominated as such within the Work.  If there is
5450	    no such explicit nomination then it is the `Copyright Holder' under
5451	    any applicable law.
5452	
5453	   `Base Interpreter'
5454	    A program or process that is normally needed for running or
5455	    interpreting a part or the whole of the Work.
5456	
5457	    A Base Interpreter may depend on external components but these
5458	    are not considered part of the Base Interpreter provided that each
5459	    external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used
5460	    interactively.  Unless explicitly specified when applying the
5461	    license to the Work, the only applicable Base Interpreter is a
5462	    `LaTeX-Format' or in the case of files belonging to the
5463	    `LaTeX-format' a program implementing the `TeX language'.
5464	
5465	
5466	
5467	CONDITIONS ON DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
5468	===========================================
5469	
5470	1.  Activities other than distribution and/or modification of the Work
5471	are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope.  In
5472	particular, the act of running the Work is not restricted and no
5473	requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the Work.
5474	
5475	2.  You may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the Work as you
5476	received it.  Distribution of only part of the Work is considered
5477	modification of the Work, and no right to distribute such a Derived
5478	Work may be assumed under the terms of this clause.
5479	
5480	3.  You may distribute a Compiled Work that has been generated from a
5481	complete, unmodified copy of the Work as distributed under Clause 2
5482	above, as long as that Compiled Work is distributed in such a way that
5483	the recipients may install the Compiled Work on their system exactly
5484	as it would have been installed if they generated a Compiled Work
5485	directly from the Work.
5486	
5487	4.  If you are the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may, without
5488	restriction, modify the Work, thus creating a Derived Work.  You may
5489	also distribute the Derived Work without restriction, including
5490	Compiled Works generated from the Derived Work.  Derived Works
5491	distributed in this manner by the Current Maintainer are considered to
5492	be updated versions of the Work.
5493	
5494	5.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may modify
5495	your copy of the Work, thus creating a Derived Work based on the Work,
5496	and compile this Derived Work, thus creating a Compiled Work based on
5497	the Derived Work.
5498	
5499	6.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
5500	distribute a Derived Work provided the following conditions are met
5501	for every component of the Work unless that component clearly states
5502	in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition.  Only
5503	the Current Maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption
5504	to a component of the Work.
5505	
5506	  a. If a component of this Derived Work can be a direct replacement
5507	     for a component of the Work when that component is used with the
5508	     Base Interpreter, then, wherever this component of the Work
5509	     identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that
5510	     Base Interpreter, the replacement component of this Derived Work
5511	     clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version
5512	     of this component to the user when used interactively with that
5513	     Base Interpreter.
5514	
5515	  b. Every component of the Derived Work contains prominent notices
5516	     detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a
5517	     prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part
5518	     of the Derived Work and that contains a complete and accurate log
5519	     of the changes.
5520	
5521	  c. No information in the Derived Work implies that any persons,
5522	     including (but not limited to) the authors of the original version
5523	     of the Work, provide any support, including (but not limited to)
5524	     the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the
5525	     Derived Work unless those persons have stated explicitly that
5526	     they do provide such support for the Derived Work.
5527	
5528	  d. You distribute at least one of the following with the Derived Work:
5529	
5530	       1. A complete, unmodified copy of the Work;
5531	          if your distribution of a modified component is made by
5532	          offering access to copy the modified component from a
5533	          designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
5534	          the Work from the same or some similar place meets this
5535	          condition, even though third parties are not compelled to
5536	          copy the Work along with the modified component;
5537	
5538	       2. Information that is sufficient to obtain a complete,
5539	          unmodified copy of the Work.
5540	
5541	7.  If you are not the Current Maintainer of the Work, you may
5542	distribute a Compiled Work generated from a Derived Work, as long as
5543	the Derived Work is distributed to all recipients of the Compiled
5544	Work, and as long as the conditions of Clause 6, above, are met with
5545	regard to the Derived Work.
5546	
5547	8.  The conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not
5548	apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it
5549	becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the Work as
5550	it is distributed by the Current Maintainer under Clause 4, above.
5551	
5552	9.  Distribution of the Work or any Derived Work in an alternative
5553	format, where the Work or that Derived Work (in whole or in part) is
5554	then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or
5555	nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of
5556	applying that process.
5557	
5558	10. a. A Derived Work may be distributed under a different license
5559	       provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in
5560	       Clause 6 above, in regard to the Work, though it does not have
5561	       to honor the rest of the conditions in this license.
5562	
5563	    b. If a Derived Work is distributed under a different license, that
5564	       Derived Work must provide sufficient documentation as part of
5565	       itself to allow each recipient of that Derived Work to honor the
5566	       restrictions in Clause 6 above, concerning changes from the Work.
5567	
5568	11. This license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to
5569	the Work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating
5570	such works with the Work by any means.
5571	
5572	12.  Nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent
5573	complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws.
5574	
5575	
5576	NO WARRANTY
5577	===========
5578	
5579	There is no warranty for the Work.  Except when otherwise stated in
5580	writing, the Copyright Holder provides the Work `as is', without
5581	warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
5582	limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a
5583	particular purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance
5584	of the Work is with you.  Should the Work prove defective, you assume
5585	the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.
5586	
5587	In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
5588	will The Copyright Holder, or any author named in the components of the
5589	Work, or any other party who may distribute and/or modify the Work as
5590	permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general,
5591	special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of
5592	the Work or out of inability to use the Work (including, but not limited
5593	to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by
5594	anyone as a result of any failure of the Work to operate with any other
5595	programs), even if the Copyright Holder or said author or said other
5596	party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
5597	
5598	
5599	MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK
5600	=======================
5601	
5602	The Work has the status `author-maintained' if the Copyright Holder
5603	explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in
5604	the Work that the Work can only be maintained by the Copyright Holder
5605	or simply that it is `author-maintained'.
5606	
5607	The Work has the status `maintained' if there is a Current Maintainer
5608	who has indicated in the Work that they are willing to receive error
5609	reports for the Work (for example, by supplying a valid e-mail
5610	address). It is not required for the Current Maintainer to acknowledge
5611	or act upon these error reports.
5612	
5613	The Work changes from status `maintained' to `unmaintained' if there
5614	is no Current Maintainer, or the person stated to be Current
5615	Maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means
5616	of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other
5617	significant signs of active maintenance.
5618	
5619	You can become the Current Maintainer of the Work by agreement with
5620	any existing Current Maintainer to take over this role.
5621	
5622	If the Work is unmaintained, you can become the Current Maintainer of
5623	the Work through the following steps:
5624	
5625	 1.  Make a reasonable attempt to trace the Current Maintainer (and
5626	     the Copyright Holder, if the two differ) through the means of
5627	     an Internet or similar search.
5628	
5629	 2.  If this search is successful, then enquire whether the Work
5630	     is still maintained.
5631	
5632	  a. If it is being maintained, then ask the Current Maintainer
5633	     to update their communication data within one month.
5634	
5635	  b. If the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active
5636	     maintenance is taken by the Current Maintainer, then announce
5637	     within the pertinent community your intention to take over
5638	     maintenance.  (If the Work is a LaTeX work, this could be
5639	     done, for example, by posting to comp.text.tex.)
5640	
5641	 3a. If the Current Maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass
5642	     maintenance of the Work to you, then this takes effect
5643	     immediately upon announcement.
5644	
5645	  b. If the Current Maintainer is not reachable and the Copyright
5646	     Holder agrees that maintenance of the Work be passed to you,
5647	     then this takes effect immediately upon announcement.
5648	
5649	 4.  If you make an `intention announcement' as described in 2b. above
5650	     and after three months your intention is challenged neither by
5651	     the Current Maintainer nor by the Copyright Holder nor by other
5652	     people, then you may arrange for the Work to be changed so as
5653	     to name you as the (new) Current Maintainer.
5654	
5655	 5.  If the previously unreachable Current Maintainer becomes
5656	     reachable once more within three months of a change completed
5657	     under the terms of 3b) or 4), then that Current Maintainer must
5658	     become or remain the Current Maintainer upon request provided
5659	     they then update their communication data within one month.
5660	
5661	A change in the Current Maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact
5662	that the Work is distributed under the LPPL license.
5663	
5664	If you become the Current Maintainer of the Work, you should
5665	immediately provide, within the Work, a prominent and unambiguous
5666	statement of your status as Current Maintainer.  You should also
5667	announce your new status to the same pertinent community as
5668	in 2b) above.
5669	
5670	
5671	WHETHER AND HOW TO DISTRIBUTE WORKS UNDER THIS LICENSE
5672	======================================================
5673	
5674	This section contains important instructions, examples, and
5675	recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their
5676	works under this license.  These authors are addressed as `you' in
5677	this section.
5678	
5679	Choosing This License or Another License
5680	----------------------------------------
5681	
5682	If for any part of your work you want or need to use *distribution*
5683	conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then
5684	do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead,
5685	distribute your work under a different license.  You may use the text
5686	of this license as a model for your own license, but your license
5687	should not refer to the LPPL or otherwise give the impression that
5688	your work is distributed under the LPPL.
5689	
5690	The document `modguide.tex' in the base LaTeX distribution explains
5691	the motivation behind the conditions of this license.  It explains,
5692	for example, why distributing LaTeX under the GNU General Public
5693	License (GPL) was considered inappropriate.  Even if your work is
5694	unrelated to LaTeX, the discussion in `modguide.tex' may still be
5695	relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any
5696	license are encouraged to read it.
5697	
5698	A Recommendation on Modification Without Distribution
5699	-----------------------------------------------------
5700	
5701	It is wise never to modify a component of the Work, even for your own
5702	personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for
5703	distributing the modified component.  While you might intend that such
5704	modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by
5705	accident -- you may forget that you have modified that component; or
5706	it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified
5707	version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions
5708	of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse,
5709	cause problems for the community.  It is therefore usually in your
5710	best interest to keep your copy of the Work identical with the public
5711	one.  Many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work
5712	without altering any of its licensed components.
5713	
5714	How to Use This License
5715	-----------------------
5716	
5717	To use this license, place in each of the components of your work both
5718	an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work
5719	was authored and/or last substantially modified.  Include also a
5720	statement that the distribution and/or modification of that
5721	component is constrained by the conditions in this license.
5722	
5723	Here is an example of such a notice and statement:
5724	
5725	  %% pig.dtx
5726	  %% Copyright 2005 M. Y. Name
5727	  %
5728	  % This work may be distributed and/or modified under the
5729	  % conditions of the LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3
5730	  % of this license or (at your option) any later version.
5731	  % The latest version of this license is in
5732	  %   http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt
5733	  % and version 1.3 or later is part of all distributions of LaTeX
5734	  % version 2005/12/01 or later.
5735	  %
5736	  % This work has the LPPL maintenance status `maintained'.
5737	  %
5738	  % The Current Maintainer of this work is M. Y. Name.
5739	  %
5740	  % This work consists of the files pig.dtx and pig.ins
5741	  % and the derived file pig.sty.
5742	
5743	Given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions
5744	given in this license document would apply, with the `Work' referring
5745	to the three files `pig.dtx', `pig.ins', and `pig.sty' (the last being
5746	generated from `pig.dtx' using `pig.ins'), the `Base Interpreter'
5747	referring to any `LaTeX-Format', and both `Copyright Holder' and
5748	`Current Maintainer' referring to the person `M. Y. Name'.
5749	
5750	If you do not want the Maintenance section of LPPL to apply to your
5751	Work, change `maintained' above into `author-maintained'.
5752	However, we recommend that you use `maintained', as the Maintenance
5753	section was added in order to ensure that your Work remains useful to
5754	the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it
5755	yourself.
5756	
5757	Derived Works That Are Not Replacements
5758	---------------------------------------
5759	
5760	Several clauses of the LPPL specify means to provide reliability and
5761	stability for the user community. They therefore concern themselves
5762	with the case that a Derived Work is intended to be used as a
5763	(compatible or incompatible) replacement of the original Work. If
5764	this is not the case (e.g., if a few lines of code are reused for a
5765	completely different task), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply.
5766	
5767	
5768	Important Recommendations
5769	-------------------------
5770	
5771	 Defining What Constitutes the Work
5772	
5773	   The LPPL requires that distributions of the Work contain all the
5774	   files of the Work.  It is therefore important that you provide a
5775	   way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the Work.
5776	   This could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the
5777	   files of the Work near the copyright notice of each file or by
5778	   using a line such as:
5779	
5780	    % This work consists of all files listed in manifest.txt.
5781	
5782	   in that place.  In the absence of an unequivocal list it might be
5783	   impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you
5784	   to comprise the Work and, in such a case, the licensee would be
5785	   entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise
5786	   the Work.

5908	Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
5909	non-exclusive license:
5910	
5911	(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
5912	    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,
5913	    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its
5914	    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or
5915	    as part of a Larger Work; and
5916	
5917	(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer
5918	    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its
5919	    Contributions or its Contributor Version.
5920	
5921	2.2. Effective Date
5922	
5923	The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution
5924	become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first
5925	distributes such Contribution.
5926	
5927	2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
5928	
5929	The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
5930	this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
5931	distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
5932	Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a
5933	Contributor:
5934	
5935	(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
5936	    or
5937	
5938	(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
5939	    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
5940	    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
5941	    Version); or
5942	
5943	(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
5944	    its Contributions.
5945	
5946	This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
5947	or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with
5948	the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
5949	
5950	2.4. Subsequent Licenses
5951	
5952	No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
5953	distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
5954	License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
5955	permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
5956	
5957	2.5. Representation
5958	
5959	Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
5960	Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights
5961	to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.
5962	
5963	2.6. Fair Use
5964	
5965	This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
5966	applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other
5967	equivalents.
5968	
5969	2.7. Conditions
5970	
5971	Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted
5972	in Section 2.1.
5973	
5974	3. Responsibilities
5975	-------------------
5976	
5977	3.1. Distribution of Source Form
5978	
5979	All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
5980	Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
5981	the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
5982	Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
5983	License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
5984	attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
5985	Form.
5986	
5987	3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
5988	
5989	If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
5990	
5991	(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
5992	    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
5993	    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
5994	    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
5995	    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
5996	
5997	(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
5998	    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
5999	    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
6000	    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
6001	
6002	3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
6003	
6004	You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
6005	provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
6006	the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
6007	Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
6008	Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
6009	License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
6010	under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
6011	the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
6012	Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
6013	License(s).
6014	
6015	3.4. Notices
6016	
6017	You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
6018	(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
6019	or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
6020	the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
6021	the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
6022	
6023	3.5. Application of Additional Terms
6024	
6025	You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
6026	indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
6027	Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
6028	behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
6029	such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
6030	You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
6031	liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
6032	indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
6033	disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
6034	jurisdiction.
6035	
6036	4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
6037	---------------------------------------------------
6038	
6039	If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
6040	License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
6041	statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
6042	the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
6043	describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
6044	be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
6045	Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
6046	or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
6047	recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
6048	
6049	5. Termination
6050	--------------
6051	
6052	5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
6053	if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
6054	compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
6055	Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
6056	Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
6057	ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
6058	non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
6059	come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
6060	Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
6061	notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
6062	first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
6063	from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
6064	Your receipt of the notice.
6065	
6066	5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
6067	infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
6068	counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
6069	directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
6070	You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
6071	2.1 of this License shall terminate.
6072	
6073	5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
6074	end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
6075	have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
6076	prior to termination shall survive termination.

6342	
6343	This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

6348	SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
6349	-----------------------------------------------------------
6350	
6351	PREAMBLE
6352	The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
6353	development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
6354	efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
6355	open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
6356	with others.
6357	
6358	The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
6359	redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
6360	fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
6361	redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
6362	names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
6363	however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
6364	requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
6365	to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
6366	
6367	DEFINITIONS

6377	
6378	"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,

6381	new environment.
6382	
6383	"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
6384	writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

6399	in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
6400	binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
6401	
6402	3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
6403	Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
6404	Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
6405	presented to the users.
6406	
6407	4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
6408	Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any

6410	Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written
6411	permission.
6412	
6413	5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
6414	must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be
