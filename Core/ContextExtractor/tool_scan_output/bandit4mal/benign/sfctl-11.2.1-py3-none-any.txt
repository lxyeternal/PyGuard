32	          short-summary: The maximum amount of time to wait
33	            for all cluster entities to become stable and healthy.
34	          long-summary: Chaos executes in iterations and at the start of
35	            each iteration it validates the health of cluster entities.
36	            During validation if a cluster entity is not stable and healthy
37	            within MaxClusterStabilizationTimeoutInSeconds,
38	            Chaos generates a validation failed event.
39	        - name: --max-concurrent-faults
40	          type: int
41	          short-summary: The maximum number of concurrent faults induced
42	            per iteration. Chaos executes in iterations and two consecutive
43	            iterations are separated by a validation phase. The higher
44	            the concurrency, the more aggressive the injection of
45	            faults -- inducing more complex series of states to uncover bugs.
46	            The recommendation is to start with a value of 2 or 3 and to
47	            exercise caution while moving up.

54	            within a single iteration.
55	          long-summary: The larger the value, the lower the overlapping
56	            between faults and the simpler the sequence of state transitions
57	            that the cluster goes through. The recommendation is to start
58	            with a value between 1 and 5 and exercise caution while moving up.
59	        - name: --wait-time-between-iterations
60	          type: int
61	          short-summary: Time-separation (in seconds) between two consecutive
62	            iterations of Chaos. The larger the value, the lower the fault
63	            injection rate.
64	        - name: --max-percent-unhealthy-nodes
65	          type: int
66	          short-summary: When evaluating cluster health during Chaos, the
67	            maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes before
68	            reporting an error.
69	          long-summary: The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy nodes
70	            before reporting an error. For example, to allow 10% of nodes
71	            to be unhealthy, this value would be 10. The percentage represents
72	            the maximum tolerated percentage of nodes that can be unhealthy
73	            before the cluster is considered in error. If the percentage is
74	            respected but there is at least one unhealthy node, the health
75	            is evaluated as Warning. The percentage is calculated by dividing
76	            the number of unhealthy nodes over the total number of nodes
77	            in the cluster. The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure
78	            on small numbers of nodes. Default percentage is zero.
79	            In large clusters, some nodes will always be down or out for
80	            repairs, so this percentage should be configured to tolerate that.
81	        - name: --max-percent-unhealthy-apps
82	          type: int
83	          short-summary: When evaluating cluster health during Chaos,
84	            the maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy applications
85	            before reporting an error.
86	          long-summary: The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy
87	            applications before reporting an error. For example,
88	            to allow 10% of applications to be unhealthy, this value would be 10.
89	            The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage
90	            of applications that can be unhealthy before the cluster is
91	            considered in error. If the percentage is respected but
92	            there is at least one unhealthy application, the health
93	            is evaluated as Warning. This is calculated by dividing
94	            the number of unhealthy applications over the total number
95	            of application instances in the cluster, excluding applications
96	            of application types that are included in the
97	            ApplicationTypeHealthPolicyMap. The computation rounds up
98	            to tolerate one failure on small numbers of applications.
99	            Default percentage is zero.
100	        - name: --app-type-health-policy-map
101	          type: string
102	          short-summary: JSON encoded list with max
103	            percentage unhealthy applications for specific application
104	            types. Each entry specifies as a key the application type
105	            name and as  a value an integer that represents the
106	            MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications percentage used to evaluate
107	            the applications of the specified application type.
108	          long-summary: Defines a map with max percentage unhealthy
109	            applications for specific application types. Each entry
110	            specifies as key the application type name and as value
111	            an integer that represents the MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications
112	            percentage used to evaluate the applications of the specified
113	            application type. The application type health policy map
114	            can be used during cluster health evaluation to describe
115	            special application types. The application types included
116	            in the map are evaluated against the percentage specified
117	            in the map, and not with the global MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications
118	            defined in the cluster health policy. The applications of
119	            application types specified in the map are not counted against
120	            the global pool of applications. For example, if some
121	            applications of a type are critical, the cluster administrator
122	            can add an entry to the map for that application type and assign
123	            it a value of 0% (that is, do not tolerate any failures).
124	            All other applications can be evaluated with
125	            MaxPercentUnhealthyApplications set to 20% to tolerate
126	            some failures out of the thousands of application instances.
127	            The application type health policy map is used only if the
128	            cluster manifest enables application type health evaluation
129	            using the configuration entry for
130	            HealthManager/EnableApplicationTypeHealthEvaluation.
131	        - name: --context
132	          type: string
133	          short-summary: JSON encoded map of (string, string) type key-value
134	            pairs. The map can be used to record information about the Chaos
135	            run. There cannot be more than 100 such pairs and each
136	            string (key or value) can be at most 4095 characters long.
137	            This map is set by the starter of the Chaos run to optionally
138	            store the context about the specific run.
139	        - name: --chaos-target-filter
140	          type: string
141	          short-summary: JSON encoded dictionary with two
142	            string type keys. The two keys are NodeTypeInclusionList and
143	            ApplicationInclusionList. Values for both of these keys are list of
144	            string. chaos_target_filter defines all filters for targeted
145	            Chaos faults, for example, faulting only certain node types or
146	            faulting only certain applications.
147	          long-summary: If chaos_target_filter is not used, Chaos faults all cluster entities.
148	            If chaos_target_filter is used, Chaos faults only the entities that
149	            meet the chaos_target_filter specification. NodeTypeInclusionList
150	            and ApplicationInclusionList allow a union semantics only. It is
151	            not possible to specify an intersection of NodeTypeInclusionList
152	            and ApplicationInclusionList. For example,
153	            it is not possible to specify "fault this application only when
154	            it is on that node type." Once an entity is included in either
155	            NodeTypeInclusionList or ApplicationInclusionList, that entity cannot
156	            be excluded using ChaosTargetFilter. Even if applicationX does not
157	            appear in ApplicationInclusionList, in some Chaos iteration
158	            applicationX can be faulted because it happens to be on a node of
159	            nodeTypeY that is included in NodeTypeInclusionList.
160	            If both NodeTypeInclusionList and ApplicationInclusionList
161	            are empty, an ArgumentException is thrown.
162	            All types of faults (restart node, restart code package, remove replica,
163	            restart replica, move primary, and move secondary) are enabled for
164	            the nodes of these node types.
165	            If a node type (say NodeTypeX) does not appear in the
166	            NodeTypeInclusionList, then node level faults (like NodeRestart)
167	            will never be enabled for the nodes of NodeTypeX, but code package
168	            and replica faults can still be enabled for NodeTypeX
169	            if an application in the ApplicationInclusionList happens to
170	            reside on a node of NodeTypeX.
171	            At most 100 node type names can be included in this list,
172	            to increase this number, a config upgrade is required for
173	            MaxNumberOfNodeTypesInChaosEntityFilter configuration.
174	            All replicas belonging to services of these applications are
175	            amenable to replica faults (restart replica, remove replica,
176	            move primary, and move secondary) by Chaos.
177	            Chaos may restart a code package only if the code package hosts
178	            replicas of these applications only.
179	            If an application does not appear in this list, it can still
180	            be faulted in some Chaos iteration if the application ends
181	            up on a node of a node type that is included in NodeTypeInclusionList.
182	            However if applicationX is tied to nodeTypeY through placement
183	            constraints and applicationX is absent from ApplicationInclusionList
184	            and nodeTypeY is absent from NodeTypeInclusionList, then
185	            applicationX will never be faulted. At most 1000 application
186	            names can be included in this list, to increase this number,
187	            a config upgrade is required for
188	            MaxNumberOfApplicationsInChaosEntityFilter configuration.
