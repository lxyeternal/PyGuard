8	This module provides fast hierarchical clustering routines. The "linkage"
9	method is designed to provide a replacement for the “linkage” function and
10	its siblings in the scipy.cluster.hierarchy module. You may use the methods
11	in this module with the same syntax as the corresponding SciPy functions but
12	with the benefit of much faster performance.
13	
14	The method "linkage_vector" performs clustering of vector data with memory-
15	saving algorithms.

28	      description='Fast hierarchical clustering routines for R and Python.',
29	      long_description=u"""
30	This library provides Python functions for hierarchical clustering. It
31	generates hierarchical clusters from distance matrices or from vector data.
32	
33	This module is intended to replace the functions
34	```
35	    linkage, single, complete, average, weighted, centroid, median, ward
36	```
37	in the module [`scipy.cluster.hierarchy`](
38	https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/cluster.hierarchy.html) with the same
39	functionality but much faster algorithms. Moreover, the function
40	`linkage_vector` provides memory-efficient clustering for vector data.
41	
42	The interface is very similar to MATLAB's Statistics Toolbox API to make code
43	easier to port from MATLAB to Python/NumPy. The core implementation of this
44	library is in C++ for efficiency.
45	
46	**User manual:** [fastcluster.pdf](
47	https://github.com/dmuellner/fastcluster/raw/master/docs/fastcluster.pdf).
48	
49	The “Yule” distance function changed in fastcluster version 1.2.0. This is
50	following a [change in SciPy 1.6.3](
51	https://github.com/scipy/scipy/commit/3b22d1da98dc1b5f64bc944c21f398d4ba782bce).
52	It is recommended to use fastcluster version 1.1.x together with SciPy versions
53	before 1.6.3 and fastcluster 1.2.x with SciPy ≥1.6.3.
54	
55	The fastcluster package is considered stable and will undergo few changes
56	from now on. If some years from now there have not been any updates, this does
57	not necessarily mean that the package is unmaintained but maybe it just was
58	not necessary to correct anything. Of course, please still report potential
59	bugs and incompatibilities to daniel@danifold.net. You may also use
60	[my GitHub repository](https://github.com/dmuellner/fastcluster/)
61	for bug reports, pull requests etc.
62	
63	Note that [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fastcluster/) and [my GitHub
64	repository](https://github.com/dmuellner/fastcluster/) host the source code
65	for the Python interface only. The archive with both the R and the Python
66	interface is available on
67	[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=fastcluster) and the GitHub repository
68	[“cran/fastcluster”](https://github.com/cran/fastcluster). Even though I appear
69	as the author also of this second GitHub repository, this is just an automatic,
70	read-only mirror of the CRAN archive, so please do not attempt to report bugs or
71	contact me via this repository.
72	
73	Installation files for Windows are provided on [PyPI](
74	https://pypi.org/project/fastcluster/#files) and on [Christoph Gohlke's web
75	page](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#fastcluster).
76	
77	Christoph Dalitz wrote a pure [C++ interface to fastcluster](
78	https://lionel.kr.hs-niederrhein.de/~dalitz/data/hclust/).
