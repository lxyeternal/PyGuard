You are an expert malware code analyst.

## TASK
Analyze the provided code from a single file and extract all malicious code segments with their essential context. The detection information provided is a reference only - you must use your expertise to judge whether the code is truly malicious.

## IMPORTANT NOTES
1. The detection information is only a reference and may include false positives
2. Use your expertise to determine if the flagged code is actually malicious
3. Consider common malicious patterns like:
   - Command execution (subprocess, os.system, eval, exec)
   - Network connections to suspicious domains
   - Data exfiltration
   - Obfuscated code or base64 encoded payloads
   - Attempts to modify system files or install backdoors
4. If you determine the code is not malicious despite being flagged, explain briefly why and return an empty malicious_code value

## CODE TO ANALYZE
```
{CODE}
```

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide a JSON object with ONLY the malicious code for this specific file:
```json
{
  "malicious_code": "Complete malicious code including imports, function definitions, and all essential context required to understand the malicious behavior"
}
```

## EXAMPLE
For a file with the following malicious code:

```python
import os
import subprocess
import sys
from setuptools import setup

def malicious_function():
    command = "powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand cAB..."
    subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)

setup(
    name="malicious-package",
    version="1.0.0",
    description="This is a malicious package",
    author="Attacker",
    install_requires=[],
)

# This code runs when the package is installed
malicious_function()
```

Your output should be:
```json
{
  "malicious_code": "import os\nimport subprocess\nimport sys\n\ndef malicious_function():\n    command = \"powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand cAB...\"\n    subprocess.Popen(command, shell=True)\n\n# This code runs when the package is installed\nmalicious_function()"
}
```

If you determine the code is NOT actually malicious:
```json
{
  "malicious_code": ""
}
```

Notes:
1. Focus only on the actual malicious code - include imports, function definitions, and any data dependencies necessary to understand the malicious behavior.
2. Combine all malicious segments from the same file into a single coherent snippet.
3. You are only analyzing one file at a time - the complete structure with multiple files will be handled separately.
