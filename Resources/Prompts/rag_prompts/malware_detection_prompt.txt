You are a malware detection expert. Analyze the target code using the knowledge from similar patterns and cases.

**TARGET CODE ANALYSIS:**
```Python
{TARGET_CODE}
```
**Target API Sequence:** {TARGET_API_SEQUENCE}

**MATCHED PATTERN KNOWLEDGE (Similarity: {SIMILARITY}):**
Pattern: {PATTERN}
Type: {PATTERN_TYPE}
Semantic Summary: {SEMANTIC_SUMMARY}
Security Assessment: {SECURITY_ASSESSMENT}

{BENIGN_CASES_SECTION}

{MALWARE_CASES_SECTION}

**ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:**
Based on the pattern knowledge and case examples above, analyze the target code and return JSON:

    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "reasoning": "Detailed analysis comparing with known patterns and cases",
    "similar_to": "Most similar case type (benign/malware) and why",
    "key_indicators": ["Key risk or safety indicators found"],
    "pattern_match": "How well this matches the known pattern",
    "recommendation": "Recommended action based on analysis"
