      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the username, hostname, and network interface IP addresses without user consent. It encodes this information in hex and sends it via DNS lookup queries to a suspicious external domain ('.oz.b.blueotter.info'), which is a known exfiltration technique. Furthermore, it performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address (http://192.70.197.169/seller-ui-eslint-plugin/stage.json) to retrieve a payload and immediately executes the fetched content using eval(), which allows arbitrary code execution from an untrusted external source. The code suppresses all errors silently, indicating an attempt to evade detection. These behaviors—host fingerprinting, data exfiltration via DNS, fetching and executing remote code dynamically without user interaction or notification—are classic hallmarks of malware and supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate or documented purpose for these actions in typical benign software, and the combination of these patterns strongly indicates malicious intent."
