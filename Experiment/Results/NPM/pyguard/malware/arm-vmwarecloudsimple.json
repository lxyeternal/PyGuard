      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and recursively enumerates files from root directories (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently, uses multiple heuristics to exclude certain environments, and performs DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from system data, likely for tracking or fingerprinting. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns, as it profiles the host environment and exfiltrates sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, and the network communication is to a suspicious, non-standard domain. The combination of gathering sensitive environment data, enumerating files from system root directories, encoding this data, and exfiltrating it stealthily to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
