It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (a pipedream.net URL), which is a known service often used for capturing exfiltrated data in testing or malicious contexts. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic explaining this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering host-specific and user-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded URL without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
