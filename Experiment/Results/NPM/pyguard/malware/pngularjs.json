It then serializes this information into a string and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is suspicious and commonly observed in malware. The code runs automatically (immediately invoked async function) upon import or execution, with no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling to indicate benign intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an external server, making it highly likely to be malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Additionally, the package name 'pngularjs' and repository URL 'AngulerJS' appear to be typos or attempts to mimic popular packages (like AngularJS), which is a common tactic in dependency confusion or typosquatting attacks. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further suggests this package is designed to exploit such vulnerabilities."
