      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication immediately upon module execution. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and file system information, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The code's behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including host fingerprinting, stealthy data exfiltration, and communication with an attacker-controlled server. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has a very high version number (99.10.9) and a vague description ('azure package') with no author information, which are common signs of a potentially malicious or typosquatting package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a red flag."
