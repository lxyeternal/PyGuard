      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a network socket and connects to a hardcoded external IP address (207.154.222.173) on port 4444, then spawns a shell process (/bin/sh) and pipes the shell's input and output to the network socket. This is a classic reverse shell pattern, which allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling, and the code runs immediately upon loading. The use of a hardcoded IP and port, direct spawning of a shell, and piping of stdin/stdout over the network are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware and is a critical risk indicator of unauthorized remote control and system compromise."
