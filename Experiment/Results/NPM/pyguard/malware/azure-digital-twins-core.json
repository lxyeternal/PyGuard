      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata without any user consent or notification. It encodes this data in hexadecimal and constructs DNS query names targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, likely to signal or exfiltrate data covertly. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server, use of hardcoded suspicious domains, lack of user interaction or consent, and stealthy network communication patterns. Therefore, this code is malicious and is designed to perform unauthorized reconnaissance and exfiltration of sensitive system information."
