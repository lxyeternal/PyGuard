It then sends this sensitive and comprehensive system fingerprint data via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (enjglpdgtgrbn4b.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The endpoint path is base64-encoded, indicating an attempt to obfuscate the destination URL. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code: automated data exfiltration of sensitive system information, use of obfuscation (base64 encoding of environment data and URL path), hardcoded suspicious external endpoint, no legitimate user-facing functionality, and no error handling or logging to inform the user. The code does not perform any benign or documented purpose and appears solely designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate host environment data, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code without user consent. Additionally, the dependencies include 'http', 'https', and 'os' packages from npm, which are not the standard Node.js built-in modules but third-party packages with those names. These packages are known to be deprecated or security placeholder packages and can be used to inject malicious code. The combination of executing a script on preinstall and suspicious dependencies indicates potential malicious behavior."
