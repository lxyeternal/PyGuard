      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, and the current user. It also appends a fixed string ('jupiter-i18n') and fetches the public IP address via a curl request to https://ifconfig.me. This collected data is then hex-encoded using 'xxd -p' and exfiltrated via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://eozpdddh3tifjo.m.pipedream.net). The use of 'exec' to run this combined shell command without any user interaction or notification, the collection of system and user information, and the transmission of this data to an external, suspicious endpoint are classic indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as automated data exfiltration, host fingerprinting, and communication with attacker-controlled servers without consent. There is no legitimate or documented purpose for this data collection and exfiltration, making this code highly suspicious and malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This script executes before installation and suppresses all output, which is a common tactic to hide malicious activity. Additionally, the description states it is a 'proof of concept for dependency confusion', indicating it is designed to exploit dependency resolution mechanisms. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a hidden preinstall script strongly suggests malicious intent."
