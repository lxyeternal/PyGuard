      "malicious_behavior": "The postinstall script runs 'node postinstall.js' and then executes a binary './bin/run/run', followed by removing the './bin' directory. This behavior is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation and then deletes the evidence (the './bin' directory). Without the source code of 'postinstall.js' and the binary './bin/run/run', it is impossible to verify what actions are performed, but this pattern is commonly used to hide malicious payloads or actions. Additionally, the removal of the './bin' directory immediately after execution suggests an attempt to cover tracks."
