      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and custom formats, constructs DNS queries with this encoded data, and performs DNS lookups to a suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). It then sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and uses multiple heuristics to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. The data exfiltration to a hardcoded, non-standard domain combined with host fingerprinting and directory enumeration is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior, and the network communication is stealthy and unsolicited. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware."
