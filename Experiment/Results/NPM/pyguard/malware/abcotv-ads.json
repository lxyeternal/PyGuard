      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a hardcoded external IP address (http://77.244.210.247/burpcollaborator.txt) without user consent, saves it locally, reads its first line to extract a hostname and port, then collects sensitive system information including package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package metadata. It serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to the extracted external host and port. This sequence of automated data collection and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server, combined with the use of a suspicious hardcoded IP and domain name (burpcollaborator.net is a known testing domain often used for detecting external interactions), and the absence of any user interaction, error logging, or legitimate purpose, strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The code runs immediately upon import/execution without user consent or notification, further confirming its malicious intent."

It collects sensitive system information including package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package metadata. This information is serialized and sent via an HTTPS POST request to the extracted external host and port. The code runs automatically without any user interaction or notification. The use of a hardcoded suspicious IP, collection of sensitive environment and user data, and exfiltration to an external server without consent are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and error handling suppresses network errors, indicating stealth. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting and unauthorized data exfiltration."

It serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to the extracted external host and port. This sequence of actions—automated retrieval of remote content, collection of host-specific and user-sensitive information, and exfiltration to an external server without user interaction or notification—is a classic pattern of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded IP and the domain name 'burpcollaborator' (commonly used in security testing but suspicious in production code) further indicates intent to communicate with an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling, and the code runs automatically upon import/execution. These factors collectively classify the code as malicious."

It serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to the extracted external host and port. This behavior constitutes unauthorized system reconnaissance and exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment and user information to an attacker-controlled server. The use of a hardcoded suspicious IP, lack of user interaction or notification, absence of error logging, and direct network exfiltration of host and user data are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance payloads."

It downloads a file from a hardcoded external IP address (http://77.244.210.247/burpcollaborator.txt) without user consent or notification, then reads its contents. The first line of this file is parsed to extract a hostname and port, which are then used to send a POST request containing detailed system information, including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package version. This constitutes unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive system and user data. The use of a hardcoded IP address and a suspicious filename (burpcollaborator.txt) further suggests this is a covert data exfiltration attempt. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling, and the code runs automatically upon import or execution, indicating stealthy operation. These behaviors align with known malware patterns of reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."

The presence of a shell script named 'main_reverse_shell.sh' strongly suggests malicious intent, as reverse shells are commonly used to gain unauthorized remote access to a system. Executing multiple scripts during preinstall without clear necessity is suspicious and could be used to execute harmful code or compromise the environment."
