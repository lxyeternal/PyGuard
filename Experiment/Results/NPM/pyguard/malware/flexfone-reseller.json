It collects additional system information such as hostname, platform, and user info, then serializes all this data into JSON. Immediately afterward, it sends this sensitive information via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain 'nzqsznocud9iy7nwplpa96wq8he82zqo.oastify.com', which is not related to any known legitimate service. There is no user interaction, notification, or error handling that would indicate a benign or authorized data collection. This pattern of reading sensitive system files and exfiltrating them to an external, attacker-controlled server is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically data exfiltration and reconnaissance. According to the provided knowledge points, such direct collection and transmission of sensitive system data to unknown external endpoints without user consent is a strong indicator of malware."
