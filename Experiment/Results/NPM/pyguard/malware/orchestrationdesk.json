It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (https://eofj4qpoel4uo5n.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction, consent, or notification. The endpoint is a non-standard, suspicious domain commonly used for capturing exfiltrated data in testing or malicious contexts. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data collection and exfiltration. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment information and silently transmitting it to an external, hardcoded server is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."

This is suspicious because 'index.js' is not a standard command or script, and running a JavaScript file as a shell command can execute arbitrary code. Without further inspection of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially malicious as it could run harmful code during package installation."
