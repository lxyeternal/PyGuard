      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to establish TCP connections to hardcoded external IP addresses (100.88.184.15 and 11.144.174.38) on a non-standard port (18393) without user interaction or notification. Upon successful connection, it collects sensitive system information such as username, platform, OS release, and hostname, encodes this data in base64, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious endpoint constructed from the connected IP and port 8443 ('http://<addr>:8443/setting/profile'). Immediately after sending this data, it executes a shell command that downloads and executes a shell script from the same remote server using curl, which is a classic remote code execution and payload delivery technique. Additionally, it runs a shell command to install an npm package '@ali/secure_identity_login_module' in a directory derived from the current working directory, which could be used for persistence or further malicious activity. The script then terminates the process without any error handling or user notification. The combination of hardcoded external IPs, environment fingerprinting, data exfiltration, remote shell execution, and package installation without user consent or legitimate purpose strongly classifies this code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json runs a 'preinstall' script executing 'node load.js' before installation, which is a common vector for malicious code execution. Additionally, the 'config' field sets 'unsafe-perm' to true, allowing scripts to run with elevated permissions, increasing risk. The main entry point is 'load.js', but no source code is provided to verify its behavior. The combination of a preinstall script running arbitrary code with elevated permissions and lack of transparency about 'load.js' is suspicious and potentially malicious."
