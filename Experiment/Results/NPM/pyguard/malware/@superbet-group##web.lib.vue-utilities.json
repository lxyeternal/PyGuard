      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a network socket and connects to a hardcoded external IP address (207.154.222.173) on port 4444, then spawns a shell process (/bin/sh) and pipes the shell's input and output to the network socket. This is a classic reverse shell pattern, which allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The code runs immediately and silently, with no error handling or logging, and no legitimate user-facing functionality. The direct coupling of network connection to an external IP and spawning an interactive shell is a hallmark of malware, specifically remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors. This pattern is exclusively observed in malicious samples and never in benign software, making it a highly reliable indicator of malicious intent."
