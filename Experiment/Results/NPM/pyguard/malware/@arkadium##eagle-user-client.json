      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a preinstall script that runs a JavaScript file named ./.pbk.js with arguments. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts run automatically before package installation, and the script name is hidden (starts with a dot), which is a common tactic to conceal malicious code. Additionally, the description mentions 'Dependency Confusion POC', indicating this package may be designed to exploit dependency confusion vulnerabilities. Without the content of ./.pbk.js, it is not possible to definitively state the exact malicious actions, but the presence of a hidden preinstall script strongly suggests malicious intent."
