      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and recursively enumerates files from root directories (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from system data, which is a common reconnaissance technique. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation function that appears designed to evade detection on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. The combination of host fingerprinting, file system enumeration, and silent exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
