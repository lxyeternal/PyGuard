      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, current working directory, username, and the public IP address by executing shell commands. It then constructs a JSON payload containing this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ckhp9tz2vtc0000ykrxggj34g7cyyyyyk.oast.fun), which is indicative of data exfiltration. The use of exec to run shell commands that include network communication to an attacker-controlled endpoint, combined with the immediate deletion of the 'index.js' file (likely to cover tracks), and suppression of console output (overriding console.log to a no-op) are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction, error handling for the network operation is minimal and only logs errors to console.error, and the domain used is not related to any known benign service. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, stealthy data exfiltration, and cleanup to evade detection."
