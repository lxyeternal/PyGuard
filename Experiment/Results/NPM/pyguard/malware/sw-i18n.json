      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command via Node.js's child_process.exec that collects system information (hostname, current working directory, current user) and appends a fixed string 'sw-i18n'. It then performs a curl request to an external URL (https://js.rip/nvjy3ak1e8), fetching remote content. The entire output is then piped through xxd (hex dump), head, and a loop that performs DNS lookups to the suspicious domain js.rip/nvjy3ak1e8. This sequence combines system reconnaissance (hostname, pwd, whoami), remote code retrieval (curl from an untrusted external domain), and network communication (DNS queries to suspicious domains). The use of exec with a complex shell command that fetches and processes remote data without user consent or notification, targeting an obscure external domain, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code lacks error handling for the network operation and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, remote payload retrieval, and system fingerprinting. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This means that before installation, it executes the 'index.js' file and suppresses all output and errors, which is a common technique to hide malicious activity. Additionally, the description 'RCE POC BY REWTERZ' suggests this package is a proof of concept for Remote Code Execution, indicating intentional malicious behavior. The author name and the script behavior strongly suggest this package is designed to execute potentially harmful code during installation."
