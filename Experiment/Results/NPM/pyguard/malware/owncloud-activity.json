It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ccvcq1w2vtc00004hmxgggpsmohyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses errors silently, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The domain used resembles those commonly employed for testing exfiltration or command-and-control in malicious contexts. This pattern of gathering detailed host environment data and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without any legitimate purpose or transparency is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware."
