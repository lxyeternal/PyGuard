      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and environment information, including environment variables, hostname, OS details, CPU info, memory stats, and network interfaces, then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external URL (webhook.site). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity: it performs automated environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration without user consent or notification, sends sensitive system information to an external endpoint unrelated to any legitimate application purpose, and lacks any user interaction or error handling that would indicate benign intent. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong hallmark of malware or spyware. There is no legitimate business logic or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node preinstall.js' before installation. This script can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during installation, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the dependencies include suspicious packages such as 'http' version '0.0.1-security', 'https' version '^1.0.0', and 'os' version '^0.1.1', which are not standard Node.js core modules but rather small packages that can be used to hijack or spoof core modules. These packages have been known to be used in malicious or typosquatting attacks. The combination of a preinstall script and suspicious dependencies strongly suggests potential malicious intent."
