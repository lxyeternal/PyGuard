      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in a custom hex-based format combined with network interface information and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data. It then sends this information silently to an external, hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs multiple conditional checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. The data exfiltration includes potentially sensitive environment and file system information, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior, and the external domain is suspicious and unrelated to any known benign service. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding, and silent exfiltration to a hardcoded external server without consent or transparency strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package has no author information and a misleading description ('azure package') that does not clarify its purpose, which can be a tactic to disguise malicious intent."
