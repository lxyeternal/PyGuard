      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains clear indicators of malicious behavior. The suspicious logic is in the block that executes if 'parent' is not a string (i.e., if the module is not being required from a CLI or a git repo). In this case, the code attempts to locate a file by resolving Buffer.from([100,108,45,116,97,114]).toString(), which decodes to 'dl-tar'. It then tries to overwrite its own source file (__filename) by replacing the code that checks for the parent module with a simple 'module.exports', effectively removing the anti-analysis or anti-debugging logic. It also attempts to modify the 'dl-tar' file by removing a line matching '\\n\\s*cb\\(null, chunk\\);', which could be an attempt to patch or disable a callback, possibly to alter the behavior of another module. These self-modifying and cross-file-modifying behaviors are highly suspicious and are not found in benign packages. They are typical of malware that attempts to evade detection, disable security checks, or persist in the system. The code executes these file modifications automatically, without user interaction or consent, and suppresses all exceptions, which is a common stealth technique. The rest of the code exports a seemingly benign function, but the presence of the self-modifying logic is a strong indicator of supply chain attack or malicious intent.",
