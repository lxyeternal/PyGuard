It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The domain used is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package purpose. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: automated host fingerprinting, stealthy data exfiltration, use of encoded identifiers, and communication with an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and exfiltration malware embedded in a package, likely for supply chain attack or unauthorized data theft."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name and description ('plugin-syntax-typescript' and 'azure package') do not clearly relate, which may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious activity."
