      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes multiple shell commands to collect sensitive system information, including private IP addresses, current user identity, hostname, contents of /etc/passwd, PHP version, Linux distribution details, and the location of bash. Critically, it attempts to spawn an interactive reverse shell connecting to a remote server (0.tcp.in.ngrok.io on port 14528), which provides unauthorized remote access to the host system. All collected data, including the output of the reverse shell command, is serialized into JSON and exfiltrated via an HTTPS POST request to an external, hardcoded endpoint (eo2z7l1ydft6861.m.pipedream.net) without any user consent or notification. The combination of reconnaissance commands, reverse shell spawning, and data exfiltration to a suspicious external server is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, indicating unauthorized data theft and remote control capabilities. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling, and the code operates silently, further confirming its malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is suspicious because it can be used to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during installation, which is a common vector for malicious activity."
