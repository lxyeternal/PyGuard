It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cnsnlr0poqvrt6glausgq83ue5rsr45nz.oast.pro), which is a non-standard domain often used for testing or malicious exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an attacker-controlled server is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The absence of any benign context, combined with the suspicious external endpoint and stealthy behavior, confirms that this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation without visible output can be used to execute malicious payloads or perform unwanted actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the use of a silent preinstall script is a common tactic in malicious packages."
