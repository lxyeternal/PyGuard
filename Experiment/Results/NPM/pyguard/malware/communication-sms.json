      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from system data, which is a common reconnaissance and exfiltration technique. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. The data exfiltration to an external, suspicious domain combined with host fingerprinting and directory enumeration is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, and the code runs automatically upon module load, indicating stealthy behavior. These factors collectively indicate that the code is designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, constituting malicious behavior."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
