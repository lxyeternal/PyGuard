      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a network socket that connects to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.255.128) on port 443 and, upon connection, immediately spawns a shell process (/bin/sh). It then pipes the network socket's input to the shell's stdin and the shell's stdout back to the socket, effectively creating a reverse shell. This allows an external attacker controlling the IP to execute arbitrary shell commands on the host machine without user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and attempts to reconnect every 5 seconds if the connection closes, indicating persistence and stealth. Such behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, enabling unauthorized remote control of the system. There is no legitimate or benign use case for this pattern in typical JavaScript/NPM packages, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious and potentially malicious scripts. The 'preinstall' script runs a command to add a new user with a preset password on the system, which is a serious security risk and unauthorized system modification. The 'postinstall' script executes a shell script named 'evil.sh', which by its name strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the dependency on 'event-stream' version ^3.0.0 is notable because this package has a known history of being compromised in the past. Overall, these factors indicate malicious behavior."
