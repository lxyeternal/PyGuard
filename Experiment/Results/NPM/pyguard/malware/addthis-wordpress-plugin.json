      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, package version, and the entire package.json content. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (356sv2lpkjygtxa2jimze3fvrmxdl59u.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host-specific information and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, as it violates user privacy and security without legitimate purpose."

This behavior is suspicious because it fetches data from an untrusted external source during installation, which could be used to download or execute malicious code. Such external network calls in lifecycle scripts are a common vector for malicious activity."
