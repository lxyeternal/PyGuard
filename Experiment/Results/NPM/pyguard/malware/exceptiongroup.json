It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ck4j34ctai0idl5jhslghsdrydw9sqase.oast.site), which is a known pattern for out-of-band interaction testing and often used for exfiltration or command-and-control. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host-specific information and exfiltrating it silently to an attacker-controlled endpoint without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
