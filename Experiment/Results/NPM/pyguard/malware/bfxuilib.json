      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. The code performs multiple DNS lookups to these constructed queries, effectively exfiltrating host fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends a JSON string containing detailed system and user information via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data collected and exfiltrated includes sensitive environment details and network configuration, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The absence of error logging and the silent network communication further indicate an intent to evade detection. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host profiling and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
