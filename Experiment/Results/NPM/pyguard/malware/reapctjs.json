      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of system and user information without any user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The code runs automatically upon import or execution without any user interaction or legitimate purpose, and there is no error handling or logging to inform the user of this data transmission. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized network communication, and exfiltration of sensitive environment data to an attacker-controlled endpoint."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'reapctjs' is a misspelling of 'reactjs', and the repository URL points to a suspicious repository named 'AngulerJS' (a misspelling of 'AngularJS'), which are common tactics used in dependency confusion or typosquatting attacks. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further suggests this package is designed to exploit such attacks. Overall, the combination of a preinstall script executing code and the typosquatting indicators strongly suggest malicious intent."
