      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication immediately upon module execution, indicating automated data exfiltration. The use of hostname and path-based conditional checks to selectively avoid execution on certain environments suggests evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The behavior matches known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and covert exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, which is a hallmark of malware or supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has minimal metadata and an unusually high version number, which can be indicators of a potentially malicious or untrustworthy package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a red flag."
