      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, DNS servers, current directory, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names that are sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious domain without any user consent or notification. The code performs these network communications silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealthy data exfiltration. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive environment data, DNS lookups to attacker-controlled domains, and HTTP POST exfiltration to a hardcoded suspicious endpoint is a strong hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident for this behavior in typical package code, and the domain used is not related to the package or any known benign service. Therefore, this code is malicious as it performs unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive system and user information to an attacker-controlled server."
