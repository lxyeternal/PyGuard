      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares an unusually large number of dependencies, all with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The package names appear to be random Latin-like phrases, which is a common tactic to evade detection. This pattern is highly suspicious and typical of malicious or typosquatting packages designed to inject malicious code or backdoors when installed. Additionally, there are no scripts or other metadata that would justify such a large dependency tree, and the repository URL is generic and likely fake. This strongly suggests the package is part of a malicious supply chain attack or malware distribution."
