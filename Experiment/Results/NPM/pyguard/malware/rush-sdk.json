      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code performs multiple DNS lookups on encoded queries and then sends a POST request containing serialized environment and file data to the external server. The data collected includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents from system and user root folders. The code also contains multiple conditional checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion or targeting behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The network communication is silent with suppressed error handling, indicating stealth. These behaviors match strong indicators of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware, consistent with supply chain or post-installation malware patterns. Therefore, this code is malicious as it performs unauthorized collection and exfiltration of system and user data to an attacker-controlled external server without user consent."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to perform malicious actions such as modifying files, stealing data, or installing additional malware. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
