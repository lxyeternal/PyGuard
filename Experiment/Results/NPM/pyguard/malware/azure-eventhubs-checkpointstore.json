      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata without any user interaction or consent. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS queries to a suspicious hardcoded domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. The data exfiltration is done silently without error logging or user notification. The code accesses sensitive environment details and network information and transmits them to an attacker-controlled server, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this behavior. The use of DNS queries combined with HTTPS POST to a hardcoded, non-standard domain for data exfiltration strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
