      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits several characteristics strongly associated with malicious or suspicious behavior, particularly in the context of supply chain attacks and information exfiltration. Specifically: (1) The code makes an unsolicited HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, non-standard, and suspicious domain (http://lolzettle-bololaccount-settings.package.0xlupin.com) during execution, which is a common technique for beaconing, tracking installations, or establishing command-and-control (C2) communication. (2) The code runs automatically and without user interaction or consent, which is typical of malicious code embedded in package installation scripts. (3) The package name and domain structure suggest typosquatting or an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package, which is a known malware distribution tactic. (4) There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation justifying the need to contact this external server. (5) The code could be used for tracking, fingerprinting, or as a first-stage check-in for further malicious payload delivery. While the code does not directly exfiltrate sensitive data or execute arbitrary code, its behavior matches known patterns of malware that perform environment reconnaissance or establish a foothold for further attacks. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json file specifies a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node app.js' automatically during the installation process. This means that arbitrary JavaScript code in app.js will be executed on the user's system as soon as the package is installed, without any user interaction or consent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution at install time. The use of a preinstall hook to execute code is rarely justified in benign packages, especially when the main entry point is also app.js, and there is no documentation or legitimate reason provided. This behavior is considered highly suspicious and is a common vector for malicious payload delivery, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
