      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The conditional checks on hostname and paths appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments, indicating evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding, and exfiltration to a suspicious external server without user interaction or consent strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with malware behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
