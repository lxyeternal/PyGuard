      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an outbound HTTPS GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious domain 'https://qj24bop62ehe2j4f73doo9f61.canarytokens.com'. Canarytokens domains are commonly used for detecting unauthorized access or exfiltration attempts, indicating this request is likely a beacon or callback to an attacker-controlled server. The code does not perform any legitimate user interaction, authentication, or provide any benign functionality. It silently sends a network request to an external endpoint without user consent or notification, which is a classic behavior of malware performing host fingerprinting or exfiltration. Although the code does not execute further payloads or shell commands, the presence of a hardcoded suspicious callback URL and the immediate network communication to it strongly indicate malicious intent."
