      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in a custom hex and dotted format, constructs DNS query names, and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml). It then sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user interaction or notification. The code includes multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths, likely to evade detection or avoid running in analysis environments. The data exfiltration is done stealthily with suppressed error handling and no logging, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The domain used is not related to any legitimate service and is hardcoded, which is a strong indicator of malicious command-and-control or data exfiltration infrastructure. The overall behavior matches known malware patterns of host fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code, and it operates silently upon import or execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
