It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (\"cao7fopgfihso700cu0goxnnm6twgh1a1.dooracle.in\") without any user consent, notification, or legitimate purpose. The domain name appears random and unrelated to any known service, which is a common trait of command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoints used by malware. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no user interaction, authentication, or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. This pattern of gathering sensitive host and user information and exfiltrating it silently to an attacker-controlled server is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with reconnaissance and data theft malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without seeing the content of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and often used in malicious packages to execute unwanted code on the user's system."
