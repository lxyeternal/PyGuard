The domain 'oastify.com' is commonly used for out-of-band application security testing and is not a legitimate API endpoint for any known contest or public service. This pattern matches several high-risk and critical-risk indicators: (1) exfiltration of sensitive data (credentials) to an attacker-controlled server, (2) use of a suspicious, hardcoded remote endpoint, (3) lack of user notification or consent before sending data externally, and (4) no validation or legitimate business logic for the network communication. The code is designed to collect and transmit user credentials to a remote server, which is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware. Even though the username and api_key are not set in the code, the intent and structure are clear and malicious.",
