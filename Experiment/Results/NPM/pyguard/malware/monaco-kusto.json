      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication only if certain hostname, username, and path conditions are not met, indicating evasion or targeting specific environments. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for transmitting encoded system data strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with data exfiltration and host fingerprinting. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data collection and exfiltration to a suspicious external server without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
