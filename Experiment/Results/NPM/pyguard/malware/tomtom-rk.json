      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information including the hostname, home directory, and current directory, then serializes this data to JSON. It encodes this data into hex chunks and exfiltrates it via DNS queries to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain ('dns.dependency-c4llb4ck.0lo.org'). The use of DNS resolution for data exfiltration is a known covert channel technique to bypass network monitoring. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose for this data collection and transmission. The conditional exit on a specific hostname suggests evasion or targeting behavior. The domain used for exfiltration is unrelated to any known legitimate service and appears attacker-controlled. These factors combined—collection of sensitive environment data, encoding and chunking, exfiltration over DNS to a suspicious external domain, error suppression, and lack of legitimate functionality—are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."
