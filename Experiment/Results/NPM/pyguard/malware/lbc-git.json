It attempts to exfiltrate this information to an external server ('haxx.cc') via an HTTPS GET request with the data base64-encoded in the URL query string. If the HTTPS request fails, it falls back to exfiltration via DNS queries to a hardcoded domain ('.e.haxx.cc'), encoding the data in DNS query subdomains. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of DNS queries for data exfiltration is a known stealth technique to bypass network monitoring. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an intent to avoid detection. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The hardcoded external domains and the exfiltration methods strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with reconnaissance and data leakage malware. Despite the comment claiming research purposes, the actual behavior matches typical malware patterns of system fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration."

This means that arbitrary JavaScript code in 'src/index.js' will execute automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unwanted commands, downloading malware, or modifying the system. Without inspecting 'src/index.js', this automatic execution on install is suspicious and potentially malicious."
