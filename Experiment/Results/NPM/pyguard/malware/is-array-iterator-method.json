      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication only if certain hostname, username, and path conditions are met, indicating evasion or targeting specific environments. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for exfiltration, combined with the stealthy checks and lack of error logging, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with malware behavior, specifically host fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name and version are unusual ('is-array-iterator-method' with version '99.10.9'), and the description is vague ('azbit package'), which are common signs of a potentially malicious or typosquatting package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious code, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local script is a red flag."
