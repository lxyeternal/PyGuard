      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in a custom hex-based format combined with network and path information, then sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed domain names derived from the collected data, which is a known technique for covert data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently and does not log or notify the user, indicating stealth. Collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system and user environment data to an attacker-controlled external server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing and covert exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
