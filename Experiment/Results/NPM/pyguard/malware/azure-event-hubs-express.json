It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or notification. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The domain used is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package purpose. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, environment reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely part of a supply chain attack or information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
