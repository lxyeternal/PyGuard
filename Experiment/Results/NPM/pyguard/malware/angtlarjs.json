It then serializes this information into a string and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The code runs automatically (immediately invoked async function) upon import or execution, with no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling to indicate benign intent. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL used for data exfiltration, combined with the collection of sensitive environment and network information, strongly indicates that this code is designed for reconnaissance and unauthorized data leakage, consistent with malware or spyware behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'angtlarjs' is similar to the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be attempting a dependency confusion attack. The repository and author information point to a GitHub user named 'serialfuzzer', which is known for security research and sometimes publishing proof-of-concept malicious packages. Overall, the presence of a preinstall script running an unknown file combined with the naming and keywords strongly indicates malicious intent."
