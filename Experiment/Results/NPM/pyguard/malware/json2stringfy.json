      "malicious_behavior": "The code silently performs an HTTP GET request to an external, hardcoded URL ('https://npmrepos.com/checkupdate.php') and writes the response body directly into a file named 'jsontoken' inside a hidden directory '.vscode' in the user's home directory. It disables TLS certificate validation by setting 'NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED' to 0, which allows insecure HTTPS connections and increases risk. The code creates a hidden directory in the user's home folder without user consent and writes potentially untrusted data fetched from a remote server into a file there. This behavior is consistent with malware patterns involving remote payload retrieval and local persistence. There is no user interaction, no error handling, no logging, and no legitimate purpose or documentation explaining this network communication and file write. The use of a suspicious external domain, silent network communication, writing to a user profile hidden directory, and disabling TLS verification are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that stages payloads for later execution or exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'npm install sync-request' and then executes 'node main.js'. Running arbitrary code during installation is a common vector for malicious behavior. The 'main.js' file is not provided, so its contents are unknown, but executing a script during preinstall can be used to run malicious code on the user's machine without explicit consent. Additionally, the dependency 'sync-request' is a synchronous HTTP request library, which could be used by 'main.js' to send or receive data during installation. Overall, the presence of a preinstall script running a custom node script is suspicious and potentially malicious."
