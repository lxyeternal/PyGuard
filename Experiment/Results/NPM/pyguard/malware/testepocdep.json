      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'test' script that, when run, echoes a command to perform a DNS lookup (nslookup) to a highly suspicious, random subdomain (sjf61doyw5c55z88r0mou26xuo0fo6cv.oastify.com). The oastify.com domain is commonly used for out-of-band application security testing (OAST), which is a technique often leveraged by attackers to detect if code is being executed in a target environment by monitoring for DNS or HTTP requests to attacker-controlled domains. While the script only echoes the command and does not execute it directly, its presence is highly suspicious and indicative of a potential supply chain attack or reconnaissance attempt. If a user or CI system were to modify the script to execute the command, or if the script were changed to run automatically (e.g., as a preinstall/postinstall hook), it could leak information about the environment to an external server controlled by an attacker. This pattern matches known reconnaissance and exfiltration techniques used in malicious packages, especially those that use DNS queries to detect installations or gather host information without user consent.",
