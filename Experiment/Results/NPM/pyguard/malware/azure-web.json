      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the data collection. The use of DNS lookups on encoded queries and an HTTPS POST to an external server strongly indicates covert data exfiltration. The domain is suspicious and unrelated to any known benign service. This pattern of host fingerprinting combined with stealthy network communication to an attacker-controlled server is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no indication of benign purpose or user consent, and the code runs automatically on import or execution, which is typical of supply chain or runtime malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information stealing and covert exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
