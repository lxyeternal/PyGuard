It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (\"bluehost-ccpv1rf2vtc00005nvw0ggmpohryyyyyb.mybeautifuliframe.com\") without any user consent or notification. The domain name appears unrelated to any legitimate service and is likely attacker-controlled. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data exfiltration. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this is suspicious because running arbitrary code on install can be used to execute malicious payloads, steal data, or compromise the system. Additionally, the description 'H1 research - please do not delete for 2 hours, sorry for the hassle!' is unusual and may indicate temporary or experimental code, which can be a red flag."
