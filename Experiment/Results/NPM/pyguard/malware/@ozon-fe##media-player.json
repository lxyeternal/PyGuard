      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the current working directory (__dirname), the hostname, and the username of the OS user. It serializes this data into JSON, then encodes it as a hex string and splits it into chunks. It then constructs multiple DNS query strings embedding these chunks and sends DNS lookup requests to a suspicious external domain (for-research.ru) using hardcoded DNS servers (77.88.8.7 and 8.8.8.8). This pattern is a classic form of data exfiltration via DNS tunneling, where encoded sensitive information is covertly sent out without user consent or notification. The code lacks any legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling, indicating stealth. The use of random IDs in the DNS queries further suggests an attempt to evade detection or correlation. Collecting and exfiltrating user and host information to an external domain without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means that arbitrary JavaScript code in 'index.js' will execute automatically during the package installation process, which can be used to run malicious code on the victim's machine. Although the description claims the code is not malicious, the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior and should be treated as suspicious unless the content of 'index.js' is verified safe."
