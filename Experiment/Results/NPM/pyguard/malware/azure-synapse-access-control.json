      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in offensive security and malware contexts. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, effectively leaking system information via DNS requests. Additionally, it sends the collected data as an HTTP POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is stealthy, with error handling suppressing errors and no logging or user interaction. The domain used is not related to any legitimate package functionality and is hardcoded, indicating intent to communicate with an attacker-controlled server. The combination of gathering sensitive host and user environment data, encoding it, performing DNS queries, and sending HTTP POST requests to a suspicious external domain is a classic pattern of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code, and it lacks transparency, user consent, or error reporting. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
