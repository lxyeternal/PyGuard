It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known for use in security testing and often abused for exfiltration or command-and-control. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The code performs these network communications silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealthy data exfiltration. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding data into DNS queries, and POSTing sensitive environment and user information to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware or supply chain attacks."
