      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user-specific information including hostname, architecture, platform, OS release, temporary directory, total memory, uptime, user ID, group ID, username, home directory, shell, current filename, and the list of files in the user's home directory. It also enumerates network interfaces and their IP addresses. This collected information is concatenated, hex-encoded, and then exfiltrated via DNS lookup requests to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain ('.ex.neversummer.xyz'). The use of DNS queries for data exfiltration is a known covert channel technique to bypass network monitoring. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose evident in the code. The domain used is not a standard or known benign domain, indicating potential attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code lacks error handling or logging for the network operations, suggesting an intent to operate stealthily. Collecting and transmitting such detailed system and user environment data without consent is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package name '@xvideos/alerts' is suspicious because it uses the name of a well-known adult website, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The presence of a 'preinstall' script running 'node build-project.js' is concerning because it executes code before installation, which can be used to run arbitrary or harmful commands. Without the content of 'build-project.js', it is impossible to verify the safety of this script, but combined with the suspicious package name, this strongly suggests potential malicious intent."
