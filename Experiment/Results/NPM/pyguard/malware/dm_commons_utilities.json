It serializes this data into JSON, then encodes it for an HTTP POST request sent to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (7aiukqrluftly941n5sfoyvu2l8cw2kr.oastify.com). This domain is not related to the package's legitimate functionality and resembles domains used for testing or malicious exfiltration. The code performs this data collection and exfiltration silently without user consent, interaction, or notification. It suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host-specific information and sending it to an external, hardcoded endpoint without any legitimate purpose or user awareness is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is strongly associated with malware and is a critical risk indicator of malicious activity."
