      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths without user consent. It encodes this data into a custom hex-based format combined with network and path information, then sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). The code performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed domain names derived from local system data, which is a known reconnaissance and exfiltration technique. The data collection includes potentially sensitive directories (e.g., C:\\, D:\\, /root, /home) and user information, which is then exfiltrated silently without any user interaction or notification. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. The network communication is done without error logging or user awareness, indicating stealth. These behaviors align with typical malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure, consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to run malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'testing-library__jest-dom' mimics a popular legitimate package but uses a double underscore instead of a single, which is a common tactic for typosquatting. The version number '99.10.9' is unusually high and likely intended to bypass version checks. The description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated to the package name, further indicating potential malicious intent."
