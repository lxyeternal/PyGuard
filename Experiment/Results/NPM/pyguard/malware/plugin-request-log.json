      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication only if certain hostname, username, and path conditions are met, indicating evasion or targeting specific environments. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The absence of legitimate user-facing functionality, combined with stealthy data collection and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with credential or asset theft and system fingerprinting. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has no author information and a misleading description ('azure package') which may be an attempt to appear legitimate. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious activity."
