      "malicious_behavior": "The code immediately makes an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (23.94.46.191) to fetch '/update.json'. Upon receiving the response, it concatenates the data chunks into a string and then dynamically constructs a function call to execute the fetched data as code. Specifically, it uses an obfuscated way to access the Buffer.from constructor, creates a Buffer from the response body, and then calls the resulting object as a function. This pattern is a classic example of remote code retrieval and dynamic execution without any user interaction, error handling, or logging. The use of a hardcoded IP address instead of a domain, the obfuscated dynamic function call, and the immediate execution of remotely fetched code are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This code effectively downloads and executes arbitrary code from an external source, which is a hallmark of malware, remote code execution attacks, or supply chain compromise. There is no legitimate or benign purpose for such behavior in typical JavaScript or NPM packages."
