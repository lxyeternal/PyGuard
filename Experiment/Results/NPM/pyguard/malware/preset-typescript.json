It then encodes this data into a hex-encoded string combined with network and path information, constructs DNS queries, and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain environment conditions are met (via the isValid function), it sends this collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication to a hardcoded, non-standard domain, which is a strong indicator of data exfiltration. The data collected is sensitive system and user environment information, and the transmission to an external server is done stealthily. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. These characteristics align with known malicious patterns of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware, making this code malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'preset-typescript' and description 'azure package' do not clearly relate, which may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious code."
