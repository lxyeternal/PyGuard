      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious behavior in both the 'install' script and the 'dependencies' section. The 'install' script runs an 'npm install' command that fetches a tarball from an untrusted external URL (http://a.heliohost.us/tastytreats-1.0.0.tgz) with a query parameter that includes the npm cache path, which is unusual and potentially used to leak environment information or execute arbitrary code. Additionally, the dependency 'tastytreats-pg-ng-popover' is also fetched from the same untrusted external URL, which could contain malicious code. Using external URLs for dependencies and install scripts without verification is a common vector for supply chain attacks and indicates malicious intent."
