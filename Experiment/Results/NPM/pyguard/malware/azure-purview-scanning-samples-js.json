      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication conditionally based on hostname and path checks, likely to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The absence of legitimate user-facing functionality, combined with stealthy data collection and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with credential or asset theft, host fingerprinting, and command-and-control communication. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, host profiling, and covert network communication to suspicious external endpoints."
