It dynamically constructs and executes code, collects sensitive system information such as hostname and user directory, executes shell commands, and sends collected data via HTTPS POST requests to a hardcoded external domain. The code uses obfuscation techniques including encoded strings, dynamic function generation, and indirect calls to evade detection. It reads environment variables, executes system commands via execSync, and performs network communication without any user interaction or notification. The combination of environment profiling, data exfiltration to an external server, obfuscated code execution, and lack of legitimate functionality strongly indicates that this code is designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
