      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, DNS servers, current directory, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names that are sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious domain without any user consent or notification. The code performs these network communications silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealthy data exfiltration. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and user data, encoding it, and transmitting it to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, external communication to suspicious endpoints, and exfiltration of sensitive system information without user consent."
