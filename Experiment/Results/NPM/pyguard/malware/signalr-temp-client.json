      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, package version, and the entire package.json content. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (a pipedream.net URL, which is commonly used for capturing and testing exfiltrated data). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic explaining this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an intent to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering host-specific and user-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded, suspicious endpoint without consent is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior, consistent with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command via Node.js's child_process.exec that collects sensitive system information including hostname, current working directory, and current user. It then appends a fixed string 'n-messaging-client' and performs a curl request to an external, suspicious domain (https://vg8ubk.dnslog.cn). The output of these commands is then piped through xxd and head, and a DNS lookup (nslookup) is performed on the suspicious domain. This sequence indicates automated host fingerprinting and exfiltration of system information to an attacker-controlled external server without user consent or notification. The use of shell execution with concatenated commands, network communication to a hardcoded suspicious domain, and exfiltration of environment details are classic hallmarks of malicious behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling that would justify this pattern. Therefore, this code is strongly indicative of malware performing reconnaissance and data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node adham.js' before installation. This means that arbitrary JavaScript code in 'adham.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as downloading malware, stealing credentials, or modifying the system. Without inspecting 'adham.js' itself, the presence of this preinstall script is suspicious and potentially malicious."
