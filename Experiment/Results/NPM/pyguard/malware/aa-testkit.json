It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (\"http://alter.cderwc12vtc0000pa6cgggzcqgyyyyyyb.oast.fun\") over HTTPS. The domain is non-standard and appears to be attacker-controlled, commonly used for exfiltration or command-and-control. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose for this data collection and transmission. The combination of gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an external, suspicious endpoint is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Additionally, the code uses minimal error handling and outputs response data directly to stdout without any benign context. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."
