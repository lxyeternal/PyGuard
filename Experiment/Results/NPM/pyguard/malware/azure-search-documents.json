It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known for use in security testing and often abused for exfiltration. It performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, which can be used for covert data exfiltration. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data sent includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling, and the network communication is stealthy and automated. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or a supply chain attack payload."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Additionally, the package name 'azure-search-documents' with a very high version number and the description 'azure whitehat package' could be an attempt to impersonate a legitimate package. The lack of author information and the presence of a preinstall script are red flags indicating potential malicious behavior."
