      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data into a hex-encoded string combined with network and path information, then performs DNS lookups on a suspicious, hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain conditions are met (mostly excluding known or local hostnames/paths), it sends this collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs no legitimate user-facing functionality. The domain used is not related to any known benign service and is likely attacker-controlled. This pattern of host fingerprinting combined with silent exfiltration of system and user environment data to an external server is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate purpose or documentation for this behavior, and the code runs automatically on import or execution, indicating a supply chain or runtime compromise risk."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious payloads or compromise the system. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-proposal-private-methods' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to any known legitimate package, and the description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated. The combination of an unusual preinstall script and misleading metadata suggests potential malicious intent."
