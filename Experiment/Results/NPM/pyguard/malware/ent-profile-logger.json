      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a suspicious preinstall script: '1preinstall': 'sh install.sh'. This script will execute a shell script (install.sh) automatically during the installation process, which is a high-risk vector for supply chain attacks. Executing arbitrary shell scripts at install time is a common technique used by malicious packages to run unauthorized code on the user's system without their knowledge or consent. The script name '1preinstall' is non-standard (the correct lifecycle event is 'preinstall'), which may be an attempt to evade automated detection or to be triggered by a custom process. The actual content of install.sh is not provided, so its intent cannot be fully determined, but the presence of this hook is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior. No other dependencies or scripts in the package.json are overtly suspicious, but the use of shell execution during installation is a critical red flag.",
