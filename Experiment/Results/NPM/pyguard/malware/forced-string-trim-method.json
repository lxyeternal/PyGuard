      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion techniques to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The code runs automatically upon import or execution, indicating potential use in supply chain attacks or malicious package behavior. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent focused on covert data exfiltration and system fingerprinting."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
