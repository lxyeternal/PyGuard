      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. This behavior is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware, as it fingerprints the host environment and sends sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an external, suspicious domain for sending encoded system data strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with malware reconnaissance and exfiltration techniques."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase without any tests or clear purpose. The 'index.js' file could contain malicious code that runs on the user's machine during installation. Additionally, the package has no author information and a misleading description ('azure package') which could be an attempt to appear legitimate. These factors combined suggest potential malicious behavior."
