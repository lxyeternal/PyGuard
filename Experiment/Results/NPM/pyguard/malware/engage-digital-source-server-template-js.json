      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data into hex strings and constructs DNS query names targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. The code performs multiple DNS lookups to these constructed queries, effectively exfiltrating host-specific fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends a POST request over HTTPS to the same suspicious external domain, transmitting a JSON string containing detailed environment and system information without any user consent or notification. The data collected and exfiltrated includes sensitive identifiers such as username, hostname, IP addresses, and package details. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The absence of error logging and the silent network communication to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain strongly indicate malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, and communication with suspicious external endpoints."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
