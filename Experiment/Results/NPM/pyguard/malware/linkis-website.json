      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and environment information including OS details, environment variables, current working directory, CPU info (with times removed), and filtered network interfaces excluding loopback and localhost addresses. It then serializes this data to JSON, compresses it using Brotli with maximum compression settings, and encodes it in base64. The code contains a large base64-encoded, Brotli-compressed string which is decompressed and immediately passed to eval for execution. This pattern of multi-layered obfuscation (unicode escapes, base64, Brotli compression) combined with dynamic code execution (eval) is a classic hallmark of malicious code. The code also disables NODE_NO_EVAl environment variable, which is a known Node.js environment variable that can disable eval, indicating an attempt to ensure eval runs. There is no user interaction, no legitimate purpose for collecting and compressing such detailed system info, and no logging or error handling. The immediate eval of a large hidden payload strongly suggests execution of a hidden malicious payload, likely for reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or further compromise. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment and host fingerprinting, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of transparency or legitimate functionality."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json references scripts named 'init.js' and 'rsh.js' inside the 'scripts' folder, which are included in the published files. The 'test' and 'init' scripts both execute 'init.js', with the 'test' script running it in the background. The repository URL and author name ('51pwn') suggest potential security research or exploitation context. The presence of a script named 'rsh.js' (commonly shorthand for 'remote shell') is suspicious and may indicate functionality to open a remote shell or backdoor. Additionally, the 'files' array explicitly excludes common documentation and configuration files but includes these scripts, which could be used to execute malicious code. Without the actual script contents, the naming and usage patterns strongly suggest potential malicious behavior, such as unauthorized remote access or code execution."
