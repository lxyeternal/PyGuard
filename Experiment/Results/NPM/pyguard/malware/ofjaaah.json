This behavior is suspicious because it attempts to fetch data from an external server during installation, which could be used to download and execute malicious code or exfiltrate information. Using a raw IP address instead of a domain name is also a common tactic to evade detection. There is no indication of what the curl command does with the response, but running network commands in lifecycle scripts without clear purpose is a red flag."
