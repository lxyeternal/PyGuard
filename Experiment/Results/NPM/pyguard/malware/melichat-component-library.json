It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it as a URL-encoded form, and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ar5hdz0303710t4d9n2979k8bzhq5kt9.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses errors silently. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without legitimate purpose or transparency is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The use of a suspicious hardcoded external endpoint and the absence of any benign business logic or user-facing features further confirm the malicious intent."
