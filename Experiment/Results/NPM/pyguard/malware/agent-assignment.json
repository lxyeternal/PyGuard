      "malicious_behavior": "The preinstall script is highly suspicious and malicious. It attempts to exfiltrate sensitive system information by: 1) Constructing a domain name that includes the hostname and user information, then pinging it to verify connectivity. 2) Collecting environment variables, running processes, system version info, network info, and critical system files such as /etc/hosts, /etc/passwd, and /etc/shadow. 3) Encoding this data in base64 and sending it via HTTP POST requests to a remote server controlled by an attacker (burpcollaborator.net). 4) It also attempts a fallback ping to a Windows-style domain if the first fails. This behavior is typical of malware or spyware designed to gather and leak sensitive system data to an attacker-controlled server during package installation."
