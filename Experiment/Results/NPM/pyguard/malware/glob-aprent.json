      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link) and saves it locally as 'README.txt.lnk' in the current directory. Immediately after the download finishes, it executes this downloaded file using the child_process.exec function. This pattern—automatic retrieval of a remote file and direct execution without user interaction or validation—is a classic hallmark of malware. The use of a .lnk file (Windows shortcut) as the payload is suspicious, as such files can be crafted to execute arbitrary commands or payloads. There is no error handling or user notification, and the code runs automatically upon import or execution. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including remote payload retrieval, local persistence, and immediate execution of untrusted code, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or further malware deployment."
