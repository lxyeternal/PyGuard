      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package version. It serializes this data into JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (en47d1uz958z2v9.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party service often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, commonly abused for data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and the code suppresses error logging for the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded URL without legitimate purpose or transparency is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unauthorized data collection, network communication to suspicious endpoints, and stealthy error suppression."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
