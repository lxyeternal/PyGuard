It then serializes this information into JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user identity data to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL used for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code runs automatically (immediately invoked async function) upon import or execution, with no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling to justify this behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, and use of hardcoded external endpoints for covert communication."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'anbularjs' is a typo-squatting variant of 'angularjs', and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. Without the content of 'new.js', the exact behavior cannot be confirmed, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious activity."
