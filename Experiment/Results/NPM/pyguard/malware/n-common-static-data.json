      "malicious_behavior": "This package.json is highly suspicious and likely malicious for several reasons: (1) The 'main' entry points to 'install.sh', which is a shell script, not a typical JavaScript entry point. (2) The 'preinstall' script executes './install.sh' automatically during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. This allows arbitrary shell commands to run on the user's system without their knowledge or consent. (3) The use of a shell script as the main entry and as a preinstall hook is extremely rare in legitimate npm packages and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution at install time. (4) The dependency 'apidemo-app' is not a well-known or standard package, and could itself be malicious or used to further the attack. (5) There is no documentation or legitimate reason provided for these behaviors. This pattern matches known malware and supply chain attack techniques, where installation scripts are abused to execute unauthorized code, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware installation.",
