It then serializes this information into a string and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is suspicious and strongly indicative of malware or spyware activity. Additionally, the code runs immediately upon import or execution without any legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling beyond logging network errors, further supporting the conclusion that it is designed for covert data theft."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'anpularjs' and repository URL 'AngulerJS' appear to be typos or lookalikes of the popular 'angularjs' package, which is a common tactic in dependency confusion or typosquatting attacks. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further suggests this package is designed to exploit such attacks. Without the content of 'new.js', it is impossible to fully verify the payload, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom JS file is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior."
