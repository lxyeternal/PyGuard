      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and file listings from root and drive directories. It then encodes this data into a custom hex-based format combined with network and path information, constructs DNS query names, and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain environment conditions are met (via isValid function), it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration includes sensitive host fingerprinting and file system enumeration. The code suppresses errors silently, uses hardcoded suspicious domain names, and performs network communication immediately upon module execution. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. These patterns strongly match known malicious behaviors such as host reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, typical of malware or supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
