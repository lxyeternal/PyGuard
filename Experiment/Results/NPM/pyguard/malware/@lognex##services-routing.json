      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the current working directory, script directory, username, and hostname without user consent. It then sends this information as a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (185.62.58.88) on port 8000. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a legitimate domain, combined with the silent exfiltration of system and user data without any user interaction or notification, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code suppresses error logging for the network request, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection. The conditional early return based on hostname values may be an evasion technique to avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this pattern matches known malware behavior of host reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation without visible output can be used to execute malicious actions silently. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the use of a hidden preinstall script is a common tactic in malicious packages."
