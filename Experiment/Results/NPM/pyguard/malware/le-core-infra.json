It serializes this data into JSON, then URL-encodes and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (vxwd9hkn0h2baw8stqh3z0u01r7iv8jx.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses errors silently, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The collection and exfiltration of host-specific and user-sensitive data to an attacker-controlled endpoint without any legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, as it enables attackers to fingerprint the host environment and potentially prepare for further exploitation or data theft."

This means that any code inside index.js will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, downloading malware, or stealing information. Without seeing the contents of index.js, this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious."
