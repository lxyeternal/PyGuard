      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a network request to a hardcoded external IP address (207.154.222.173) without any user interaction or notification. It collects system-specific information (hostname and platform) via the 'os' module and appends this data as query parameters in the HTTP GET request. This behavior matches the pattern of automated system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an external, suspicious endpoint. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection. The code lacks any authentication, error handling beyond logging, or user consent mechanisms. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a domain name further increases suspicion, as it is a common tactic to evade domain-based detection. The code reads the response data and writes it directly to standard output, which could be used for further processing or command-and-control communication. Taken together, these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, specifically unauthorized system information collection and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server."
