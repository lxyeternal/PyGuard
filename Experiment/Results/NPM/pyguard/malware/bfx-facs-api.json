      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in offensive security and malware contexts. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, effectively leaking system fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends a POST request over HTTPS to the same suspicious external domain, transmitting a JSON string containing detailed environment and system information without any user consent or notification. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The domain used is not related to the package's stated purpose and is hardcoded, indicating targeted exfiltration. The code suppresses errors silently and avoids logging, indicating an intent to evade detection. These behaviors—system reconnaissance, encoding and exfiltration of sensitive host data to an attacker-controlled domain, and stealthy network communication—are classic hallmarks of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
