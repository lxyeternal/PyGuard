It serializes this data into JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://nrtc.cdaprzv2vtc0000jgwtgggimcxhyyyyyb.oast.fun) over HTTPS. The domain appears to be a non-standard, attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for exfiltration or command-and-control. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host and user environment data and silently exfiltrating it to an external, suspicious server without consent is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
