      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, current user, a fixed string, and the public IP address (via curl to ifconfig.me). It then encodes this collected data in hex format and sends it via HTTP GET requests to an external, suspicious domain (lulshdazpypdagyixvqzasm9jt0fgtv0n.oast.fun), which is not related to any legitimate service. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: gathering host-specific information without user consent, encoding it, and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled external server. The use of exec to run shell commands that perform reconnaissance and data exfiltration without any user interaction or notification is a hallmark of malicious code. The suspicious external domain and the lack of any legitimate purpose or error handling for the network operation further confirm the malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1', which executes a JavaScript file silently during installation. This behavior is suspicious because it hides any output or errors, potentially allowing malicious code in 'index.js' to run unnoticed. Additionally, the package depends on itself ('vrt_hitlijst_generic_voting'), which is unusual and may cause recursive or unintended behavior. These factors combined suggest potential malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation of the 'index.js' file."
