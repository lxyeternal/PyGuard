It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The isValid function attempts to exclude certain hostnames and paths, likely to evade detection or analysis environments. The overall behavior is consistent with host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The code runs automatically upon module load or execution, indicating potential supply chain or runtime compromise. These factors align strongly with known malicious patterns of reconnaissance and exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package has an unusually high version number (99.10.9) and minimal metadata, which are common signs of a potentially malicious or spoofed package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a red flag."
