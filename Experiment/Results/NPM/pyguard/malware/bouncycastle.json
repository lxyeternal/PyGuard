It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (nkbs2o51otjl1mngnma6bievvm1dp2.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any request errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The collection and exfiltration of host-specific and user-sensitive data to an attacker-controlled endpoint without legitimate purpose or transparency is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious domains, and lack of legitimate business logic."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
