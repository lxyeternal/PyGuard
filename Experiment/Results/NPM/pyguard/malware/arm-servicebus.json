      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication only if certain environment conditions are met (via isValid function), which appears to be an evasion technique. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The absence of legitimate user-facing functionality, combined with stealthy data collection and exfiltration to a suspicious external server, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with credential or asset theft and host fingerprinting. There is no benign justification for this behavior in typical package code, and the pattern matches known malware indicators such as automated environment profiling and covert network exfiltration."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify if it is safe. However, the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
