      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding of sensitive environment data, and transmission to an attacker-controlled server is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no benign justification for this behavior in typical npm packages, and the use of hardcoded suspicious domains, silent network communication, and environment profiling strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'requester-browser-xhr' and description 'azure package' seem generic and potentially misleading. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious code execution."
