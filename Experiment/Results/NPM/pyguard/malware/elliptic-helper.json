      "malicious_behavior": "The code disables TLS certificate validation by setting process.env['NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED'] = 0, which is a common technique to bypass SSL verification and facilitate communication with potentially untrusted servers. It then constructs a hidden directory path inside the user's home directory (~/.vscode), creates it if it does not exist, and synchronously fetches data from an external URL 'https://npmcloudjs.com/checkupdate.php' using a synchronous HTTP GET request. The response body is written directly to a file named 'jsontoken' inside that hidden directory. This behavior is suspicious because it silently downloads and writes data from an external, hardcoded URL into a hidden user directory without any user interaction, notification, or error handling. The domain 'npmcloudjs.com' is not a known official or trusted source related to npm or VSCode. The code does not perform any legitimate or documented operation related to the package's stated purpose, nor does it validate or sanitize the downloaded content. This pattern of disabling SSL verification, creating hidden directories in user profiles, and fetching and writing remote content without user consent is strongly associated with malware, supply chain attacks, or unauthorized data exfiltration/preparation for further malicious payload execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'npm install sync-request' followed by 'node main.js'. Running arbitrary JavaScript code during installation (via 'node main.js') is suspicious because it can execute any code on the user's machine without explicit consent. Additionally, the 'sync-request' package is installed during preinstall, which is unusual and may be used to perform synchronous HTTP requests during installation, potentially to download or exfiltrate data. Since the 'main.js' file is not provided, its exact behavior is unknown, but executing code during preinstall is a common vector for malicious activity."
