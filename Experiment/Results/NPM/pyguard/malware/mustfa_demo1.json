This is a sensitive system file containing user account information. The collected data is serialized into JSON and then sent via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (eo5vod9dq8uoak4.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party service often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, commonly abused for data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, consent, or notification, and error handling for the network request is suppressed, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The combination of gathering sensitive host and user data, executing a shell command to read a critical system file, and exfiltrating this data to an external, hardcoded, suspicious endpoint without any legitimate purpose or transparency is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
