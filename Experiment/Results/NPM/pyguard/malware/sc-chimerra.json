      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated, using encoded strings and dynamic decoding functions, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. It imports core Node.js modules such as 'os', 'fs', and 'crypto' (via 'crypto' module for hashing), and also uses 'https' for network communication. The code performs the following suspicious actions: it reads the user's home directory and searches for files matching specific obfuscated hashes, indicating it is looking for sensitive or targeted files. It computes SHA-256 hashes of filenames or file contents to identify these files. It then performs an existence check on these files and sets a flag accordingly. The code constructs an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, obfuscated external URL (which appears to be a suspicious domain related to 'realbatman.com' or similar), sending JSON data that includes system or user-specific information. The network request is made without any user interaction or notification, and the code suppresses errors, indicating stealth. The code also includes mechanisms to hook or override console methods, likely to evade detection or logging. The obfuscation, combined with the collection of user environment data, file system scanning for specific files, hashing, and exfiltration of data to an external server, matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including credential or data theft and remote command and control. There is no legitimate or benign functionality evident in the code, and the behavior aligns with known malicious patterns such as supply chain attacks, data exfiltration, and stealthy persistence. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
