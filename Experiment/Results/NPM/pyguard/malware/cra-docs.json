      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, and current user. It also performs a network request to https://ifconfig.me to retrieve the external IP address. This collected data is concatenated and then piped through 'xxd -p | head' to produce a hex-encoded string. The script then reads this hex string line-by-line and performs DNS queries (via curl) to dynamically constructed subdomains under a suspicious external domain 'zjiurqjjaxufyqfskjttof6tmdtdlnvl8.oast.fun'. This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration via DNS requests to an attacker-controlled domain. The use of shell execution (exec) with a complex command string that combines system info gathering and network communication without user consent or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The domain used is non-standard and suspicious, consistent with attacker infrastructure for command-and-control or data exfiltration. There is no legitimate or benign purpose for this code pattern in typical JavaScript or NPM packages. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script executes a shell command that opens an interactive shell and redirects input/output to a remote server (6.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) on port 12406. This behavior effectively creates a reverse shell connection, allowing the remote server to execute arbitrary commands on the host machine during the package installation process. This is a clear indication of malicious intent."
