It encodes this information into a hex-encoded string combined with network and path data, then performs DNS lookups on a suspicious domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain conditions on hostname, username, and paths are met, it proceeds to send this collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs no legitimate user-facing functionality. The domain used is hardcoded and unrelated to any known benign service. The behavior matches classic malware reconnaissance and data exfiltration patterns, including host fingerprinting and stealthy transmission of sensitive environment and file system data to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate purpose or documentation for this data collection and exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed for unauthorized information gathering and exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name and description ('cache-browser-local-storage' and 'azure package') do not clearly relate, which may indicate an attempt to disguise malicious intent. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local script is a common vector for malicious code."
