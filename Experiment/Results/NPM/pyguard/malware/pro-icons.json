It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cm1ffd52vtc0000xz900gkyzzsoyyyyyb.oast.fun) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The domain used is non-standard and appears to be an attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for exfiltration or testing. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering detailed host environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with reconnaissance and data theft malware. There is no legitimate or documented purpose for this data collection and transmission in typical package code, and no error handling or user notification is present. Therefore, this code is malicious."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
