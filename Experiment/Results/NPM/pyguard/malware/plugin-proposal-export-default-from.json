      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data. It then sends this information silently to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs these network communications conditionally based on hostname, user, and path checks that appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns, as it profiles the host environment and exfiltrates sensitive system and user data to an attacker-controlled server without consent. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of obfuscated hex encoding, silent network communication, and conditional execution to avoid certain hosts further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-proposal-export-default-from' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to any known official package, and the description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated to the package name, which may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package. The absence of author information and the presence of a preinstall script are common red flags for malicious behavior."
