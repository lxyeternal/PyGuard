      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname, path, and username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection or transmission. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding of sensitive environment data, and exfiltration to a suspicious external server is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The absence of error logging, user consent, and the use of a suspicious hardcoded domain for data transmission further confirms malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
