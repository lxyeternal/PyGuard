It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (yary8p9i52onnskm37tv1qp85.canarytokens.com), which is a suspicious endpoint commonly used for detecting or triggering alerts in security testing but can also be abused for data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an intent to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded server without consent is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior, consistent with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
