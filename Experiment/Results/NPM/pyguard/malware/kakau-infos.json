      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to steal sensitive Discord user information and potentially exfiltrate it to an attacker. It programmatically collects a wide range of private data from a user's Discord account using their token, including username, email, phone number, billing/payment sources, friend lists, guilds, application/bot tokens, and even multi-factor authentication backup codes. It also collects IP geolocation data via a third-party service. The code does this without any user consent or notification, and is structured in a way that is typical of credential-stealing malware. The use of hardcoded Discord API endpoints, automated data harvesting, and the potential for exfiltration (not shown in this snippet, but implied by the data collection) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches known Discord token grabbers and information stealers, which are widely recognized as malware.",
