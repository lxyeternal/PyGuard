It also attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote host via a Python one-liner that creates a socket and spawns a shell. The collected data is serialized into JSON and sent via an HTTPS POST request to an external, hardcoded endpoint (eoi9eva5ggrnjta.m.pipedream.net) without any user consent or notification. The presence of commented-out code for a direct bash reverse shell and the active Python reverse shell command indicate attempts to gain remote control over the host. This combination of reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and remote shell spawning is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, consistent with credential theft, system compromise, and unauthorized remote access. The code lacks any legitimate user-facing functionality, error handling, or transparency, further confirming its malicious intent."
