It serializes this data into JSON, URL-encodes it, and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (qpjw7bvg5ov51rua11o4fv7lnct3ht5i.oastify.com) without any user consent or notification. The domain appears to be a non-standard, attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for out-of-band interaction or exfiltration testing. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently and does not perform any error handling or logging, indicating an intent to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering host-specific and user-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
