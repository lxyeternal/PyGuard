It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of system and user identity information without any user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The code runs automatically upon import or execution without any user interaction or legitimate purpose, and there is no error handling or logging to inform the user of this data transmission. Collecting and exfiltrating host-specific information in this manner is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during installation, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'angklarjs' and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggest it might be attempting a dependency confusion attack, where a malicious package is published with a name similar to a legitimate package to trick users or automated systems into installing it. Without the content of 'new.js', the exact behavior cannot be confirmed, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a common vector for malicious activity."
