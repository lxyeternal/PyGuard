      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, DNS servers, current directory, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names that are sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known for use in security testing and often abused for exfiltration. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The code performs these network communications silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealthy data exfiltration. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and user data, encoding it, and transmitting it to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code for such behavior, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, environment reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration."
