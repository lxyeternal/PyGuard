      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code performs multiple DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names derived from system info, which is a known technique for covert data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The isValid function attempts to exclude certain hostnames or paths, likely to evade detection or avoid running in analysis environments. The network communication is done silently with suppressed error handling and no user interaction. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding, and exfiltration to a suspicious external domain strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with malware or supply chain attack code."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process without any clear reason or verification. Such behavior is commonly used by malicious packages to run harmful scripts on the user's system during installation. Additionally, the package claims to be an 'azure package' but has no author or legitimate metadata, which further raises suspicion."
