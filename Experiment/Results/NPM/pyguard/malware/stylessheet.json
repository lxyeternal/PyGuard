      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. While it appears to be a mostly standard (albeit minified) jQuery library, there is a critical modification in the b.fn.end function. The end function is overridden as an async function that, when called, performs an AJAX GET request to the URL 'https://ns.api-system.engineer/?key=' concatenated with a hex-encoded version of the serialized contents of the first <form> element on the page. This means that whenever the .end() method is called on a jQuery object, the code will silently exfiltrate all form data from the page to an external, hardcoded, suspicious domain (ns.api-system.engineer) without user consent or notification. This is a classic data exfiltration technique and is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it abuses a common API in a popular library to leak sensitive user data (such as login credentials, personal information, etc.) to an attacker-controlled server. This modification is stealthy and would be difficult for most users or developers to notice, making it a supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is standard jQuery, but this single modification is sufficient to classify the code as malicious.",

The most critical indicator is the override of the jQuery.fn.end function with an async function that, when called, sends a GET request to the external URL 'https://ns.api-system.engineer/?key=' concatenated with a hex-encoded version of the serialized contents of all <form> elements on the page. This is done silently, without user interaction or consent, and exfiltrates potentially sensitive user data (such as login credentials, personal information, etc.) to a suspicious, non-standard domain. The use of hex encoding for the data is a mild obfuscation technique. This pattern matches several high-risk and critical-risk indicators: exfiltration of sensitive information to a hardcoded external URL, lack of user notification or consent, use of a suspicious domain, and execution of the behavior as a side effect of a common jQuery method (end), which could be triggered in normal application code without the developer's awareness. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, as it hijacks a widely used library function to perform data theft. The rest of the code is a mostly standard (though slightly mismatched version) of jQuery, but the malicious override is a clear and severe compromise.",
