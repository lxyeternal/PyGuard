      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user and system information without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The code runs immediately upon import or execution without any user interaction or legitimate purpose, and there is no error handling or logging to inform the user of this data transmission. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized network communication, and exfiltration of user identity and environment data to an attacker-controlled external service."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during installation, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'anaularjs' is a typo-squatting attempt on the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository and author information point to a user named 'serialfuzzer', which may indicate this is a test or malicious package designed to exploit or demonstrate supply chain attacks."
