      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated, using multiple layers of encoded strings, dynamic function generation, and eval calls. Such obfuscation is a classic hallmark of malicious code aiming to evade static analysis and hide its true intent. The code includes dynamic decoding and execution of payloads, which is a strong indicator of malware behavior. The obfuscation prevents straightforward understanding, but the presence of eval with decoded strings, complex string manipulations, and lack of any legitimate or user-facing functionality strongly suggests that the code is designed to execute hidden or unauthorized actions. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious JavaScript/NPM code, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and absence of benign application logic. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
