It then serializes this data into JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (c7kxnys58daceezcxx0jjstn6ec50vok.oastify.com), which is not a known legitimate service. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration of host-specific information to an attacker-controlled server without notification or authorization. The domain name appears random and is likely used for command-and-control or reconnaissance purposes. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection or transmission. The code lacks error handling beyond basic logging and does not perform any authentication or validation. This pattern is a strong hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and exfiltration activity, consistent with malware behavior."
