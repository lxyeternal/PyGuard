It serializes this data into JSON, then URL-encodes it and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (\"cdthh0c2vtc0000wmw9ggg7eaoeyyyyyb.oast.fun\") without any user consent or notification. The domain appears to be a non-standard, attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for exfiltration or command-and-control. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. This pattern of silently gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded suspicious server is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
