It then sends this sensitive system and user information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://468w6vtzmydqseopu3lrlwh6nxtphf54.oastify.com). This behavior matches a classic pattern of reconnaissance and data exfiltration commonly observed in malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The immediate sending of sensitive environment data to an unknown external endpoint without user notification or consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a dependency on itself ('system-info-sender'), which is highly suspicious and can lead to recursive or unintended behavior. Additionally, the 'postinstall' script runs 'node index.js' automatically after installation, which could execute code that sends system information to a local server without user consent. This combination suggests potential malicious intent to exfiltrate system data silently."
