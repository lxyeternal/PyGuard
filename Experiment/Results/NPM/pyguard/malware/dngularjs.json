It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user and system information without any user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The code runs immediately upon import or execution without any user interaction or legitimate purpose, further confirming its malicious nature. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the pattern matches known malware behavior of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'dngularjs' and keywords like 'dependency_confusion' suggest it might be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. Without the content of 'new.js', it is impossible to fully verify, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom JS file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
