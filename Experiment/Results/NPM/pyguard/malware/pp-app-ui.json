It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (457nncjwca0kk7d90nepiyp5nwtnhh56.oastify.com), which is a known pattern for data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging for the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host-specific information and silently exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft behavior. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints, and lack of legitimate user-facing functionality."
