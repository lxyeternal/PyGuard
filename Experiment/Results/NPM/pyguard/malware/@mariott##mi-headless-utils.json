      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, OS type, OS version, release, and user info (username and home directory). It then constructs a message containing this sensitive system and user data along with package name and version information derived from command-line arguments. This message is serialized to JSON and sent via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic explaining this data collection and exfiltration. The code disables SSL certificate verification (rejectUnauthorized: false), which weakens security and may facilitate interception or man-in-the-middle attacks. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL used for exfiltrating sensitive host and user information without consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behavior of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure, commonly seen in supply chain attacks or malicious post-install scripts. There is no error handling or logging, indicating an attempt to operate stealthily. Therefore, this code is malicious as it performs unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive system and user information to an external endpoint."
