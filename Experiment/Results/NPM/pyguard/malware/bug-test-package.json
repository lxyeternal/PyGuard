      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated logic that collects environment variables (process.env) and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external host (https://76c42f27d26091659dca820a37e6f5d3/bug-test-package). The obfuscation uses hex-encoded strings and array indexing to hide the actual strings, which is a common evasion technique. The code performs this data exfiltration silently without user consent or notification, and the message logged ('Если вы видите это сообщение, сообщите безопасникам' - 'If you see this message, report to security') suggests awareness of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality associated with this network communication. The pattern of reading environment variables and immediately sending them to an external, suspicious endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with credential or configuration data theft. The absence of error handling and the direct network POST followed by a return statement further support the conclusion that this code is designed for stealthy data exfiltration."
