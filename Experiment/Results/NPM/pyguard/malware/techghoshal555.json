It then serializes this data into JSON and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (eo68t6hwethv4lo.m.pipedream.net), which is a suspicious endpoint commonly used for capturing exfiltrated data. There is no error handling, logging, or legitimate user-facing functionality, indicating stealthy data exfiltration. The combination of gathering host-specific information and transmitting it externally without user knowledge or consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and is rarely, if ever, justified in benign software."
