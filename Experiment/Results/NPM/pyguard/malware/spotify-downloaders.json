      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated, using multiple layers of indirection, encoded strings, and confusing variable names, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. It imports network-related modules such as 'got' and 'form-data', and performs HTTP requests to external endpoints with dynamically constructed headers and payloads. The code includes functions named 'getAccessToken', 'search', and 'track' that interact with external services, likely to retrieve and exfiltrate data. The obfuscation and dynamic string decoding patterns strongly resemble those used in malware to evade detection. There is no indication of legitimate user interaction or transparent functionality. The code also constructs authorization headers and sends requests with potentially sensitive data. Given the combination of obfuscation, network communication to external endpoints, dynamic code execution patterns, and lack of legitimate purpose or documentation, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including potential credential theft, data exfiltration, and remote code execution."
