It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (eos075yf4hbqpp9.m.pipedream.net), which is a suspicious third-party service often used for capturing exfiltrated data. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic explaining this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently and writes the data immediately upon execution, indicating stealthy exfiltration. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to an external, hardcoded server without user consent or legitimate purpose."
