It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). The data exfiltration occurs silently without user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs network communication to an attacker-controlled server, which is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration, indicating that the code is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Additionally, the package has no author information and a vague description, which are common red flags. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
