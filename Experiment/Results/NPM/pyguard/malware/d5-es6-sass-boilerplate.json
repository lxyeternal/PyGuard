It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (drsnh1.000webhostapp.com) without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with error handling suppressing any errors, and the response data is written to standard output without further processing. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and transmitting it externally without user interaction or legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration. The hardcoded external endpoint, lack of user-facing functionality, absence of error logging, and direct network communication to an unknown server strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package has a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package depends on itself ('d5-es6-sass-boilerplate' depends on 'd5-es6-sass-boilerplate' with a different version), which is unusual and may be an attempt to cause dependency confusion or recursive installs. Without the content of 'index.js', the exact behavior cannot be determined, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
