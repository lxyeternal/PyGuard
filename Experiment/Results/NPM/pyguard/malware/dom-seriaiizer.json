      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious behavior pattern: it imports the 'child_process' module and immediately executes a shell command that downloads an executable from a shortened URL (https://bit.ly/3c2tMTT) using 'wget', saves it as a hidden file './.cmc', sets executable permissions, and runs it silently with all output redirected to /dev/null. This sequence is a classic hallmark of malware that retrieves and executes a potentially untrusted payload from a remote source without user consent or notification. The command is executed at module load time, meaning it runs automatically when the package is imported, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious NPM packages. There is no legitimate or documented reason for this behavior in an HTTP error handling library, and it bypasses any user interaction or error handling, indicating intent to stealthily deploy and execute malicious code. This direct coupling of network retrieval and shell execution, especially with a hidden file and silent execution, is a strong indicator of malicious intent and poses a critical security risk."
