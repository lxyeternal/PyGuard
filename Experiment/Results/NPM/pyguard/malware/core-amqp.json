      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or notification. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed domain names based on the collected data, which is a form of covert data exfiltration. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in analysis environments. The data collected includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents from system and user folders, which is not justified by any legitimate functionality. There is no error logging or user consent, and the network communication is stealthy and directed to a suspicious external server. These behaviors align with typical malware patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration, indicating malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
