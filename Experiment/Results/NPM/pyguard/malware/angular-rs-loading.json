      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information such as the home directory, current directory, username, and hostname, and sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (94.23.18.98) without any user consent or notification. The request is made silently with no error logging or user interaction, indicating an intent to stealthily exfiltrate environment information. This pattern of gathering host-specific data and transmitting it externally without legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. The code lacks any benign functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection, and the use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a known or trusted domain further increases suspicion. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. Overall, this behavior aligns with known malicious patterns of information stealing and potential preparation for further exploitation or targeted attacks."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase without any clear reason or documentation. Such behavior is commonly used to run malicious scripts or compromise the environment during package installation."
