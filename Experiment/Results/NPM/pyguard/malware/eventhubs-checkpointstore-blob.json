It encodes this data into a custom format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml), which is suspicious and not related to any legitimate service. The code performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed domain names derived from local system data, indicating potential covert communication or tracking. The isValid function attempts to exclude certain known hostnames or paths, suggesting evasion or targeting logic. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and exfiltration. The use of try/catch blocks to suppress errors around file system access and network calls further indicates stealth. The overall behavior matches known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure, consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
