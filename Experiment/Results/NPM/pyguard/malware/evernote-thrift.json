It then encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS GET request to a hardcoded external endpoint (3f35113f41feee80a601db01b48dc963.m.pipedream.net) without any user consent, notification, or legitimate purpose. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, specifically automated data exfiltration of host-specific information to an attacker-controlled server. The absence of error handling, user interaction, or any benign business logic further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious and intended for reconnaissance and data theft."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', it is impossible to rule out malicious behavior. The description 'testing @ hackerone' might indicate a security test, but the presence of a preinstall script that executes code is a common vector for malicious activity."
