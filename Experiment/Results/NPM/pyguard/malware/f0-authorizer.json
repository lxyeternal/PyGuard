It serializes this data into JSON, URL-encodes it, and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (qpjw7bvg5ov51rua11o4fv7lnct3ht5i.oastify.com) without any user consent or notification. The domain appears to be an attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing or exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently and writes the response data to standard output, indicating stealthy exfiltration behavior. This pattern of gathering host-specific and user-specific environment data and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded endpoint is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system without explicit consent. Since the 'index.js' file is not provided, its contents are unknown, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
