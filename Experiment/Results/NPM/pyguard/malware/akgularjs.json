      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive host and user information without any user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused by malware authors for stealthy data collection and command-and-control communication. The code runs automatically upon import (immediately invoked async function), with no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling beyond logging network errors, further indicating stealth and malicious design. There is no benign justification for collecting and sending this combination of system and user data to an external Discord webhook silently. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Additionally, the package name 'akgularjs' is a typo-squatting variant of 'angularjs', and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository and author information point to a user named 'serialfuzzer', which may indicate this is a test or research package for fuzzing or security testing, but in a real environment, such behavior is considered malicious."
