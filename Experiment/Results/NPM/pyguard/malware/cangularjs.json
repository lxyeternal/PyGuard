It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of system and user identity information without any user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data collection and command-and-control communication. The code runs automatically upon import or execution without any legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling that would indicate benign use. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, external data exfiltration, and use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'cangularjs' is similar to the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be attempting a dependency confusion attack. The repository URL points to a user named 'serialfuzzer', which may indicate this is a test or malicious package designed to exploit trust in similarly named packages."
