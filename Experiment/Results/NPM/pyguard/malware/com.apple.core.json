It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (a subdomain of burpcollaborator.net), which is commonly used for testing and detecting data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host-specific information and exfiltrating it silently to an attacker-controlled external server without consent is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, use of suspicious hardcoded endpoints, and lack of legitimate user-facing functionality."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to run malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'com.apple.core' mimics an official Apple package, which is a common tactic to deceive users. The combination of a misleading package name and a preinstall script that runs code makes this package potentially malicious."
