This domain is unrelated to any legitimate package repository or known service. The code silently checks if the response status is 200 and logs a success message without any user interaction or consent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality associated with this network call. The use of a suspicious domain, combined with network communication during package installation or initialization, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance or potential command-and-control (C2) communication. The code lacks error handling beyond logging and does not perform any benign operations, suggesting it is designed to stealthily verify connectivity to an attacker-controlled server. This pattern aligns with known malware behaviors involving external network communication to suspicious endpoints without user knowledge or consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node app.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts on the user's machine without explicit consent. Additionally, the 'main' field is set to 'node app.js', which is not a valid entry point (it should be a file path, not a command), indicating possible obfuscation or misuse. The package name '@zettle-bo/react-router-dom' mimics a popular package name, which could be an attempt to trick users into installing it."
