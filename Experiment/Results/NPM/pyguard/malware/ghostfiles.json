This pattern matches classic data exfiltration techniques observed in malware: (1) arbitrary file access, (2) immediate transmission to an attacker-controlled server, and (3) lack of user notification or legitimate business logic. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate domain and the absence of any validation, user prompts, or clear legitimate purpose strongly indicate malicious intent. This code could be used to steal sensitive files from a victim's machine and exfiltrate them to a remote attacker, which is a hallmark of information-stealing malware.",
