      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, platform type, user info, and current working directory without any user consent or notification. It then serializes and encrypts this data and encodes it in base64. Subsequently, it sends this encoded, encrypted system information to an external, hardcoded URL (https://kotko.me) via an HTTP GET request with query parameters constructed from package-related strings and the encoded data. This behavior is a classic example of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. The code also writes a seemingly innocuous file ('pocByKotko.txt') which may be a decoy or proof of concept marker. The presence of encryption and base64 encoding before exfiltration suggests an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The external domain is unrelated to any known benign service, increasing suspicion. The code lacks error handling or logging for the network operation, indicating stealth. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious scripts and dependency declarations that indicate potentially malicious behavior. Specifically, the 'preinstall' script runs 'npm i request --save-dev', which installs the 'request' package during installation, potentially modifying the environment unexpectedly. The 'postinstall' and 'test' scripts both run 'node index.js', which could execute arbitrary code during installation or testing phases. Additionally, the dependencies are inconsistently declared: 'Dependencies' (capitalized) contains packages, but the standard field 'dependencies' is empty, which is unusual and may be an attempt to hide actual dependencies. The presence of core Node.js modules like 'crypto' and 'os' as dependencies is suspicious since these are built-in modules and should not be installed via npm. Overall, these factors suggest the package is designed to execute code during installation and may perform unauthorized actions."
