      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this information into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user identity data to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. The code runs immediately upon import (asynchronously invoked), performs no legitimate user-facing function, and lacks any error handling or user interaction to justify this behavior. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL used for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, such direct collection and exfiltration of user and environment information to an external webhook is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during installation, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'angjlarjs' is a typo-squatting variant of the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository and author information point to a GitHub user known for security research or fuzzing, but the combination of these factors strongly indicates potential malicious intent."
