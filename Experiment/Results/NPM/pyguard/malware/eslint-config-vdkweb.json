      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package metadata. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (kj7mxhpsk63x1bbkgmoatkh3nutlhc51.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's stated purpose. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating stealth. The domain used is similar to known testing or exfiltration endpoints (e.g., burpcollaborator.net) often abused for malicious data exfiltration. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft malware. The absence of legitimate business logic, combined with direct network exfiltration of sensitive environment and user data, classifies this code as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js.' which is suspicious because it executes a JavaScript file before installation. The filename 'index.js.' (with a trailing dot) is unusual and may be an attempt to execute hidden or malicious code. Without the content of 'index.js.', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but running arbitrary code during preinstall is a common vector for malicious activity."
