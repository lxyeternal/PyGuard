It then encodes this data into a custom hex-based format combined with network interface information and constructs DNS query strings. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries and sends the collected system data via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname, path, and username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding of sensitive environment data, and exfiltration to a suspicious external server strongly indicates malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-block-scoping' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to known legitimate packages, and the description 'azure package' is vague. The lack of author information and the presence of a preinstall script without clear purpose are red flags indicating potential malicious behavior."
