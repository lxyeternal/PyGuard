It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname, path, and username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for sending detailed host fingerprinting and file system data is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The absence of error logging, user notification, or any benign purpose, combined with the hardcoded suspicious domain and the nature of the collected data, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with information-stealing or backdoor reconnaissance behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to perform malicious actions such as stealing data, modifying files, or installing malware. Additionally, the package name 'to-primitive' and version '99.10.9' are unusual and may be attempting to impersonate a legitimate package. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise suspicion."
