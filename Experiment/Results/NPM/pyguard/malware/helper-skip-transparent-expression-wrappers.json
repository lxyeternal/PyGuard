      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation of hostname, path, and username, which appears designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the data collection. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for transmitting sensitive environment and file system data is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The absence of error logging, user notification, and the stealthy nature of the network communication strongly indicate malicious intent. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized system fingerprinting and exfiltration of sensitive information to an external server, which is a malicious behavior."

The 'index.js' file is not provided, so its contents are unknown, which raises a risk that it could contain malicious code executed automatically when the package is installed."
