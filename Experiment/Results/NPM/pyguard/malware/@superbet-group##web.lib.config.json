      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (207.154.222.173) on port 80, which is a suspicious indicator. It constructs the request path dynamically by appending the local machine's hostname and platform information (os.hostname() and os.platform) as query parameters, effectively exfiltrating system-specific information without user consent or notification. The code lacks any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. It also does not perform any authentication, input validation, or error handling beyond basic logging, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The combination of gathering host-specific information and sending it to a hardcoded external IP address without user interaction or clear purpose is a strong hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. Although the code does not execute downloaded code or spawn shells, the pattern of collecting system info and sending it to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a recognized malicious behavior pattern."
