It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from system data, which is a common reconnaissance and exfiltration technique. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. The data exfiltration to an external, suspicious domain combined with the collection of sensitive environment and file system information, lack of legitimate user-facing functionality, and absence of error logging or user notification are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or spyware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
