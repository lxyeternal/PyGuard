It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (a subdomain of burpcollaborator.net), which is commonly used for testing or simulating exfiltration in security contexts. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering host-specific and user-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external, suspicious endpoint without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is strongly associated with malware and is a critical risk indicator of malicious activity."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares a dependency on itself ('surf-sharekit-frontend' at version '^9.9.7'), which is unusual and can cause recursive or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js' before installation, which can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', this is suspicious and potentially malicious. The 'test' script is a non-standard string and does not perform any testing, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the self-dependency combined with a preinstall script executing code is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes."
