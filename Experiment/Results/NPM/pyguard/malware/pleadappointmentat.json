This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious because it causes the package installation process to make an unsolicited network request, which could be used to exfiltrate data, download malicious payloads, or perform other harmful actions. Additionally, the dependency 'pleadappointmentat' with version '<99.0.0' referencing itself is unusual and may be an attempt to confuse or cause dependency resolution issues."
