      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused by malware authors for stealthy data collection. Additionally, the code executes immediately upon import (via an immediately invoked async function), performing this data collection and exfiltration silently, without any legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling beyond logging network errors. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, and use of hardcoded external endpoints for communication."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'repactjs' and keywords like 'dependency_confusion' suggest it might be attempting a dependency confusion attack. The repository URL points to a suspicious or unrelated project named 'AngulerJS' by 'serialfuzzer', which further raises concerns about the package's legitimacy."
