It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The isValid function attempts to exclude certain hostnames and paths, likely to evade detection or analysis environments. The overall behavior is consistent with host fingerprinting and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The hardcoded external domain, combined with the automated collection and exfiltration of sensitive system information, strongly indicates malicious intent."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm if it is malicious, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
