It serializes this data into JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (\"cddap002vtc0000w57sgggsimyyyyyyyb.oast.fun\") over HTTPS. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and exfiltration. The domain used is non-standard and appears attacker-controlled, consistent with command-and-control or data exfiltration infrastructure. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and transmitting it externally without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
