It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names targeting a suspicious hardcoded domain (interactsh.com), which is known for use in security testing and malicious command-and-control (C2) operations. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, effectively leaking system fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends a POST request containing the serialized system information to the same suspicious external domain over HTTPS without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is stealthy, with error handling suppressing any network errors and no logging or user interaction. The domain used is not related to the package's stated purpose and is hardcoded, indicating intent to communicate with an attacker-controlled server. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive environment data, DNS exfiltration, and HTTP POST to an external suspicious domain without user knowledge or legitimate purpose is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'azure-keyvault-secrets-js' and description 'azure whitehat package' may be attempting to impersonate a legitimate Azure package to gain trust. The absence of author information and the unusual version number '99.10.9' further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
