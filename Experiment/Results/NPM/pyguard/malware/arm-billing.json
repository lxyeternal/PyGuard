      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths without user consent. It encodes this data into a custom hex-based format combined with network and environment details, then constructs DNS queries and sends an HTTP POST request containing this sensitive information to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS. The code suppresses errors silently, performs network communication without user interaction or notification, and uses multiple heuristics to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. This behavior matches classic malware reconnaissance and data exfiltration patterns, where host fingerprinting and environment data are stealthily gathered and transmitted to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation justifying this data collection and exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded suspicious domain, silent error handling, and direct outbound network communication with encoded system data strongly indicates malicious intent."
