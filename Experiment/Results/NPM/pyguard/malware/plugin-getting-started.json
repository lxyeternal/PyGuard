      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, package version, and the entire package.json content. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (a subdomain of oastify.com, which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing and can be abused for data exfiltration). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled endpoint without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints, and lack of legitimate user-facing functionality."
