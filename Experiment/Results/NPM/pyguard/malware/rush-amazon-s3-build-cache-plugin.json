It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The isValid function attempts to exclude certain hostnames and paths, likely to evade detection or analysis environments. The overall behavior is consistent with host fingerprinting and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The hardcoded external domain, the collection of sensitive environment and system data, and the immediate network exfiltration without user interaction or consent are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has no author information, a vague description ('azbit package'), and a very high version number (99.10.9), which are often indicators of a potentially untrustworthy or malicious package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a red flag for malicious intent."
