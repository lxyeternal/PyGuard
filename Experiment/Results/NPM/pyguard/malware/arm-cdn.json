      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or test environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding of sensitive environment data, and transmission to an external server is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The use of DNS lookups on encoded queries further suggests covert communication or command-and-control techniques. There is no benign justification for this behavior in typical package code, and the hardcoded suspicious domain and stealthy data collection strongly indicate malicious intent."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
