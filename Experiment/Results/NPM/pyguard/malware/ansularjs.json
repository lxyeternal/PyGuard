      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user and system information without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The code runs automatically upon import or execution without any user interaction or legitimate purpose, further confirming its malicious nature. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is minimal and obfuscated in style, consistent with malware patterns. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized reconnaissance and exfiltration of system information to an attacker-controlled external server, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Additionally, the package name 'ansularjs' and repository URL 'AngulerJS' appear to be typos or attempts to mimic popular packages (like AngularJS), which is a common tactic in dependency confusion or typosquatting attacks. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further suggests this package is designed to exploit such vulnerabilities."
