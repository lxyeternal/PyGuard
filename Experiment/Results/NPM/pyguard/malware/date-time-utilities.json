      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication only if certain environment conditions are met (via isValid function), which appears to be an evasion technique. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The use of DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from system info further indicates covert data exfiltration attempts. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. The hardcoded suspicious domain, silent error handling, and direct transmission of sensitive host data to an external server without consent strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with malware performing host fingerprinting and data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package has an unusually high version number (99.10.9) and a vague description ('azure package') with no author information, which are common signs of a potentially malicious or untrustworthy package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a red flag."
