It then encodes this data in hexadecimal and exfiltrates it via DNS queries to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain (oastify.com). This pattern of gathering sensitive system and network information and transmitting it covertly to an external domain is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The use of DNS queries for data exfiltration is a known stealth technique to bypass network monitoring. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging for network operations, indicating an intent to avoid detection. Based on the provided knowledge points, this behavior is strongly associated with malware performing host fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration."
