      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data. It then sends this information silently to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs these network communications conditionally based on hostname, user, and path checks that appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns, as it profiles the host environment and exfiltrates sensitive system and user data to an attacker-controlled server without consent. The absence of legitimate user-facing functionality, combined with stealthy network communication to a suspicious external domain, strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code during package installation, potentially leading to malicious actions if 'index.js' contains harmful code. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively say it is malicious, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
