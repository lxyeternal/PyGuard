It then encodes this information into a hex string and exfiltrates it by performing DNS queries to dynamically constructed subdomains under the domain 'pocbb.com', which is a suspicious, hardcoded external domain unrelated to any legitimate package functionality. The code also includes environment checks to avoid running in certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. The use of DNS resolution for data exfiltration is a known covert channel technique used by malware to bypass network monitoring. There is no legitimate user-facing purpose or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The absence of error handling or logging for network operations further indicates stealth. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of automated system reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration, making this code malicious."
