      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains scripts that execute curl commands during 'preinstall' and 'test' phases. These commands send sensitive environment information such as the current username (via 'whoami'), current working directory (via 'pwd'), and the fully qualified hostname (via 'hostname -f') to an external URL (https://eokxi6shvostsan.m.pipedream.net/datacamp). This behavior leaks potentially sensitive system information to a third party without user consent, which is considered malicious. Additionally, the package depends on itself ('rdocumentation-workers'), which is unusual and may be an attempt to confuse dependency resolution."
