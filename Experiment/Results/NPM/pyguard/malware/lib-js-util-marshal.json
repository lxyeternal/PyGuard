      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in a custom hex-based format combined with network interface information and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data. It then sends this data silently to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs these network communications conditionally based on hostname, user, and path checks that appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns, as it profiles the host environment and exfiltrates sensitive system and user information to an attacker-controlled server without consent. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of obfuscated encoding, silent network communication, and conditional execution to avoid certain hosts strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
