      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes multiple shell commands to collect sensitive system information, including private IP addresses, current user identity, hostname, current working directory, contents of /etc/passwd, and directory listing. It then serializes this sensitive data into JSON and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (eo56j4tfa20w1b7.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior matches classic data exfiltration patterns commonly associated with malware. The code lacks error handling or logging, indicating an intent to operate stealthily. The collection of sensitive system files and user information combined with network exfiltration to an attacker-controlled domain is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code during package installation, potentially leading to malicious actions. Additionally, the description field 'Hacked By Nova' and author 'Nova Security' suggest possible tampering or malicious intent. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom node script is a common vector for malicious code execution."
