      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches data from a hardcoded external URL (https://banana.stand.ne1.yahoo.com/html_001.html) without any user interaction or notification. It then base64 encodes the entire fetched content and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external endpoint (f5778d1d81cc30c39dcdd0da5ca1d49a.m.pipedream.net), which is a known service often used for capturing and analyzing exfiltrated data. This pattern of retrieving remote content, encoding it, and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent or legitimate purpose is a classic indicator of malicious data exfiltration behavior. The code lacks any legitimate business logic, user-facing functionality, or error handling that would justify such network communication. The use of base64 encoding before transmission is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. The hardcoded suspicious external endpoints and the direct data exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent."
