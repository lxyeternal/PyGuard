      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and file listings from root and common drive directories. It encodes this data into a custom hex-based format combined with network and path information, then constructs DNS queries and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain environment conditions are met (via isValid function), it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment details and file paths, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data theft. The code suppresses errors silently, uses hardcoded suspicious domains, and performs network communication immediately upon module execution, indicating stealthy behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. These factors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, consistent with malware or supply chain attack behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
