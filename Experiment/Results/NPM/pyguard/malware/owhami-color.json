      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and uses dynamic string decoding to hide its intent. It imports modules such as 'glob', 'fs', 'https', 'child_process', and 'axios', which are commonly used for file system operations, network requests, and process execution. The code enumerates directories under the user's local application data folder, specifically targeting paths that include 'Discord' variants, indicating it is searching for Discord client installations. It then uses the 'glob' module to find files matching certain patterns within these directories. The function 'Infect' downloads a payload from a hardcoded external HTTPS URL and writes this payload into the discovered Discord-related files, replacing certain placeholders with hardcoded webhook URLs. This behavior is consistent with injecting malicious code or backdoors into Discord client files. Additionally, the code sends HTTP POST requests to Discord webhook URLs with information about the infected files, effectively exfiltrating data to attacker-controlled endpoints. The code also executes shell commands and performs file writes without user consent or notification. The combination of obfuscation, targeting user-specific application data directories, injecting code into Discord client files, and exfiltrating data to hardcoded Discord webhooks is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with credential theft, backdoor installation, or malware propagation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
