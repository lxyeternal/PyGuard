      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including package name, directory path, user's home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package version. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (en92vjbwv3304va.m.pipedream.net), which is a suspicious third-party service often used for capturing exfiltrated data. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic explaining this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Additionally, the description 'don't install for poc purposes' suggests the package may be a proof of concept potentially containing harmful or experimental code. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious activity."
