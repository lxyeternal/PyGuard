It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cjtdt1g2vtc0000vsxhggjpg7yhyyyyyb.oast.fun) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The domain used is non-standard and appears to be an attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for exfiltration or testing of data leaks. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data collection and transmission. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, specifically automated data exfiltration of sensitive environment and user information to an external, hardcoded, suspicious server. Therefore, this code is malicious."

This is suspicious because preinstall scripts execute automatically during npm install, potentially running arbitrary code without user consent. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is risky and often used to execute malicious payloads or compromise the environment."
