      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a class named 'yapgdkoqjecnrhkzMiner' which appears to be a wrapper for launching a native executable miner binary named 'yapgdkoqjecnrhkz' or 'yapgdkoqjecnrhkz.exe' depending on the platform. The miner executable is stored in the same directory as the script, with obfuscated, random-looking filenames. The code sets execution permissions on the Linux binary and then spawns the miner process without any user interaction or notification. It also dynamically writes a configuration file 'config.json' by merging a base config with application-provided pool and GPU settings, which is typical for cryptocurrency miners. The class exposes start and stop methods to control the miner process. This pattern is consistent with cryptocurrency mining malware, which often bundles or downloads native miner binaries with obfuscated names and runs them silently. The lack of transparency, obfuscated filenames, and spawning of a native miner executable without user consent or clear documentation strongly indicate malicious behavior. The code does not perform any legitimate user-facing functionality beyond running the miner, and the miner executable itself is suspicious due to its random name and direct execution. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious cryptocurrency mining malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "This package.json describes a NodeJS Monero miner, which is software designed to mine cryptocurrency (Monero) using the host machine's resources. The presence of a script named 'XMR-TEMP' that runs an executable with mining parameters targeting a Monero pool indicates that the package is intended to perform cryptocurrency mining. Such behavior is often considered malicious or unwanted, especially if installed without the user's explicit consent, as it can consume significant CPU/GPU resources and electricity. Additionally, the 'postinstall' script runs 'npm i' inside the server directory, which could further install dependencies or code that supports the mining operation. Overall, this package is likely designed to mine cryptocurrency on the user's machine, which is a form of malicious behavior if done without clear user consent."
