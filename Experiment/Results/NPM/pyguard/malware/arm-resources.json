      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion techniques to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The code runs automatically upon import or execution, indicating it could be part of a supply chain attack or malicious package. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, making this code malicious."
