      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, and package metadata without any user consent or notification. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS queries to a suspicious hardcoded domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com), which is a known technique for covert data exfiltration via DNS. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. The domain name is hardcoded and unrelated to the package's stated purpose, indicating a command-and-control or data exfiltration endpoint. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling, and the code runs automatically upon import or execution, which is typical of supply chain or malware infection vectors. The combination of gathering sensitive host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an attacker-controlled server is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package name 'eclipse-typescript' and description 'bitfinex whitehat package' do not align with any known legitimate package, which raises further suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
