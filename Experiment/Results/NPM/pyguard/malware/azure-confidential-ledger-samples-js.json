      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It then encodes this data into a custom hex-based format combined with network and path information, constructs DNS query names, and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain conditions on hostname, username, and paths are met (mostly excluding known or local environments), it proceeds to send the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. This behavior constitutes unauthorized system fingerprinting and exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment and file system data without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently, uses hardcoded suspicious domains, and performs network communication immediately upon module execution, all without any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation. These are strong indicators of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration activity consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
