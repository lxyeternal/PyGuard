Then, it reads all files and directories in the current working directory (excluding hidden files and node_modules) and deletes them recursively and synchronously, effectively wiping out the user's project files or any other files in that directory. This destructive behavior is performed silently with suppressed error handling, indicating intent to avoid detection or interruption. Finally, it prints a prank message in ASCII art. The combination of automated git commit and push, followed by mass deletion of files in the working directory, is highly malicious as it causes data loss and potential disruption of the user's work or repository. There is no legitimate user-facing purpose or notification, and the code runs immediately upon execution, which aligns with typical malware or sabotage patterns."
