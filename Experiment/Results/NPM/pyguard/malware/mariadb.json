This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including automated exfiltration of sensitive environment data to an attacker-controlled server, absence of error handling or logging, use of a suspicious hardcoded external endpoint, and no legitimate user-facing functionality. The code silently leaks potentially sensitive system and user environment information, which can include credentials, tokens, or configuration secrets, constituting a serious privacy and security breach. Therefore, this code is malicious."
