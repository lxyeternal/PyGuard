      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a highly suspicious preinstall script: 'preinstall.bat && del preinstall.bat'. This script will execute a batch file named preinstall.bat (if present) before the package is installed, and then immediately delete the batch file. This pattern is a known supply chain attack vector, as it allows arbitrary code execution during installation, potentially without user awareness. The batch file could be created or modified by an attacker to perform malicious actions such as downloading and executing further payloads, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. The immediate deletion of the batch file is a classic evidence-cleanup technique used by malware to evade detection and forensic analysis. This behavior matches several high-risk and critical-risk indicators from the knowledge base, including execution of arbitrary code during installation, evidence cleanup, and lack of user notification or consent. No legitimate package should require a preinstall script that executes and deletes a batch file in this manner.",
