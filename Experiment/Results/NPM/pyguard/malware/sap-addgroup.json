      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that performs a curl request to an external, suspicious domain constructed dynamically using the current system username (`whoami`), hostname (`hostname`), and current working directory (`pwd`). This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent. The use of `exec` to run shell commands combined with sending potentially sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled domain strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling that justifies this network communication, and the domain used is not related to any known benign service. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, system reconnaissance, and remote communication to suspicious endpoints."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts run automatically before package installation, and hiding output is a common tactic to conceal malicious activity. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially malicious as it could execute arbitrary code during installation without the user's knowledge."
