      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname, path, and username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding of sensitive environment data, and transmission to an external, suspicious domain strongly indicates malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware. There is no benign justification for this pattern, especially given the hardcoded suspicious domain, lack of user notification, and stealthy error handling."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
