It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation of hostname, path, and user info, but the default behavior is to send this sensitive information externally. The code suppresses errors silently, uses obfuscated checks, and performs network communication to an attacker-controlled domain, which is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including host fingerprinting, environment reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration to a suspicious external server."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'free-solid-svg-icons' and description 'azure package' do not align, which may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious activity."
