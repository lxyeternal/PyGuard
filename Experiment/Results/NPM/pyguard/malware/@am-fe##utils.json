      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and performs extensive system reconnaissance and data collection without user consent or notification. It collects sensitive environment information including hostname, username, DNS servers, network interfaces (IPv4 and IPv6 addresses), environment variables (notably USERDNSDOMAIN), current working directory, package.json contents, and contents of potentially sensitive files such as Kubernetes config and SSH private key files from the user's home directory. It then makes an HTTPS GET request to an external service (https://ipinfo.io/json) to obtain the external IP address, and upon receiving this data, it compiles all collected information into a JSON object. This JSON object is URL-encoded and sent via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain 'app.threatest.com' on port 443, under the path '/report/'. The code is designed to run only if the script is executed as 'index.js', otherwise it logs a message and does nothing. The obfuscation, the nature of the data collected (including private keys and kubeconfig), and the exfiltration to an external, suspicious domain without any user interaction or consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk patterns such as unauthorized data exfiltration, environment and user profiling, and use of obfuscation to evade detection. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code for such extensive data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code is malicious."
