It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ik6mts6rto1a9jqtaqg06lpwange43.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling is minimal and suppresses errors silently. The domain used resembles those commonly employed for testing exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication in malware. This pattern of gathering detailed host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without user knowledge or legitimate purpose is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script is set to execute 'index.js' directly before installation. This is unusual because 'preinstall' scripts typically run shell commands, not JavaScript files directly. If 'index.js' contains malicious code, it will be executed automatically during the package installation process, potentially leading to harmful effects such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or unauthorized actions. Without the content of 'index.js', this setup is suspicious and could be used to run malicious code stealthily."
