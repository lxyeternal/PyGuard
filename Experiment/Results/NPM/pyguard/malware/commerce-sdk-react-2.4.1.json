      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, platform type, user info, current working directory, and local IP address without any user consent or notification. It then serializes and encrypts this data and encodes it in base64. Subsequently, it sends this encoded, encrypted system fingerprint data to an external, hardcoded, suspicious domain (https://kotko.org) via an HTTP GET request with query parameters constructed from seemingly unrelated strings ('npmjs+salesforcecommercecloud--pwa-kit' and 'commerce-sdk-react'). This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external server without user interaction or legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration. Additionally, the code writes a file named 'ByKotko.txt' with a suspicious message 'this proof for report' which may be a marker or signature for the attacker. The use of encryption and base64 encoding before exfiltration suggests an attempt to obfuscate the data being sent. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The external domain is unrelated to the apparent package or application context, increasing suspicion. The code lacks error handling for the network request, indicating stealth. Taken together, these behaviors strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or a supply chain attack component."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json runs 'node index.js' during both 'preinstall' and 'postinstall' scripts, which is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation. Additionally, the 'preinstall' script runs 'npm i request --save-dev', which is unusual and can lead to unexpected dependency changes during install. The 'index.js' file is not provided, but running it automatically during install is a common vector for malicious behavior. Also, the dependencies section is incorrectly capitalized as 'Dependencies' instead of 'dependencies', which may cause npm to ignore it, potentially hiding the real dependencies or behavior. Overall, the combination of install scripts executing code and unusual dependency management is suspicious and potentially malicious."
