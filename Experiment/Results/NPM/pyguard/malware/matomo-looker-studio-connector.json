This is suspicious because running arbitrary shell scripts during installation can lead to execution of malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the description mentions 'dependency confusion vuln', indicating the package may be designed to exploit dependency confusion vulnerabilities. The author name 'snip3rgg' and the presence of an external script further suggest potential malicious intent."
