      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, package version, and the entire package.json content. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (\"chngh242vtc00008va7gge4aewhyyyyyn.oast.fun\"), which is not related to any legitimate service. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domain used is similar in style to known testing or malicious exfiltration endpoints (e.g., burpcollaborator.net). The code's sole purpose appears to be silent exfiltration of sensitive environment and user data to an attacker-controlled server, which is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft malware. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as gathering host-specific information and transmitting it externally without consent, use of hardcoded suspicious domains, lack of legitimate user-facing functionality, and suppression of errors to maintain stealth."
