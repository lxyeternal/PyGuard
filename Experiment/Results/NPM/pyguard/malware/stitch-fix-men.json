It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ng7pcjydnhoaor1ufwphhrx5fwln9dx2.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling is minimal and suppresses errors silently. The domain used is similar to those commonly employed for testing or malicious exfiltration (e.g., burpcollaborator.net, Interactsh). This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The absence of legitimate business logic or user-facing features, combined with direct network communication to a suspicious endpoint, strongly indicates malicious intent."
