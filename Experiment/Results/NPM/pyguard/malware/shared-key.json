It then encodes this data into a hex-encoded string combined with network and path information, constructs DNS queries, and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). Subsequently, it sends a POST request containing the serialized system information to the same external domain over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code includes multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. The data exfiltration to a hardcoded, non-standard domain, combined with stealthy error suppression and lack of legitimate user-facing functionality, strongly indicates malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware. There is no benign or documented purpose for this extensive system fingerprinting and external communication, making this code malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
