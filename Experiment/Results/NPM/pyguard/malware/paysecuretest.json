      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, package version, and the entire package.json content. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (7mukg52sxzbpv5irw8ilp8709rfh36.oastify.com), which is a non-standard, attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for exfiltration or reconnaissance. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an external server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Additionally, the description explicitly states 'Malicious package by shakti', which is a direct indicator of malicious intent. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', the presence of a preinstall script running a node script combined with the description strongly suggests malicious behavior."
