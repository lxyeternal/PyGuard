This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including automated exfiltration of sensitive environment data to an attacker-controlled server, use of a hardcoded suspicious domain, absence of error handling or logging, and no legitimate user-facing functionality. The immediate transmission of potentially sensitive environment variables to an unknown external endpoint strongly indicates data exfiltration and privacy breach, which is a hallmark of malware or supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
