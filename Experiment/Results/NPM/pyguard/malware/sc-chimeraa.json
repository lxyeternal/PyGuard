      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated, using encoded strings and dynamic function calls, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. It imports core Node.js modules such as 'os', 'fs', 'http', 'https', and 'crypto', and defines functions that compute SHA-256 hashes. The code scans directories and files, comparing file hashes against hardcoded values, indicating it is searching for specific files, likely sensitive or valuable data. It performs asynchronous HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded external URL, sending JSON data that includes system or environment information. The code runs automatically without user interaction, consistent with supply chain or installation-time malware. The obfuscation, combined with file system scanning, hashing, and exfiltration of data to an external server, matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including data exfiltration, environment reconnaissance, and stealthy payload delivery. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, and the code suppresses errors and uses dynamic code execution patterns. All these factors strongly indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
