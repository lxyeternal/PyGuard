      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It recursively searches for files with sensitive extensions and directories (e.g., .git, .env, .svn) starting from parent directories and system paths, including common web server directories. It archives these files and directories into zip files without user consent or notification. Then, it uploads these archives to a hardcoded external FTP server (IP 185.62.57.60) using hardcoded credentials, which is a classic data exfiltration technique. The code also sends HTTP GET requests to the same external IP with user and path information, indicating host fingerprinting and reconnaissance. The use of suppressed error handling, lack of user interaction, and targeting of sensitive configuration and source code files further confirm malicious intent. The code runs automatically on execution (via main()), performing these actions silently. These behaviors align with known malware patterns of unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, making this code malicious."
