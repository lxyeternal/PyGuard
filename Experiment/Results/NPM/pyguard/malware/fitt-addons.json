      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It immediately spawns a detached reverse shell connection to a hardcoded external IP address (47.154.53.138) on port 1337 using 'nc' (netcat) with '/bin/sh' as the shell, enabling unauthorized remote control of the host. It collects sensitive system and user information including package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package version, then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c9k25ex2vtc000050g50gr3i4ioyyyyyr.interact.sh) without user consent or notification. Additionally, it appends a hardcoded SSH public key to the user's authorized_keys file, effectively adding a persistent backdoor for SSH access. The code suppresses errors on network requests, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of reverse shell creation, stealthy data exfiltration, unauthorized SSH key insertion, and communication with suspicious external endpoints is a classic hallmark of malware designed for remote access, persistence, and reconnaissance. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code."
