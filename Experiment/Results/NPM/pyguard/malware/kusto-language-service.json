      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed domain names based on the collected data, which is a common technique for covert data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently and does not log or notify the user, indicating stealthy behavior. Collecting and exfiltrating sensitive system and user information to an external, hardcoded server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and is a common vector for malicious packages."
