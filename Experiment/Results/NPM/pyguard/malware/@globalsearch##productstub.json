      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and performs several suspicious actions consistent with malicious behavior. It dynamically decodes obfuscated strings and uses the 'os' module to gather sensitive system information such as the hostname, username, and platform. It attempts to execute system commands to augment this information, indicating reconnaissance of the host environment. The code then constructs an HTTPS GET request to a hardcoded external domain (notably 'realbatman.com') with query parameters that include encoded username, admin status, hostname, and the current directory (__dirname). This is a classic data exfiltration pattern. Furthermore, the code disables or bypasses normal error handling and sends this information without any user interaction or notification. The obfuscation, combined with the collection and transmission of sensitive user and system data to an external server, strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscation, environment reconnaissance, and unauthorized data exfiltration."
