      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive environment and process information from the global process object, including npm package metadata and various environment variables. It then applies a complex filter to exclude certain environments (likely analysis or sandbox environments). If the environment passes these checks, it encodes the collected data as a base64 string with a minor modification and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (eoarenda8drrzt2.m.pipedream.net). The code runs immediately and silently without user interaction or notification, and it suppresses errors on the network request, indicating an intent to evade detection. This pattern of environment reconnaissance combined with stealthy exfiltration of potentially sensitive package and environment data to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks or information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, and the obfuscated construction of keys and URLs further supports malicious intent."
