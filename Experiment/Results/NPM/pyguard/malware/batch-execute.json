It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The isValid function attempts to exclude certain hostnames and paths, likely to evade detection or analysis environments. The overall behavior is consistent with host fingerprinting and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The hardcoded external domain, combined with the collection and exfiltration of sensitive system and user information, strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package has no author information and a very high version number (99.10.9), which can be indicators of a potentially malicious or untrustworthy package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
