It then sends this sensitive data via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (enjglpdgtgrbn4b.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The endpoint is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate service. This pattern of gathering detailed host environment data and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded URL is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, no error handling beyond basic logging, and no documentation or indication of benign intent. According to the provided knowledge points, such direct collection and transmission of environment and system data to an unknown external server is a strong indicator of malware or malicious code."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Additionally, the dependencies 'http', 'https', and 'os' are not standard or commonly used packages and appear to be suspicious or potentially malicious, as these names correspond to Node.js core modules and should not be installed from npm. The 'http' package version '0.0.1-security' is known to be a placeholder package used to patch vulnerabilities but can be abused. Overall, the combination of a preinstall script executing code and unusual dependencies suggests potential malicious behavior."
