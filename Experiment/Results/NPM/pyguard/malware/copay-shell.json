      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data into hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known for use in security testing and malicious command-and-control (C2) operations. The code performs multiple DNS lookups to these constructed queries without user consent or notification, indicating covert reconnaissance. Additionally, it sends a JSON string containing all collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive system and user information to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality, no error handling or logging for network operations, and no indication that this data collection and transmission serves a benign purpose. These factors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration used in malware and supply chain attacks."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
