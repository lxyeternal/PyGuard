      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the system using os.hostname() and immediately sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eoenp5lacdw4vru.m.pipedream.net). This behavior matches a known malicious pattern of silent system reconnaissance and data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The code lacks any error handling or legitimate user-facing functionality, and the external endpoint is unrelated to any benign application purpose. The minimalistic structure and direct network communication to an attacker-controlled endpoint strongly indicate malicious intent, consistent with malware that performs host fingerprinting and exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains both 'Dependencies' and 'dependencies' fields, which is unusual and may indicate an attempt to confuse dependency management tools. It includes two similarly named dependencies: 'request' (a well-known HTTP client) and 'requests' (a much less common package), where 'requests' could be a malicious or typo-squatting package. Additionally, the scripts section runs 'node index.js --save-prod' during preinstall, postinstall, and start phases, which is suspicious because running arbitrary code during install scripts can be used to execute malicious payloads. The very high version number '999.99.99' is also unusual and may be an attempt to bypass version checks. Overall, these factors suggest potentially malicious behavior."
