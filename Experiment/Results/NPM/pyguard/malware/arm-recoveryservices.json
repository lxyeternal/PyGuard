      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and enumerates files from root and common drive directories (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data into a hex-encoded string combined with network and path information, then performs DNS lookups on a suspicious, hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain conditions on hostname, username, and paths are met, it proceeds to send this collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently, uses generic function names, and performs network communication to an attacker-controlled domain, which is a classic pattern of reconnaissance and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. The combination of host fingerprinting, file enumeration, and exfiltration to a hardcoded external server without consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or a supply chain attack payload."
