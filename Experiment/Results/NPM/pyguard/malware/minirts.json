      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (e.g., C:\\, D:\\, /home). It then encodes this data into a hex-encoded string combined with network and path information, constructs DNS queries, and performs DNS lookups to a suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). Subsequently, it sends a POST request containing serialized system information to the same external domain over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code includes multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths, indicating an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The data exfiltration is done silently with suppressed error handling and no logging, which is typical of malware behavior. The external domain is hardcoded and unrelated to any legitimate package functionality, and the overall pattern matches known malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration techniques used in supply chain or runtime malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior, and the code runs automatically upon module load or execution. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious and designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
