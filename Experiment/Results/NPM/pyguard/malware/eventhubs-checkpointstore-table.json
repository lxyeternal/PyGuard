It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently, uses multiple heuristics to exclude certain hostnames or paths from sending data, indicating evasion attempts. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data theft malware. The absence of legitimate user-facing functionality, combined with the stealthy network communication to an attacker-controlled server, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or a supply chain attack payload."
