      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in a custom hex-based format combined with network and path information, then constructs DNS queries and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain conditions on hostname, username, and paths are met (mostly excluding known or local environments), it proceeds to send the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently, uses generic function names, and performs network communication to an attacker-controlled domain, which is a classic pattern of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. The data exfiltration is stealthy and automatic, triggered on module load or execution, which is typical of malicious reconnaissance or information-stealing malware. Based on the extensive knowledge points, this behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, specifically unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to an external server."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
