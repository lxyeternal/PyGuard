      "malicious_behavior": "The code assigns a hardcoded external IP URL (http://129.152.20.51/components/index.js) directly to document.location, which causes the browser to navigate to and load a remote JavaScript file from an untrusted source without any user interaction or validation. This pattern is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior because it enables automated retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote server. The use of a raw IP address instead of a domain name, combined with the direct navigation to a remote script, is highly suspicious and consistent with malware techniques for remote payload delivery, code injection, or drive-by downloads. There is no benign justification for such direct redirection to an external IP hosting a JavaScript file, especially without user consent or notification. Therefore, this code is strongly indicative of malicious intent."

This behavior is suspicious because it attempts to send potentially sensitive user and system information to an external server during the package installation process, which is a common tactic used in malicious packages to exfiltrate data or perform reconnaissance on the victim's machine."
