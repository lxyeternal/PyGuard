      "malicious_behavior": "The code is obfuscated using an array of encoded strings and an index-mapping function, which is a common technique to hide intent. It collects extensive system information via the 'os' module, including architecture, endianness, free memory, home directory, hostname, network interfaces (specifically the 'en0' interface), platform, release, temporary directory, total memory, system type, uptime, and a hardcoded package name 'radar-core'. It then serializes this data to JSON, encrypts it using a function from a local './util' module, and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (81.70.191.194) on port 17125 to the path '/healthy'. After sending the data, the process listens for response data and writes it to stdout, but does not handle errors meaningfully (the error handler is empty), and then immediately ends the request. Notably, if the hostname does not contain a dot and the platform is not 'darwin' (macOS), the process exits immediately with code 1, indicating conditional execution based on environment. The combination of obfuscation, collection of detailed system and network interface information, encryption of the data, transmission to a hardcoded external IP without user consent or notification, and immediate process exit strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, no error handling or logging for network operations, and the external endpoint is suspicious and unrelated to any known benign service. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including system fingerprinting, stealthy data exfiltration, obfuscation, and use of hardcoded external endpoints."
