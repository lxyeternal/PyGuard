It then sends this information via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint, which is an external server controlled by the attacker. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. The use of a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, such direct collection and exfiltration of host-specific data to an external, hardcoded endpoint without user interaction or legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means arbitrary JavaScript code in 'index.js' will execute during installation, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Without seeing 'index.js', this is suspicious, especially combined with the unusual version number '99.9.0' and the author email 'savik@wearehackerone.com' which might be an attempt to appear legitimate. The 'preinstall' hook can be used to run malicious code on the user's system during package installation."
