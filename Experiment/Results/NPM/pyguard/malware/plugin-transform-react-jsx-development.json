      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation of hostname, path, and username, which appears designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding of sensitive environment data, and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no benign justification for this behavior in typical NPM packages, and the use of hardcoded suspicious domains, silent network communication, and extensive environment probing strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts without user consent. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-react-jsx-development' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to known legitimate packages, and the description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated. The combination of an unusual preinstall script and unclear metadata suggests potential malicious intent."
