      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata without any user interaction or consent. It encodes this data into hex strings and constructs DNS query names targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known to be used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware and penetration testing. The code performs multiple DNS lookups to these constructed queries, effectively leaking system fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends a POST request over HTTPS to the same suspicious external domain, transmitting a JSON string containing detailed environment and user information. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The domain used is not related to the package's purpose and is hardcoded, indicating intent to exfiltrate data to an attacker-controlled server. The absence of error logging and user notification further indicates stealth. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of reconnaissance and data exfiltration, making this code malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and commonly used in malicious packages to run unwanted code during installation."
