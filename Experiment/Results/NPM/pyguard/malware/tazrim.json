This behavior leaks potentially sensitive environment details to a third party without user consent, which is considered malicious. Additionally, the 'preinstall' script runs automatically during installation, making this data exfiltration stealthy. The dependency on itself ('tazrim') is suspicious and may be used to trigger recursive or confusing behavior."
