      "malicious_behavior": "This code performs an unsolicited HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://lolzettle-bololstaff-account.package.0xlupin.com) immediately upon execution, without user interaction or consent. The domain name is non-standard and appears to be attacker-controlled, which is a common indicator of malicious intent. The code is designed to run automatically (e.g., as part of a package install or import), and its only purpose is to 'check authorization' by contacting this external server. This pattern matches known reconnaissance and beaconing behaviors used in supply chain attacks, where the installation of a package triggers a call home to the attacker's infrastructure, potentially for tracking, fingerprinting, or further payload delivery. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation justifying this network communication. The use of a package name as a subdomain further suggests automated tracking or targeting. This behavior is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks in the JavaScript/NPM ecosystem.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json specifies a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node app.js' automatically during the installation process. This means arbitrary JavaScript code in app.js will be executed on the user's system as soon as the package is installed, without user interaction or consent. This is a classic supply chain attack vector and a high-risk indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows for remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. The use of a preinstall hook to execute code is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, especially when the executed file (app.js) is not a standard build or setup script and its contents are unknown. This pattern is rarely, if ever, justified in benign packages and is a critical red flag.",
