It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The domain used is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package purpose. The overall behavior matches known malware patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, with no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation. This is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and information theft, consistent with supply chain or post-installation malware. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
