      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, DNS servers, current directory, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names that are sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious domain without any user consent or notification. The code performs these network communications silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealthy data exfiltration. The combination of gathering sensitive host-specific information and transmitting it to an attacker-controlled domain is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. There is no legitimate or documented purpose for this data collection and transmission in typical package code, and the use of interactsh.com strongly suggests command-and-control or exfiltration activity. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package name 'solc-0.4.13' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to official Solidity compiler versions, suggesting it may be a spoofed or malicious package. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise suspicion."
