It then serializes this information into a string and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL used for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code runs immediately upon import (via an immediately invoked async function), performing this data collection and exfiltration silently, without any legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling that would indicate benign use. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving host fingerprinting and unauthorized data leakage."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'bngularjs' is similar to 'angularjs', and the repository URL points to a user named 'serialfuzzer' with a project named 'AngulerJS', which suggests possible typosquatting or dependency confusion attack. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further indicates this package might be designed to exploit dependency confusion vulnerabilities."
