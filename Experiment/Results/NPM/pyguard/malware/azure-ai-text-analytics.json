It encodes this data in hexadecimal and constructs DNS queries to a suspicious hardcoded domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in offensive security and malware contexts. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. The data exfiltration is done silently without error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The combination of host fingerprinting, user environment data collection, DNS queries to attacker-controlled domains, and HTTP POST exfiltration to a hardcoded suspicious domain is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware behavior. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code for this behavior, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to an external attacker-controlled server."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name and description appear to mimic a legitimate Azure package, which could be an attempt to deceive users. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious activity."
