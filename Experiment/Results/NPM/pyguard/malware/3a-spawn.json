      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a network POST request to a hardcoded external domain ('cryptopriceoffer.com') with a token read from a hidden directory in the user's home folder ('.svnlook/svntoken'). It writes the response data directly to a JavaScript file ('checksvn.js') in that hidden directory and immediately executes it using a shell command ('node <path>'). This sequence of fetching remote code, writing it to disk, and executing it without user interaction or validation is a classic hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code disables TLS certificate verification (NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0), which allows it to bypass SSL security checks and communicate with potentially malicious servers undetected. The use of a hidden directory in the user's home folder for storing tokens and payloads, combined with silent execution of downloaded code, strongly indicates malicious intent such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or persistence. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality, no error handling beyond logging, and no documentation or authentication, all of which further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."
