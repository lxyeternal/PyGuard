      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node app.js' before installation. This means that any code inside app.js will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, downloading malware, or compromising the system. Additionally, the 'main' field is incorrectly set to 'node app.js' instead of a file path, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious. The presence of a preinstall script running arbitrary code is suspicious and potentially harmful."
