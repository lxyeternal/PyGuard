      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json specifies a 'preinstall' script: './pre.sh'. This means that, upon installation of the package (npm install), the shell script 'pre.sh' will be executed automatically. This is a high-risk pattern and a common vector for supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the user's system during installation, without user interaction or consent. The contents of 'pre.sh' are not provided, so it is impossible to determine its intent from this file alone. However, the mere presence of a preinstall script that executes a shell file is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior, especially since this is not a standard or necessary step for most npm packages. This pattern is frequently observed in malware and supply chain attacks, as it enables attackers to execute arbitrary commands, download further payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system. The package also has a suspicious name ('ganache-core-coverage'), which could be a typosquat of legitimate packages, further increasing the risk.",
