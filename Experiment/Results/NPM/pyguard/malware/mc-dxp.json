It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ufdsxykm7jz6b3x9s1slq5bda4gv4nsc.oastify.com) without any user consent or notification. The domain used is not related to the package or any known legitimate service and is likely attacker-controlled. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment information and exfiltrating it to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior, consistent with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
