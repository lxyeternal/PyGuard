      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and recursively enumerates files from root directories (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from system data, which is a form of covert network communication. The conditional checks on hostname, username, and paths appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments, indicating stealth behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. This pattern of gathering sensitive environment and file system data and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without consent is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
