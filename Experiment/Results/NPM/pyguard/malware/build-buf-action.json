It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ydfpycccdlf63zh24xrxe7st6kcb0aoz.oastify.com) without any user consent or notification. The domain used is non-standard and appears to be a tracking or exfiltration endpoint. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection or transmission. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."

This behavior is highly suspicious as it attempts to fetch data or execute code from an external, potentially malicious server during the package installation process. Additionally, the description 'hijacked by faique' and unusual dependency names suggest the package may have been compromised or tampered with."
