      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'postinstall' script: \"postinstall\": \"node ./post-install.cjs\". This means that arbitrary JavaScript code in 'post-install.cjs' will be executed automatically upon installation of the package, which is a well-known vector for supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malicious behavior in the JavaScript/NPM ecosystem. While the dependencies themselves do not appear suspicious, the presence of a postinstall hook that runs a local script is a critical risk indicator. Without inspecting the contents of 'post-install.cjs', it is impossible to guarantee the absence of malicious behavior, but the use of this pattern is highly suspicious and often used to execute code for data exfiltration, remote code execution, or further payload delivery during install time, without user consent or notification.",
