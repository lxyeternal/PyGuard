      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation of hostname, path, and username, which appears designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the data collection. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for transmitting detailed host fingerprinting and file system data is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no indication of benign purpose, and the behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as automated host profiling, stealthy network communication, and exfiltration of sensitive system information to an external server. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
