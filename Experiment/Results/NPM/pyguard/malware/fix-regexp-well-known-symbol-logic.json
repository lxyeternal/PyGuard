      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data. It then sends this information silently to an external, hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes potentially sensitive information such as file listings from system root and user directories, hostnames, usernames, and network configuration. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. This pattern of host fingerprinting and silent exfiltration to a suspicious external server is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data theft behavior consistent with malware. Therefore, the code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'fix-regexp-well-known-symbol-logic' and version '99.10.9' mimic legitimate package naming conventions, which may be an attempt to disguise malicious intent. The 'index.js' file is not provided, so the exact behavior is unknown, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a red flag for potential malicious behavior."
