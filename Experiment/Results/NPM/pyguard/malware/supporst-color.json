Immediately after the download finishes, it executes this downloaded file using the child_process.exec function. This pattern of fetching a remote file and executing it without any user interaction, validation, or consent is a classic hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The use of a .lnk file (Windows shortcut) as the payload is suspicious because it can be used to execute arbitrary commands or payloads. There is no error handling or logging, indicating an attempt to operate stealthily. The code also mixes benign utility functions with this malicious payload delivery and execution logic, which is a common obfuscation tactic. Overall, this code automates retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote source, which is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a suspicious 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. Running arbitrary code during preinstall is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the package name 'supporst-color' is suspiciously similar to the popular 'supports-color' package, indicating a possible typo-squatting attempt to trick users into installing this package instead of the legitimate one. Without the actual 'index.js' code, the preinstall script's behavior cannot be fully verified, but this combination strongly suggests malicious intent."
