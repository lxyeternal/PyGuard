      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link) and saves it locally as 'README.txt.lnk' in the current directory. Immediately after the download finishes, it executes this downloaded file using the child_process.exec function. This pattern—automatic retrieval of a remote file followed by its immediate execution without user interaction or validation—is a classic hallmark of malware. It enables remote code execution of potentially untrusted payloads, which can lead to system compromise, persistence, or further malicious actions. The code lacks any error handling, user notification, or legitimate business logic explaining this behavior. The use of a .lnk file (Windows shortcut) as the executable is suspicious and may be used to disguise the payload. Overall, this direct coupling of network retrieval and shell execution from an untrusted source is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
