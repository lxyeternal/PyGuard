      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or test environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the data collection. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for transmitting detailed host fingerprinting and file system data is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no benign justification for this behavior in typical npm packages, and the pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including host fingerprinting, stealthy data collection, and exfiltration to a suspicious external server. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code without user consent. Additionally, the package name 'applicationinsights-dependencies' and description 'azure package' appear to mimic legitimate Azure packages, potentially to deceive users. The lack of author information and minimal metadata further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
