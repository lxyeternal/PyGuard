It serializes this data into JSON, then URL-encodes it and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (fcvrtwwbelbl0a8hnhumzu05twznnhb6.oastify.com). There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and exfiltration. The domain used is not related to the package or any known legitimate service and resembles domains used for testing or malicious data exfiltration (similar to burpcollaborator.net). The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern—collecting host-specific and user information and silently exfiltrating it to an external, attacker-controlled server—is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with reconnaissance and data theft malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
