      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information such as the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package version. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (a subdomain of burpcollaborator.net), which is commonly used for testing or malicious exfiltration. The code does this without any user interaction, notification, or consent, and suppresses errors silently. The presence of direct data exfiltration of environment and user-specific information to an external, suspicious endpoint without legitimate purpose or transparency is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized code, downloading additional payloads, or modifying the system. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially since the package claims to be an SDK but has no author and an unusual description ('SAP Bug Bounty Researcher'). The presence of a preinstall script running arbitrary code is a red flag."
