The code includes dynamic decoding and execution patterns, such as base64 decoding combined with dynamic function invocation, which are typical in malware to evade static analysis. The obfuscation prevents straightforward understanding, but the structure and patterns strongly match known malicious behaviors, including dynamic code execution, potential payload decryption, and execution during module import or installation. There is no indication of legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, and the code appears designed to execute hidden payloads or perform unauthorized actions without user consent. These characteristics align with critical risk indicators for malware, such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, and lack of transparency, confirming that this code contains malicious behavior."
