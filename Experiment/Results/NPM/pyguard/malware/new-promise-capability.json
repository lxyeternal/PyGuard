      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication only if certain hostname, username, and path conditions are not met, indicating evasion or targeting specific environments. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for exfiltration, combined with the stealthy and conditional execution, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with malware behavior such as host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has no author information and an unusually high version number, which can be indicators of a potentially malicious or untrustworthy package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local script is a common vector for malicious activity."
