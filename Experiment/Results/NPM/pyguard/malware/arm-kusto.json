      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names derived from system info, which is a known technique for covert data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The data collection includes potentially sensitive user and system environment details, and the transmission is unconditional unless certain hostname/path conditions are met, which appear to be evasion or targeting checks. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. The code suppresses errors silently and avoids logging, indicating an intent to evade detection. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding, and exfiltration to a suspicious external server without user interaction or consent is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious payloads or compromise the system. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
