It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication immediately upon module execution, indicating automated data exfiltration. The use of hostname and path checks to selectively avoid sending data on certain environments suggests evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The pattern of gathering sensitive environment and system data and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data theft behavior consistent with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
