It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (exf3nf6fnfm5vjdvkeoebt9vum0do3cs.oastify.com) without any user consent, notification, or legitimate purpose. The domain used is not related to the package or any known trusted service and appears to be an attacker-controlled endpoint. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no benign or legitimate functionality evident in the code, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hardcoded suspicious domain, exfiltration of sensitive environment data, lack of user interaction, and stealthy error suppression."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before the package installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads without user consent. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', it is impossible to rule out malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious activity."
