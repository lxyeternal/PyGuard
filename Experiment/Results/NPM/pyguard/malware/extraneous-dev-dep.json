      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known for use in security testing and malicious command-and-control (C2) operations. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, effectively exfiltrating host fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends a POST request over HTTPS to the same suspicious external domain, transmitting a JSON string containing detailed system and user information without any user consent or notification. The data collected and exfiltrated includes sensitive environment and user context, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior, and error handling is minimal and silent, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate domain for data exfiltration, combined with the collection of sensitive system information and network communication without user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or a supply chain attack payload."
