      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json file contains a highly suspicious script definition: 'start': 'npm install .'. This means that running 'npm start' will recursively invoke 'npm install' on the current directory. This is a known anti-pattern and is often used in malicious packages to trigger repeated or hidden installation hooks, which can execute arbitrary code defined in install scripts (e.g., preinstall, postinstall, or in package dependencies). This recursive install loop can be abused to evade static analysis, repeatedly trigger malicious payloads, or install additional dependencies without user consent. While the provided package.json does not directly show a payload, this pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malware in the npm ecosystem. The package name 'epsilonprotect' is also not a well-known or trusted library, which further increases suspicion. There are no other obviously malicious dependencies or scripts, but the recursive install pattern alone is a critical red flag.",
