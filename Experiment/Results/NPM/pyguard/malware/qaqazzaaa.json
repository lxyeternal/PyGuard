This behavior matches a known malicious pattern of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. The hardcoded external URL is not associated with any legitimate service, and the code lacks any error handling or user consent mechanisms beyond basic console logging. The direct collection and exfiltration of host-specific information without user knowledge or authorization is a hallmark of reconnaissance and potential further exploitation by malware. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
