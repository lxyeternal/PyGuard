      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user and system information without any user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The code runs automatically upon import (immediately invoked async function), with no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling beyond logging network errors, indicating stealthy operation. Collecting and exfiltrating host-specific information to an attacker-controlled external server without user knowledge or legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malware and data-stealing behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'dodemailar' and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggest it might be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository URL points to a suspicious or unrelated project ('AngulerJS' instead of 'AngularJS'), which may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package. Without the content of 'new.js', the exact behavior cannot be confirmed, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious activity."
