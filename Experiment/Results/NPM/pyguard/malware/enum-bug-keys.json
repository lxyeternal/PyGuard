      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data to exfiltrate this information to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently, uses multiple heuristic checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths (likely to evade detection or analysis environments), and performs DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from local system data. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The use of network communication to a suspicious hardcoded domain combined with the collection of sensitive environment and system data, and the absence of user interaction or error logging, strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
