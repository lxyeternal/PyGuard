      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses require('child_process').execSync to execute a shell command that is constructed by decoding a large array of ASCII codes into a string. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the actual shell command being run. The decoded command appears to be a base64-encoded string piped through base64 decoding and then executed with the current filename appended. This pattern of obfuscation combined with immediate shell execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code executes arbitrary shell commands without user interaction or notification, and the obfuscation prevents easy inspection of the payload. Such behavior is consistent with malware that downloads, decodes, and executes hidden payloads, often used in supply chain attacks or remote code execution. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this code, and it runs automatically upon import or execution. Based on the extensive knowledge points, this pattern is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
