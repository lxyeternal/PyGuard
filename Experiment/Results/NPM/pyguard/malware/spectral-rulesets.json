      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes potentially sensitive file paths and environment details. The conditional checks on hostname and paths appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments, indicating evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The behavior matches known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, which is a hallmark of malware or spyware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package has an unusually high version number (99.10.9) and minimal metadata, which can be indicators of a potentially malicious or spoofed package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a red flag."
