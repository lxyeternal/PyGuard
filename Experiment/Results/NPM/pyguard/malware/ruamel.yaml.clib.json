It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cm4m8ma2vtc00003s3yggknkrkryyyyyb.oast.fun), which is not related to any legitimate service and resembles domains used for testing or malicious exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses errors silently, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The code performs direct data exfiltration of sensitive environment and user information to an attacker-controlled server without any legitimate purpose or documentation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints, and lack of transparency or user consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."

This is suspicious because it executes a shell script before installation, which can run arbitrary code on the user's system. Without the content of 'pre.sh', it is impossible to verify its safety. Such preinstall scripts are a common vector for malicious behavior in npm packages."
