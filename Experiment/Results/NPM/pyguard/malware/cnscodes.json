      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script file (exps.sh) from a hardcoded external URL (a GitHub raw content URL) and writes it directly to the local filesystem without any user interaction, validation, or notification. This pattern of automated remote payload retrieval and local file writing is a classic hallmark of malware propagation and payload delivery. Although the code snippet itself does not execute the downloaded file, the presence of a shell script download from an untrusted external source strongly indicates preparation for executing potentially malicious code. The lack of error handling or logging further suggests an intent to operate stealthily. Given the critical risk patterns associated with automated remote payload retrieval and local persistence, this code should be considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js' before installation, which can execute arbitrary code. Additionally, it changes permissions of 'exps.sh' to 777 (full read/write/execute for all users), which is suspicious and potentially dangerous. The script then lists directory contents with 'ls'. Running arbitrary scripts during preinstall can be used to execute malicious payloads or escalate privileges."
