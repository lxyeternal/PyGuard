It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or test environments. The code suppresses errors silently, uses obfuscated hex encoding for data, and sends sensitive environment and file system information to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. This pattern of host fingerprinting combined with stealthy data exfiltration to a suspicious external domain is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and information-stealing malware."
