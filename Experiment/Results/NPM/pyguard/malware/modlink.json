It encodes this data into hex strings and constructs DNS queries to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and user data, encoding it, performing DNS lookups to an attacker-controlled domain, and sending the data over HTTPS to that domain is a classic pattern of reconnaissance and data exfiltration used by malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code for this behavior, and the hardcoded suspicious domain strongly indicates malicious intent."
