It also enumerates network interfaces and their IP addresses. This collected data is concatenated, hex-encoded, and then exfiltrated by performing DNS lookups to dynamically constructed subdomains under the suspicious external domain '.ex.neversummer.xyz'. The use of DNS queries for data exfiltration is a known covert channel technique. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose evident in the code. The domain used is not a standard or known benign domain, indicating potential attacker-controlled infrastructure. The code lacks error handling or logging for the network operations, suggesting an intent to operate stealthily. This pattern of gathering sensitive host and user environment data and exfiltrating it to an external, suspicious domain without consent is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package name '@pornhub/alerts' is suspicious and potentially designed to trick users by associating with a well-known adult website, which is a common tactic in malicious packages. The 'preinstall' script runs 'node build-project.js' before installation, but the actual content of 'build-project.js' is not provided. This script could execute arbitrary code during installation, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Without the source of 'build-project.js', it is impossible to verify the safety of this step. Additionally, the package claims to collect system information, which could be used for malicious purposes such as fingerprinting or data exfiltration. Overall, the combination of a suspicious package name, an unexplained preinstall script, and the nature of the package's functionality raises strong concerns about malicious intent."
