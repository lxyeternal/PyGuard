It encodes this data and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication only if certain hostname, username, and path conditions are met, indicating evasion or targeting specific environments. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for sending encoded system data strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with data exfiltration and host fingerprinting. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
