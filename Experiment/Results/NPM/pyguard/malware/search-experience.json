It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (eos075yf4hbqpp9.m.pipedream.net), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently and outputs response data to stdout without any legitimate business logic or user-facing features. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
