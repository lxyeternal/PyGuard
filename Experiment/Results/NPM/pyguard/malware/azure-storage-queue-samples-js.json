      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code performs multiple DNS lookups on constructed query names derived from system info, which is a known exfiltration technique. It suppresses errors silently and uses opaque validation logic to selectively avoid execution on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The behavior matches classic malware reconnaissance and data exfiltration patterns, including host fingerprinting and stealthy communication with attacker-controlled infrastructure. Given the unsolicited collection and exfiltration of sensitive system and user information to an external, hardcoded server, this code exhibits malicious behavior."
