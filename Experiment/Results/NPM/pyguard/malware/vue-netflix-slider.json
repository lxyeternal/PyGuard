It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (0efhp5ufzt8dt38eg76rw26ch3ntbi.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to stealthily exfiltrate data. The combination of gathering host-specific information and transmitting it externally without user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard domain for data exfiltration strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
