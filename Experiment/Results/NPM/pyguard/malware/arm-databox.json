      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns, as it profiles the host environment and sends sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, and the network communication is to a suspicious hardcoded domain. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."
