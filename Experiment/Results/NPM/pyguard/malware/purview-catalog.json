It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or notification. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data theft malware. The code suppresses errors silently, uses generic function names, and performs network communication to an attacker-controlled server. The conditional checks on hostname and paths appear to evade execution on certain environments, indicating evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, specifically automated host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an external, suspicious domain without consent."
