It serializes this data into JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (en47d1uz958z2v9.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party service often used for capturing and analyzing incoming requests, commonly abused for data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and the code suppresses error logging for the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The data exfiltration of host-specific and user-specific information without legitimate purpose or transparency is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. The presence of a hardcoded suspicious external URL combined with immediate network transmission of sensitive environment data classifies this code as malicious."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', it is impossible to rule out malicious behavior. The use of a preinstall script to run custom code is a common vector for malware in npm packages."
