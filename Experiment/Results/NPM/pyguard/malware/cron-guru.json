This behavior is a classic indicator of data exfiltration, as environment variables often contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and configuration secrets. The code uses obfuscation techniques (e.g., encoded function and variable names) to hide its intent, lacks any user interaction or notification, and does not include error handling or logging, indicating an attempt to operate stealthily. The direct transmission of environment variables to an external, hardcoded IP without user consent or legitimate purpose is a strong hallmark of malicious activity, consistent with credential theft or reconnaissance malware. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk malicious behavior."
