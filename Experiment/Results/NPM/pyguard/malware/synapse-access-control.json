      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from system data, which is a common reconnaissance and exfiltration technique. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection on specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. The behavior matches known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, which is a hallmark of malware or supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package has no author information and a vague description, which are common red flags. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a known vector for malicious activity."
