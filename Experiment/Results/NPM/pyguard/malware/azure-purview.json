      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the data collection. The use of DNS lookups with encoded host/path/user info and an HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain is a classic reconnaissance and data exfiltration pattern. This behavior aligns strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration used by malware or supply chain attacks. There is no benign justification for collecting and transmitting such detailed system and file information to an unknown external server, especially with obfuscated encoding and conditional evasion logic. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
