It then sends this detailed system fingerprinting data via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (fb40d252f3831c4553eb428e5620a2a0.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including automated data exfiltration of sensitive system and environment information to an attacker-controlled server. The endpoint is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate service, indicating the intent to stealthily gather and transmit potentially sensitive host information. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."
