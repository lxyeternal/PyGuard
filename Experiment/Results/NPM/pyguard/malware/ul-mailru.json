      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine using os.hostname() and constructs an email sender address from it, then sends an email with a hardcoded SMTP server, credentials, and recipient address. This behavior matches the pattern of collecting host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded domain (kedrns.com) without user consent or notification. The email is sent silently without any user interaction or legitimate authentication flow. The use of a hardcoded SMTP server and credentials to send data externally is a strong indicator of data exfiltration. The code lacks error handling that would prevent silent failures and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. This pattern is consistent with malicious reconnaissance and exfiltration behavior, as it automates the collection and transmission of system information to an attacker-controlled server."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects a large set of environment variables and checks them against a filter of known environment patterns, likely to evade execution in analysis or benign environments. If none of these conditions are met, it serializes the entire environment variables object, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (constructed as 'eod8iy0mxruchl8.m.pipedream.net'). This domain is not related to any legitimate service and is commonly used for capturing HTTP requests in testing or malicious exfiltration. The code performs this data exfiltration silently without user consent or notification, and suppresses any network errors to avoid detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the sole purpose appears to be stealthy environment reconnaissance and exfiltration of potentially sensitive system and user information. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware, consistent with supply chain or post-installation attacks. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
