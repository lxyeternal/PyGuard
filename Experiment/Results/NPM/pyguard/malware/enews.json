It contains a large hex-encoded Base64 string that is decoded twice to reveal a hidden script. This decoded script is then written to a file named 'main.js' in the current directory and immediately executed using a child process. This pattern of multi-layered decoding followed by writing and executing code is a classic obfuscation and payload delivery technique commonly used by malware to evade detection and analysis. The absence of any legitimate user-facing functionality, combined with dynamic code execution of an opaque payload, strongly suggests that the code is designed to execute hidden or unauthorized actions. Such behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks, remote code execution, or other malicious payload deployment. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."
