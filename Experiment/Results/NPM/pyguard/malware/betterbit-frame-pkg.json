      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It dynamically constructs and sends HTTP POST requests containing sensitive system information such as the hostname, current working directory, and the output of shell commands (e.g., 'whoami'). The code reads environment variables and executes shell commands via execSync, then encodes and transmits this data to a hardcoded external URL. It also performs DNS resolution on the target URL, writes data to files with dynamically generated names, and uses asynchronous network requests without any user interaction or notification. The obfuscation, combined with the collection and exfiltration of system and user environment data to an external server, the execution of shell commands, and the lack of legitimate user-facing functionality, strongly indicate that this code is designed for unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
