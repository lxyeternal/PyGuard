It then immediately sends this data to a hardcoded external MongoDB Atlas database URI without any user consent or notification. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment and user information. The presence of a hardcoded connection string with credentials embedded in the source code further indicates malicious intent, as it allows the attacker to receive and store victim system data remotely. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. This pattern matches known malware behavior of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure, which is a strong indicator of malicious activity."
