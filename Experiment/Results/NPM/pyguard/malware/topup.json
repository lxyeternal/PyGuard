      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known for use in security testing and often abused by malware for command-and-control or exfiltration. The code performs multiple DNS lookups to these constructed queries without user consent or notification. Additionally, it sends a JSON string containing detailed system and user information via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive system and user environment information to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality, no error handling or logging for network operations, and no indication that this data collection and transmission is for benign purposes. The pattern of gathering host-specific information and transmitting it externally without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and exfiltration. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
