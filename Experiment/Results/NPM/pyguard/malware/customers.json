This domain is unrelated to any legitimate or known service and appears to be attacker-controlled. The code performs this network communication silently during execution without any user interaction or notification. The purpose of this request is to check if the computer is 'authorized' by the external server, which is a common reconnaissance or beaconing behavior seen in malware. Although the code does not immediately execute further payloads, the presence of network communication to a suspicious external endpoint during package execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially given the lack of legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. This pattern aligns with known malware behaviors involving network communication to attacker-controlled domains for command-and-control, telemetry, or activation checks. Therefore, this code is considered malicious."
