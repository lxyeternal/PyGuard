      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, package version, and the entire package.json content. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (45-79-227-226.ip.linodeusercontent.com) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The endpoint is suspicious and unrelated to the package's stated purpose. The code suppresses error logging for the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering host-specific and user-sensitive data and exfiltrating it to an external server without user knowledge or legitimate purpose is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no benign justification for this behavior in typical package code, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hardcoded external endpoint, collection of user and environment data, silent network exfiltration, and lack of error handling or user notification."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before any installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the dependency 'tttestsupport-common' with version '^70.70.70' appears unusual and potentially fabricated, which could be a vector for malicious code. The combination of an unusual dependency and a preinstall script that executes code suggests potential malicious behavior."
