      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code performs DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from system info and then sends a POST request containing serialized system and file data to the external server. The data collected includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents from system root and user home directories, which is indicative of reconnaissance and data exfiltration. The code suppresses errors silently, has no legitimate user-facing functionality, and uses hardcoded suspicious domain names. The conditional checks on hostname and paths appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments, a common evasion technique. There is no indication of user consent or legitimate purpose for this data collection and transmission. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure, making this code malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the package name and version appear unusual and the description is vague ('azure package'), which can be a tactic to disguise malicious packages."
