      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known to be used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware contexts. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, likely to leak information via DNS requests. Furthermore, it sends a POST request over HTTPS to the same suspicious external domain, transmitting detailed system and user data without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The domain used is not related to the package's stated purpose and is hardcoded, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive data, DNS-based exfiltration, and HTTP POST to an attacker-controlled domain is a classic pattern of malware performing reconnaissance and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code for collecting and sending such detailed system information to an unknown external server. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
