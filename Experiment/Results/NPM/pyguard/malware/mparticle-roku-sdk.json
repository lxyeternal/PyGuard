It serializes this data into JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (vedopvhm0bhwafm12rx7cuq2ltryfp3e.oastify.com) without any user consent or notification. The domain appears to be a non-standard, likely attacker-controlled endpoint used for data exfiltration. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the unusually high version number and the description/author fields referencing 'psycho_012 hackerone' may indicate this is not a legitimate package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
