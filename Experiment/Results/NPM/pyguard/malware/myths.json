It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The conditional checks on hostname and paths appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments, indicating evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The overall pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without notification or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with malware reconnaissance and data exfiltration."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts or perform unwanted actions on the user's system. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
