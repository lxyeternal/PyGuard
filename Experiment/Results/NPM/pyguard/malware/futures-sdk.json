It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain 'burpcollaborator.net', which is a known domain used for testing exfiltration and command-and-control activities. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host-specific information and exfiltrating it silently to an external, suspicious endpoint without user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and commonly used in malicious packages to run unwanted code during installation."
