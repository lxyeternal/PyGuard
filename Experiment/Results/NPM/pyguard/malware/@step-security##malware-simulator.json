      "malicious_behavior": "This package.json contains a preinstall script (\"preinstall\": \"node compile.js\") that executes arbitrary JavaScript code (compile.js) automatically during the installation process, before the user can review or consent to its actions. According to the description, this script makes an outbound call to www.stepsecurity.io as part of the pre-install step. Executing code during installation that contacts an external server is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious or at least highly suspicious behavior. This pattern matches several high-risk and critical-risk indicators: (1) execution of code during installation without user interaction or consent, (2) outbound network communication to a hardcoded external domain, and (3) potential for data exfiltration or further payload delivery. Even if the intent is to simulate malware for testing, this behavior is indistinguishable from real malware at the package manager level and could be abused for tracking, exfiltration, or further compromise. The use of a preinstall script that contacts an external server is a strong indicator of malicious or at least highly suspicious behavior.",
