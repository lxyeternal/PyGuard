      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and file listings from root and common drive directories. It encodes this data into a custom hex-based format combined with network and path information, then constructs DNS queries and performs DNS lookups to a suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain environment conditions are met (via the isValid function), it sends this collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment details and file system enumeration, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data theft. The code suppresses errors silently, uses hardcoded suspicious domains, and performs network communication immediately upon module execution, indicating stealthy behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. These factors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, consistent with malware behavior."
