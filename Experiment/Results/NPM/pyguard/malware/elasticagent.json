      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, DNS servers, current directory, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names that are sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known for use in security testing and often abused for exfiltration or command-and-control. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The code performs these network communications silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealthy data exfiltration. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding data into DNS queries, and exfiltrating via HTTP POST to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code for collecting and transmitting such detailed system information to an unknown external server. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
