      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and file listings from root directories (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from local system data, which is a common reconnaissance and evasion technique. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation function that appears designed to exclude certain known or test environments, indicating an attempt to avoid detection in analysis or developer machines. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and file system data, encoding it, and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without consent or transparency is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
