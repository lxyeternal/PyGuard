It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (7rz86zl1nny0fc2jtnd9lcp3iuolca.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to stealthily exfiltrate data. The combination of gathering host-specific information and transmitting it externally without legitimate purpose or transparency is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, as it compromises user privacy and security by sending potentially sensitive environment and user data to an attacker-controlled server."
