      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with a reverse shell backdoor. It dynamically requires core Node.js modules ('net', 'child_process', 'util') to create a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (50.242.118.99) on port 1111. Upon connection, it spawns a system shell ('cmd' on Windows or '/bin/sh' on Unix-like systems) and pipes the shell's stdin, stdout, and stderr streams through the network socket, effectively enabling remote command execution. The code includes a retry mechanism on connection errors, attempting reconnection up to 10 times before exiting the process, which is typical for persistence and stealth. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic, and the code runs immediately upon loading. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell, enabling unauthorized remote control of the infected system. The use of a hardcoded IP, direct shell spawning, and network socket communication without any safeguards or transparency confirms the code is malicious."
