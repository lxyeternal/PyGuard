      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication conditionally based on hostname and path checks, indicating evasion attempts. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The use of DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from system info further suggests covert data exfiltration. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. The hardcoded suspicious domain, silent error handling, and direct transmission of sensitive data to an external server without consent or authentication strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with credential or asset theft and system fingerprinting. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
