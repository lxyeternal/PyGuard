      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata. It encodes this data into hex strings and constructs DNS query names targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known to be used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. The code performs multiple DNS lookups to these constructed queries, effectively leaking host-specific information. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data collection and transmission. The domain used is not related to the package or any known benign service, indicating command-and-control or data exfiltration intent. The absence of error logging and the stealthy nature of the network calls further support malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behavior of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
