It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and file system information, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The conditional checks on hostname and paths appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments, indicating evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled domain without user interaction or consent strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with malware behavior."
