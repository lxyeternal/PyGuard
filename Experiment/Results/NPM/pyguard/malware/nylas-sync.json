      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including current directory, home directory, hostname, username, local and public IP addresses, and DNS servers. It then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL used for transmitting system fingerprinting data is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The code performs network communication immediately after gathering sensitive environment and user data, which aligns with known malware patterns for reconnaissance and exfiltration. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Since the 'index.js' file is not provided, its contents are unknown, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node file is a common vector for malicious behavior in npm packages."
