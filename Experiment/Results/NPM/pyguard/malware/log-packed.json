It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The isValid function attempts to exclude certain hostnames and paths, likely to evade detection or analysis environments. The overall behavior is consistent with host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. This pattern matches known malicious reconnaissance and exfiltration techniques commonly used in malware and supply chain attacks. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has no author information and a very high version number, which can be indicators of a potentially malicious or untrustworthy package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
