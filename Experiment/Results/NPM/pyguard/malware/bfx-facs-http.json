      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data into hex and constructs DNS query names that are sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious domain without any user consent or notification. The code performs these network communications silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealthy data exfiltration. The domain used is not related to any legitimate package functionality and is hardcoded, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The behavior matches known malware patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive system and user information to an external attacker-controlled server."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
