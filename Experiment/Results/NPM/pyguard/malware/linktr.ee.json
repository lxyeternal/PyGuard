It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (j2efa1ln6c7s0i317pztkr1la.canarytokens.com), which is a suspicious endpoint commonly used for detecting or simulating data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, downloading malware, or stealing information. Without inspecting 'index.js', the presence of a preinstall script running arbitrary code is suspicious and potentially malicious."
