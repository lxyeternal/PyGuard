It encodes this information and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes potentially sensitive environment and file system information, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data theft. The presence of multiple hostname and path checks to exclude certain environments suggests evasion or targeting logic. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The external domain is suspicious and unrelated to any known benign service. This pattern of host fingerprinting combined with silent exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware or a supply chain attack payload."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts or perform unwanted actions on the user's system. Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
