      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, package version, and the entire package.json content. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (356sv2lpkjygtxa2jimze3fvrmxdl59u.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. The code performs this exfiltration silently without any user interaction, notification, or error logging, indicating an intent to stealthily gather and transmit potentially sensitive environment and user data. This pattern of host fingerprinting combined with data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing feature justifying this data collection and transmission, and the use of a suspicious hardcoded external domain for data exfiltration further confirms the malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script runs a curl command to an external URL (https://bes23.free.beeceptor.com) before installation. This behavior is suspicious because it executes a network request during package installation, which could be used to download or execute malicious code, exfiltrate data, or perform other harmful actions. Such scripts are commonly used in malicious packages to compromise the user's environment."
