It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (vxwd9hkn0h2baw8stqh3z0u01r7iv8jx.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any request errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The behavior matches known malicious patterns of automated data exfiltration and host fingerprinting, which are strong indicators of malware. The domain used resembles those commonly employed for testing exfiltration or command-and-control, further raising suspicion. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive environment and user data to an attacker-controlled server, constituting malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, stealing data, or installing backdoors. Additionally, the version number '99.0.0' is unusually high and the description contains an email address with 'bug bounty', which could be an attempt to appear legitimate or lure users. Without the content of 'index.js', the presence of a preinstall script running arbitrary code is suspicious and potentially malicious."
