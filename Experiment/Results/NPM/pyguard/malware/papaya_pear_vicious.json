      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (128.140.123.124) on port 9000 and immediately spawns a shell process (/bin/sh). It then pipes the shell's stdin, stdout, and stderr to the network socket, effectively establishing a reverse shell. This allows the remote host to execute arbitrary shell commands on the infected machine without user consent or notification. The code runs immediately upon import or execution, without any error handling or legitimate user-facing functionality. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, enabling unauthorized remote control of the host system. There is no benign use case for such behavior in typical NPM packages, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hardcoded external IP connection, spawning a shell, and piping shell I/O over the network. Therefore, this code is malicious."
