      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS queries to a suspicious hardcoded domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in offensive security and malware contexts. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The code accesses sensitive environment and system information and transmits it to an attacker-controlled server, which is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
