      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or developer machines. The code suppresses errors silently, uses obfuscated hex encoding for data, and sends the collected data over HTTPS to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. This pattern of host fingerprinting combined with stealthy data exfiltration to a suspicious external domain is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and information theft. The absence of error logging, the use of hardcoded suspicious domains, and the exfiltration of sensitive environment and file system data without consent align with known malware behaviors, specifically data exfiltration and host profiling for further exploitation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase without any tests or validation. The 'index.js' file is not provided, so its contents are unknown, but running code at preinstall can be used to execute malicious payloads or compromise the environment. Additionally, the package has an unusually high version number (99.10.9) and minimal metadata, which are common signs of a potentially malicious or spoofed package."
