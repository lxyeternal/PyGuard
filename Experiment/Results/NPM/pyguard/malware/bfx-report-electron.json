      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data into hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known for use in security testing and often abused for command-and-control or data exfiltration. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, effectively leaking system fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends a JSON string containing this sensitive information via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is stealthy, with error handling suppressing output and no legitimate user-facing functionality. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and network data, encoding it, performing DNS queries, and sending it via HTTPS POST to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no benign or documented purpose for this behavior in typical packages, and the code lacks transparency, user interaction, or error logging, indicating intent to evade detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
