      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, package version, and package.json content. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (\"cctwapa2vtc0000mwpf0ggpqfmeyyyyyb.oast.fun\"), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any request errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domain used is similar in style to known malicious or testing endpoints used for exfiltration. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The code lacks any legitimate business logic or user-facing features justifying this behavior, and the immediate network transmission of sensitive environment data to an attacker-controlled endpoint strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'pre.sh'. This is suspicious because it executes an external shell script during the installation phase, which can run arbitrary commands on the user's system. Without inspecting the contents of 'pre.sh', this behavior is potentially malicious or at least risky, as it could be used to execute harmful code during package installation."
