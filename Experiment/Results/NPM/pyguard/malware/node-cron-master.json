This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it silently collects potentially sensitive environment data without user consent or notification and exfiltrates it to an external, hardcoded endpoint. There is no error handling, logging, or legitimate user-facing functionality, and the network request is made without any user interaction or authentication. The use of a raw IP address rather than a known or trusted domain further increases suspicion. This pattern is a classic example of data exfiltration malware behavior, consistent with credential or secret theft. Therefore, the code is malicious."
