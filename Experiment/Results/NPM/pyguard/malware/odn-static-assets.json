This behavior matches a classic pattern of reconnaissance and data exfiltration commonly seen in malware. The code lacks any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation justifying this data collection and transmission. The hardcoded external endpoint and the immediate network transmission of sensitive system and user information without user interaction or notification strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known indicators of malware that perform host fingerprinting and exfiltration for potential further exploitation or targeted attacks."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that executes './index.js' before installation. Running a JavaScript file directly as a script during installation is unusual and potentially dangerous, as it can execute arbitrary code on the user's system without explicit consent. This behavior is often used in malicious packages to run harmful code during installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively confirm malicious intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is suspicious and a common vector for malicious behavior."
