      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'postinstall' script that executes a shell script (post_install.sh) automatically upon installation. This is a high-risk pattern associated with supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the user's system without their knowledge or consent. The script first makes post_install.sh executable (chmod +x) and then runs it. The contents of post_install.sh are not provided, so it is impossible to determine its exact behavior, but this pattern is frequently used in malicious packages to download and execute additional payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system. Legitimate packages rarely require postinstall shell scripts unless for native module compilation, and even then, such scripts should be scrutinized. The lack of author and license information further increases suspicion. This package should be treated as potentially malicious until the contents of post_install.sh are thoroughly reviewed.",
