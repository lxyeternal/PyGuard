It encodes this data and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The conditional checks on hostname, username, and paths appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments, indicating evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for exfiltration, combined with gathering sensitive host and user data, strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with malware behavior."
