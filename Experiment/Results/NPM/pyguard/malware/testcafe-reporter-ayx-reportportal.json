      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects sensitive system information: the current username (whoami), hostname, and current working directory (pwd). It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (97em8ahl897zdkovig5207qgo7u2iteh3.oastify.com) without any user consent or notification. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including system fingerprinting, data exfiltration, use of obfuscated data encoding (base64), and communication with an attacker-controlled external server. The absence of legitimate business logic, user interaction, or error handling around the network operation further supports the conclusion that this code is designed for covert data exfiltration and is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This means that before installation, it executes the 'index.js' file and suppresses all output and errors. Running arbitrary code during installation is a common vector for malicious behavior, especially when the executed script is hidden by redirecting output to /dev/null. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious."
