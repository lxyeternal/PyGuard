      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the hostname, current username, and current working directory by executing shell commands ('hostname', 'whoami', 'pwd'). It then encodes these values in base64 and exfiltrates them by performing DNS queries to an external, hardcoded domain ('fadam.eu') using 'nslookup'. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and transmitting it externally without user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration. The use of shell command execution combined with network communication to an external domain, without any legitimate user-facing purpose or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, host fingerprinting, and covert communication with attacker-controlled infrastructure."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation without visible output can be used to execute malicious payloads or perform unwanted actions silently. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the use of a preinstall script that suppresses output is a common tactic in malicious packages."
