This behavior is suspicious because it contacts an external server during package installation, which can be used for tracking, data exfiltration, or triggering other malicious actions. Using a canarytokens.com domain suggests it might be a honeypot or tracking mechanism, but running arbitrary network requests in preinstall scripts is a common vector for malicious activity."
