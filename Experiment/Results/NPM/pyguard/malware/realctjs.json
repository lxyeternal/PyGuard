      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused by malware authors for stealthy data collection. Additionally, the code executes immediately upon import (via an immediately invoked async function), performing this data collection and exfiltration silently and without any legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling beyond logging network errors. There is no benign or documented purpose for this behavior, and it matches multiple critical risk patterns such as gathering host-specific information and sending it externally without consent, use of hardcoded webhook URLs, and automated data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'realctjs' and repository URL 'https://github.com/serialfuzzer/AngulerJS.git' appear unrelated and potentially deceptive. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests this package might be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks, where a malicious package is published with a name similar to an internal package to trick systems into installing it. Overall, the presence of a preinstall script running an external JS file combined with suspicious naming and keywords indicates potentially malicious intent."
