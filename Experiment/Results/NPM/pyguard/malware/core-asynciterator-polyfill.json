      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or notification. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed domain names based on the collected data, which is a form of covert data exfiltration. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The data exfiltration is done silently with suppressed error handling and no logging, indicating stealth. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. These behaviors align with typical malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure, constituting a high risk of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'core-asynciterator-polyfill' and version '99.10.9' are unusual and may be attempting to masquerade as a legitimate package. The description is vague ('azure package'), and the author field is empty, which are common signs of a potentially malicious or typosquatting package."
