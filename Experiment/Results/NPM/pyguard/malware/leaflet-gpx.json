However, appended at the end is a heavily obfuscated script that performs suspicious actions: it inspects the environment, checks cookies, and attaches event listeners to all forms on the page to capture form input data (including fields named like 'password' or 'email'). It encodes this data along with the current URL and document cookies, then exfiltrates it to an external URL constructed dynamically. The obfuscation via string arrays and indirect indexing, the silent data collection without user consent, and the network exfiltration of sensitive form data and cookies are classic hallmarks of malicious behavior consistent with credential theft or information stealing malware. This appended code is unrelated to the stated purpose of the GPX parser and is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
