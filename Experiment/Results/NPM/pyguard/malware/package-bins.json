It encodes this information in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion techniques to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The hardcoded external domain and the nature of the data exfiltrated strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with credential or asset theft, host fingerprinting, and unauthorized data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
