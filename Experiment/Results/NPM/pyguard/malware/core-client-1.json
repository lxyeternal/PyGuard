      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from system data, which is a common reconnaissance technique. The conditional 'isValid' function attempts to exclude certain known hostnames or paths, likely to evade detection or avoid sending data from analysis environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server, stealthy error suppression, and use of hardcoded suspicious domains. Therefore, this code is malicious and is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information without user consent."

Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
