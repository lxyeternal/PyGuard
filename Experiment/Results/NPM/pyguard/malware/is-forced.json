      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation of hostname, path, and user info, but the conditions mostly exclude known benign environments, effectively enabling data exfiltration on most other hosts. The code suppresses errors silently, avoids logging, and performs network communication stealthily. The domain used is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package purpose. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, environment reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to perform malicious actions such as modifying files, stealing data, or installing malware. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a common vector for malicious activity."
