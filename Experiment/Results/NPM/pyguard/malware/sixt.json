It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (bfunwog0vxw47kn6no328mdtqkwjk8.oastify.com) without any user consent or notification. The domain appears to be a non-standard, likely attacker-controlled endpoint used for data exfiltration. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data theft behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
