      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user and system information without any user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The code runs immediately upon import (due to the immediately invoked async function assigned to 'main'), without any user interaction or legitimate purpose. There is no error handling around the webhook URL or any user-facing functionality, indicating stealthy data theft. Collecting and exfiltrating host-specific information to an attacker-controlled external server without consent is a hallmark of malware and a critical risk pattern. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during installation, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'reacqtjs' and repository URL 'https://github.com/serialfuzzer/AngulerJS.git' appear to be typos or attempts to mimic popular packages (React and AngularJS), which is a common tactic in dependency confusion or typosquatting attacks. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further suggests this package is designed to exploit such vulnerabilities."
