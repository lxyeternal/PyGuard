It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from system data, which is a common reconnaissance technique. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation function that appears designed to evade detection on certain hostnames or paths, indicating stealth behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The domain used is suspicious and unrelated to any known benign service. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration used in malware and supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'eslint-plugin-azure-sdk' and version '99.10.9' appear unusual and may be attempting to impersonate a legitimate package. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious activity."
