      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (e.g., C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication conditionally based on hostname and path checks, likely to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The use of DNS lookups with encoded host/path/user info and an HTTP POST to an attacker-controlled domain strongly indicates malicious intent for data exfiltration. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, and the code runs automatically upon import or execution, consistent with supply chain or post-install malware. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, stealthy data exfiltration, and communication with suspicious external servers."
