It gathers data such as the package name, current directory, OS home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package version. This data is serialized into a JSON string and sent via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain 'cmj1w2g2vtc0000pvj60gkjy6boyyyyyb.oast.fun' on port 443. The code uses obfuscation techniques (indirect string references and array shifting) to hide its intent. There is no error handling or user interaction, indicating stealthy behavior. The domain used is not related to any legitimate service and is consistent with domains used for exfiltration or command-and-control. The combination of environment fingerprinting, obfuscated code, and silent data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious activity, consistent with known malware patterns for reconnaissance and data theft."

Additionally, the 'postinstall' script runs 'node index.js' automatically after installation, which can execute arbitrary code without user consent. This combination is suspicious and can be used to execute malicious code during installation."
