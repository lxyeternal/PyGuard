      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, DNS servers, current directory, and package metadata. It encodes this data into hex strings and constructs DNS query names targeting a hardcoded suspicious domain 'c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggnsdwfyyyyyyn.interactsh.com'. It performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, which is a known technique for covert data exfiltration via DNS. Additionally, it sends the collected data as an HTTP POST request to the same suspicious domain without any user consent or notification. The domain 'interactsh.com' is commonly used in security research and malware for out-of-band interaction and command-and-control. The code runs automatically upon import or execution, with no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling, indicating stealth. This pattern of gathering sensitive host and user environment information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded, suspicious domain is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
