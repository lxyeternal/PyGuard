It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (\"lxmzimwfot13fvgsj08m1viq5hb8aw1kq.oastify.com\"), which is not related to any legitimate service. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The data exfiltration of environment and user-specific information to an unknown external server without any legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints, and lack of legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This script executes a JavaScript file named 'index.js' during the installation phase, and redirects all output and errors to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to run arbitrary code silently during installation, which is a common technique used by malicious packages to execute harmful actions without the user's knowledge. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this cannot be definitively classified as malicious, but the use of a hidden preinstall script is a red flag and warrants further investigation."
