This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including automated data exfiltration of sensitive environment data to an attacker-controlled server, use of a hardcoded suspicious domain, absence of error handling or logging (indicating stealth), and no legitimate user-facing purpose or documentation. The immediate network transmission of encoded environment variables to an unknown external endpoint is a classic hallmark of information-stealing malware or supply chain attack payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious."
