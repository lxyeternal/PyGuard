      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that downloads and runs executable files from external URLs without any user interaction or consent. Specifically, it uses 'curl' to silently download a batch script ('strings.bat') and an executable ('test.exe') to the temporary directory, then immediately executes the batch script and attempts to start another batch file ('test.bat'). This sequence of automated remote payload retrieval and execution is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise. The absence of error handling, user notification, or legitimate business logic, combined with the use of hardcoded external URLs (including a Discord CDN link and a bashupload.com link) for payload delivery, strongly indicates malicious intent."
