It serializes this data into JSON, then URL-encodes it and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cm30n6w2vtc0000cv6m0gkbokucyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is a non-standard domain often used for testing or malicious exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose indicated for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering sensitive host and user information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but such scripts are commonly used to run malicious code, steal data, or compromise the system. Additionally, the description mentions a 'dependency confiuse vulnerability,' which is a known attack vector involving malicious packages with similar names to legitimate ones, suggesting potential malicious intent."
