It serializes this data into JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ccwt8fs2vtc0000eb0qgggqpr8hyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is not related to any legitimate service. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses errors silently, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The combination of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without any legitimate purpose or documentation is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, as it enables attackers to fingerprint the host environment and potentially prepare for further exploitation or targeted attacks."
