      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information in a custom hex-based format and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data targeting a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed names and sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the external server without any user interaction or notification. The isValid function attempts to exclude certain hostnames and paths, likely to evade detection or avoid running in analysis environments. The data exfiltration is stealthy, with error handling suppressing exceptions and no logging or user consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, environment reconnaissance, and unauthorized data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled domain. There is no legitimate or documented purpose for this data collection and transmission in the code. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
