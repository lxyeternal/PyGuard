      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data into hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, effectively leaking system fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends a JSON string containing this sensitive information via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and network data, encoding it, performing DNS queries, and sending it via HTTPS POST to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a classic pattern of reconnaissance and data exfiltration used by malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code for such behavior, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, and communication with suspicious external endpoints."
