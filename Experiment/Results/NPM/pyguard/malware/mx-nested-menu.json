      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code contains a large block of legitimate Angular component code for a nested menu, which appears benign. However, appended after this legitimate code is a heavily obfuscated script that exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. This obfuscated code uses an encoded string (_jevR) and multiple functions with non-descriptive names to perform stealthy operations. It checks for certain cookies and conditions, then attaches event listeners to all forms on the page to intercept form submissions. When a form with input fields of type 'password' or with names like 'pwd' or 'password' is submitted, it collects all form element names and values, concatenates them with the current location and document cookies, encodes this data in base64, and sends it to a suspicious external URL constructed dynamically. The code also manipulates cookies to track execution and avoid repeated exfiltration. The obfuscation, form data interception, encoding of sensitive data, and exfiltration to an external domain without user consent are classic hallmarks of credential-stealing malware. This behavior is unrelated to the legitimate Angular menu component and indicates that the package or script has been compromised or maliciously injected with data theft functionality."
