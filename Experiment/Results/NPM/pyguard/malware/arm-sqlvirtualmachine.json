      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It then encodes this data into a custom hex-based format combined with network and path information, constructs DNS query names, and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain environment conditions are met (via the isValid function), it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user interaction or notification. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment details and file system information, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data theft malware. The code suppresses errors silently, uses hardcoded suspicious domains, and performs network communication immediately upon module execution, all without legitimate user-facing functionality or consent. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
