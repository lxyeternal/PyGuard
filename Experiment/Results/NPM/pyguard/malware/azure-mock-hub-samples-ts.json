      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in a custom hex and dotted format and constructs DNS queries and HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication to an attacker-controlled server, which is a classic data exfiltration pattern. The conditional checks on hostname, username, and paths appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments, indicating stealth behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding, and exfiltration to a suspicious external domain strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with reconnaissance and data theft malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
