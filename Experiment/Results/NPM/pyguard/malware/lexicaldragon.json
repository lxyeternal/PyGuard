It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external domain (eohrcqzfk3223us.m.pipedream.net), which is suspicious and likely attacker-controlled. Additionally, it writes a local file named 'locatethisfileforpoc' with the content 'execution achieved', which may be used as a marker or for persistence. The network request is made silently without error handling or logging, indicating an intent to exfiltrate data stealthily. The combination of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded endpoint without user interaction or legitimate purpose is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware patterns."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious elements that indicate potential malicious behavior. It has both 'request' and 'requests' dependencies, where 'requests' is a known typo-squatting package that can be malicious. Additionally, the scripts section runs 'node index.js --save-prod' during preinstall, postinstall, and start phases, which is unusual and can be used to execute arbitrary code during installation and runtime. The combination of suspicious dependencies and aggressive script execution suggests potential malicious intent."
