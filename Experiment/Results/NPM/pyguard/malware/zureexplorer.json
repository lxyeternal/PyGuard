      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and home directories on both Windows and Unix-like systems. It encodes this information in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data containing this sensitive information. It then sends this data silently to an external, hardcoded domain (425a2.33mail.ga) via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and avoids logging, indicating an intent to evade detection. The data exfiltration includes potentially sensitive file paths and user environment details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The presence of multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, making this code malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads or compromise the system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
