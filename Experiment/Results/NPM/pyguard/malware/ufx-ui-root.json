It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names that are sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The domain used is not related to the package's stated purpose and is hardcoded, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code performs host fingerprinting and exfiltrates sensitive environment and user information to an attacker-controlled server, consistent with reconnaissance and data theft behavior typical of malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
