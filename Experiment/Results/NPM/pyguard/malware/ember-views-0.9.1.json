      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as hostname, platform type, user info, and current working directory without user consent. It then serializes and encrypts this data and encodes it in base64. Subsequently, it sends this encoded, encrypted system information to an external, hardcoded URL (https://kotko.me) via an HTTP GET request with query parameters constructed from package-related strings and the encoded data. This behavior is a classic example of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Additionally, the code writes a file named 'pocByKotko.txt' with a suspicious message, which may be used for proof of concept or persistence. The presence of encryption and base64 encoding before exfiltration suggests an attempt to evade detection. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The external domain is unrelated to the code context and appears suspicious. These factors align strongly with known malicious patterns of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. Specifically, the 'preinstall' script runs 'npm i request --save-dev', which installs a package during the installation phase, an unusual and potentially dangerous practice as it modifies dependencies dynamically. Additionally, the 'postinstall' and 'test' scripts both run 'node index.js', which could execute arbitrary code during installation and testing. The presence of both 'Dependencies' (capitalized) and 'dependencies' (empty) fields is irregular and may be an attempt to confuse dependency resolution. Also, the 'crypto' and 'os' packages listed as dependencies are not standard npm packages but core Node.js modules, suggesting possible attempts to use malicious or outdated packages with these names. Overall, these factors indicate the package is likely designed to execute unexpected code during installation, which is a common vector for malicious behavior."
