      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication immediately upon module execution. The data exfiltration includes potentially sensitive file paths and environment details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The presence of multiple hostname and path checks to exclude certain environments suggests evasion techniques to avoid detection in analysis or developer machines. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The code's behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including host fingerprinting, stealthy data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server, and conditional execution to evade detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
