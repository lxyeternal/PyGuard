It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (en47d1uz958z2v9.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party service often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, commonly abused for data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and the code suppresses error logging for the network request, indicating an attempt to operate stealthily. The collection and exfiltration of host-specific and user-sensitive information without legitimate purpose or user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. The hardcoded external endpoint and the immediate transmission of detailed environment and user data strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with known malware patterns for information stealing and remote reconnaissance."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This script can execute arbitrary code during the installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the package lists itself '@serenity-web/common-assets' as a dependency, which can cause recursive or unexpected behavior. The combination of a self-dependency and a preinstall script is suspicious and could be used to execute malicious code during installation."
