      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata without any user interaction or consent. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. It performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, effectively leaking system fingerprinting data. Furthermore, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain, again without user notification or legitimate purpose. The code suppresses error logging for network operations, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive environment data, DNS exfiltration, and HTTP POST to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a classic pattern of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration. There is no benign or legitimate functionality apparent in the code, and the behavior aligns strongly with known malware techniques for stealthy information theft and command-and-control communication."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
