      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, and package metadata without any user interaction or consent. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. The code performs multiple DNS lookups to these constructed queries, effectively exfiltrating host fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The absence of error logging and user notification, combined with the covert exfiltration of sensitive system and user information to an attacker-controlled domain, strongly indicates malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads."
