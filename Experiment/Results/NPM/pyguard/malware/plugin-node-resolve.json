It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication immediately upon module execution, indicating automated data exfiltration. The use of hostname and path checks to selectively avoid sending data on certain environments suggests evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The pattern of gathering sensitive environment and system data and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without user interaction or consent is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to run malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-node-resolve' and version '99.10.9' are unusual and may be attempting to impersonate a legitimate package. The description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated to the package name, which is another red flag. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
