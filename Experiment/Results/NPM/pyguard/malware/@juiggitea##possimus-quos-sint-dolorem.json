      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares an unusually large number of dependencies with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The dependencies are all scoped under three suspicious namespaces (@firantea, @juiggitea, @npmteasources, @womhla6stea) with similar naming patterns, which is a common tactic to obfuscate malicious packages. There are no scripts defined except a placeholder test script, which suggests the package relies heavily on these dependencies. Such a pattern is typical of a dependency confusion or supply chain attack, where malicious code is hidden inside many small packages to evade detection. Without further source code, this package.json alone strongly indicates a high risk of malicious behavior due to suspicious dependency structure and naming."
