      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node app.js' before installation. This means that any code inside app.js will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, downloading additional payloads, or modifying the system. Additionally, the 'main' field is set to 'node app.js', which is not a valid entry point (it should be a file path, not a command), suggesting possible obfuscation or misuse. Without the actual app.js code, the presence of a preinstall script running arbitrary code is suspicious and potentially malicious."
