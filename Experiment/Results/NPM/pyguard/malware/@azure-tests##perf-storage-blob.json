      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names that are sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The code accesses sensitive environment and system information and transmits it to an attacker-controlled server, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code for this behavior, and the use of interactsh.com strongly suggests command-and-control or data leakage intent. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
