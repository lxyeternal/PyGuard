Immediately after the download finishes, it executes this downloaded file using the child_process.exec function. This sequence of network retrieval of an executable file followed by immediate execution without any user interaction, validation, or error handling is a classic hallmark of malware behavior. The use of a .lnk file (Windows shortcut) as the downloaded payload is suspicious and can be used to execute arbitrary commands or payloads. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code snippet for downloading and executing a remote file silently. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including remote payload retrieval, local persistence, and arbitrary code execution, all without user consent or notification."
