      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, and package metadata without any user consent or notification. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS queries to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious domain. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The code performs network communication immediately upon execution, without error logging or user interaction, indicating stealthy exfiltration. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of reconnaissance and data exfiltration used by malware, especially supply chain or post-installation malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the description 'bitfinex whitehat package' may be an attempt to appear trustworthy, but the lack of author information and the unusual version number '99.10.10' are also suspicious. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
