      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes obfuscated shell commands based on the operating system platform. For Windows, it runs a heavily base64-encoded PowerShell command with the '-ep bypass' flag, which disables script execution policy restrictions, allowing potentially malicious scripts to run undetected. The encoded command is extremely long and obfuscated, a common malware technique to evade detection and analysis. For Linux, it decodes a base64 string that contains shell commands to remove files, execute scripts, and redirect output, which is then piped directly to bash for execution. This pattern of base64 decoding followed by immediate shell execution is a classic hallmark of malware delivering and running hidden payloads. The code uses 'child_process.exec' to run these commands without any user interaction or notification, and there is no legitimate business logic or documentation explaining the purpose. The use of obfuscated, encoded commands executed directly on the system, combined with platform-specific payloads that perform file operations and script execution, strongly indicates malicious intent, such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise."
