      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This exfiltration of system and user data without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft behavior. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused by malware authors for stealthy data collection. Furthermore, the code executes immediately upon import (via an immediately invoked async function assigned to 'main'), without any user interaction or legitimate purpose, and exports this promise, indicating it is designed to run automatically. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, no error handling around the critical exfiltration step, and no documentation or indication that this data collection is authorized. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern of collecting host-specific information and sending it to an external hardcoded webhook URL without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious activity."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'hngularjs' is similar to the popular 'angularjs' package, which suggests it might be attempting dependency confusion or typosquatting. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further hints at this intent. Without inspecting the contents of 'new.js', the presence of this preinstall script is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior."
