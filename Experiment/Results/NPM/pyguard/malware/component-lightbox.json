It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (r3vy732g4s9wwpln4vt4m6m2etkk8m7aw.oastify.com), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domain used resembles those commonly employed for testing exfiltration or command-and-control in malicious contexts. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name and versioning (99.0.1) along with the author email and description appear unusual and may be an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious activity."
