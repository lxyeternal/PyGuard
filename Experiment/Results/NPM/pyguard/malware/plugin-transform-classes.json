It encodes this data in a custom hex and dotted format, constructs DNS queries, and performs DNS lookups to a suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). It then sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and uses multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. The data exfiltration of sensitive environment and system information to a hardcoded, non-standard external server, combined with stealthy network communication and lack of legitimate purpose or user notification, strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-classes' and version '99.10.9' seem unusual and may be attempting to masquerade as a legitimate package. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
