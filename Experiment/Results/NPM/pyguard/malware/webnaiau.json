It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ccvcq1w2vtc00004hmxgggpsmohyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domain used is similar to those commonly employed for testing exfiltration or command-and-control in malware. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including unauthorized data exfiltration of environment and user-specific information to an attacker-controlled server without legitimate purpose or transparency."
