It serializes this data into JSON and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cgefohl5s4m2d17pkof0txtatbxkbdizh.oast.site), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domain used is typical of out-of-band interaction testing or attacker-controlled endpoints. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The absence of legitimate business logic or user-facing features, combined with direct network exfiltration of sensitive environment and user data, classifies this code as malicious."
