Immediately after downloading, it executes these downloaded executables using shell commands. This pattern of automated remote payload retrieval and execution without any user interaction, consent, or validation is a classic hallmark of malware behavior. The code effectively enables arbitrary code execution on the host system by fetching and running potentially untrusted binaries from an external source. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality, no error recovery beyond logging, and no indication that these executables are safe or part of a normal application workflow. According to the provided knowledge points, such direct download and execution of external executables, especially with hardcoded URLs and no user notification, is a strong indicator of malicious intent and critical risk."
