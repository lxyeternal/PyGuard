      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, and the current user. It then echoes a specific string ('niroborg-npm-com-test') and performs a curl request to an external, suspicious domain (https://a8jwqfkw427wnp2pmoybsia960cr0io7.oastify.com). The output of these commands is piped through xxd and head, and then used in a DNS lookup to a callback server domain (bind9-or-callback-server.com). This sequence is a classic example of host reconnaissance and data exfiltration without user consent. The use of child_process.exec to run a complex shell command that combines system information gathering and network communication to an attacker-controlled domain is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling that would justify this behavior. The pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as automated data exfiltration, system fingerprinting, and communication with suspicious external endpoints, all without user notification or consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation without visible output can be used to execute malicious payloads or perform unwanted actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has no dependencies and minimal metadata, which can be a tactic to avoid detection. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the hidden preinstall script is a red flag for potential malicious activity."
