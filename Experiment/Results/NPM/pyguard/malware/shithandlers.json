      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link) into the 'node_modules' directory without user interaction or consent. After downloading, it sets up a file watcher on the downloaded executable and executes it whenever the file changes. Additionally, the code executes the downloaded executable immediately upon detecting a modification event. This behavior is a classic pattern of automated remote payload retrieval and execution, which is strongly associated with malware. The use of exec to run an arbitrary executable fetched from an external source, combined with the lack of any legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling for the network operation, indicates a high risk of malicious intent. The code also calls a function named 'sendDiscordWebhook' after download, which suggests potential data exfiltration or communication with an attacker-controlled endpoint, although the function's implementation is missing. Overall, the code automates the download and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote source without user consent, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."

The name resembles legitimate Discord-related packages but is likely a typo-squatting or malicious package designed to execute harmful code when installed or used. Without further code inspection, this dependency alone raises a red flag for potential malicious behavior."
