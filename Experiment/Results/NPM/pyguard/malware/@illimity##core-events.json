      "malicious_behavior": "The code assigns a hardcoded external IP URL (http://129.152.20.51/core-events/index.js) directly to document.location, which causes the browser to navigate to and load a remote JavaScript file from an untrusted source without any user interaction or notification. This pattern is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior because it enables automatic retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote server, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, payload delivery, or further compromise of the host environment. The use of a raw IP address instead of a domain name, lack of error handling, and absence of any legitimate user-facing purpose further increase suspicion. This behavior aligns with known malware techniques for remote payload retrieval and execution, making it highly likely to be malicious."

This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious because it downloads and possibly executes code from an untrusted external source without user consent, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or compromise of the system."
