It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from local system data, which is a common reconnaissance technique. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation of hostname, username, and path, likely to evade detection on certain environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. The combination of gathering sensitive environment details and sending them to an external, suspicious domain without notification or authorization is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious intent."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process without any clear reason or safeguards. Such behavior is commonly used by malicious packages to run harmful scripts or compromise the system during installation."
