      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated, using multiple layers of encoded strings and indirect function calls, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. The code includes patterns strongly associated with malware, such as: obfuscated dynamic code execution, network requests to external hardcoded endpoints, reading of environment variables and user-specific directories, and exfiltration of data via HTTP POST requests. It constructs suspicious URLs and sends collected data (including environment and possibly user data) to external servers without user consent or notification. The code also uses setInterval to repeatedly execute functions that likely perform data collection and transmission. The obfuscation and lack of legitimate user-facing functionality, combined with network exfiltration and environment reconnaissance, are hallmark behaviors of malware, particularly credential or token stealers. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators from the knowledge base, including dynamic code execution from obfuscated payloads, environment and user data collection, and exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
