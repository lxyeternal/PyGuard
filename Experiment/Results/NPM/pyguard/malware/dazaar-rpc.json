      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. It performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, effectively exfiltrating host-specific data. Additionally, it sends a JSON string containing this sensitive information via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive data, DNS queries, and HTTP POST to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware behavior. There is no benign justification for this pattern in typical package code, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including unauthorized data collection and exfiltration to an external server."
