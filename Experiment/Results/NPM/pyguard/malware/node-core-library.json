      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data. It then sends this information silently to an external, hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml) via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs these network communications conditionally based on hostname, user, and path checks that appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns, as it profiles the host environment and exfiltrates sensitive system and user data to an attacker-controlled server without consent. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of obfuscated hex encoding, silent network communication, and conditional execution to avoid certain hosts further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'node-core-library' and version '99.10.9' are unusual and may be attempting to impersonate a core or trusted library. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
