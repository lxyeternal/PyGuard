      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code during package installation, potentially leading to malicious actions. Additionally, the package depends on itself '@playsistemico/core' with the same version, which is unusual and can cause recursive or unexpected behavior. The combination of a self-dependency and a preinstall script executing code from 'index.js' raises a strong suspicion of malicious or at least harmful behavior."
