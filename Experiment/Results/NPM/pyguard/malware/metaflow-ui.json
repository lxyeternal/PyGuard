It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (c5vdchsq4c0c7ld4pno0cf9pctayyyyyn.interact.sh) without any user consent, interaction, or notification. The domain name appears random and unrelated to any legitimate service, indicating a likely attacker-controlled endpoint. The code suppresses error logging for the network request, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data collection and exfiltration. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, data exfiltration, and communication with a suspicious external server. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and unauthorized data exfiltration."
