      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains an unusually large number of dependencies with suspicious and non-standard package names, many of which appear to be scoped under similar but slightly different namespaces (e.g., '@lbnqduy', '@lbnqduy180500', '@nqduy1805', '@nqduy180500', '@libphamton', '@oraliepham'). This pattern is often used to obfuscate or distribute malicious code across multiple packages. Additionally, some dependencies are fetched directly from GitHub repositories, which can be a vector for injecting malicious code. The package names themselves are nonsensical or randomly generated, which is a common tactic to evade detection. There are no scripts defined that would immediately execute malicious code on install, but the sheer volume and nature of dependencies strongly suggest that the package is designed to pull in potentially harmful or backdoored code. Without further inspection of the actual code in these dependencies, the package should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious."
