It then immediately sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external callback URL ('http://your-callback-url.com'). This pattern of gathering host-specific data and exfiltrating it to an external server without user notification or legitimate purpose is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. The absence of any error handling beyond logging, lack of user-facing functionality, and the direct coupling of environment data collection with network transmission aligns with known malware patterns for host fingerprinting and potential further exploitation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. The description states it retrieves user information and sends it to a callback URL, which suggests that the 'index.js' script may be designed to exfiltrate user data during installation. This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, as it executes code during package installation that could compromise user privacy or security."
