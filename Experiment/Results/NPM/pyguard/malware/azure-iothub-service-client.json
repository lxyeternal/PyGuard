      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects extensive system information, including the current username, kernel details, contents of /etc/passwd, public and private IP addresses, and the current working directory. It also creates a directory and writes a file in /tmp, a sensitive temporary location. The collected data, including the output of these commands and the content of the created file, is then sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint not related to any legitimate application purpose. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive system information without user consent or notification. The use of exec to run multiple shell commands, the collection of sensitive files like /etc/passwd, and the transmission of this data to an external webhook are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and exfiltration. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL combined with system reconnaissance and data exfiltration matches multiple critical risk patterns associated with malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data collection, and covert network communication. Therefore, this code is malicious."
