      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares an unusually large number of dependencies, all with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The package names appear to be random Latin-like phrases, which is a common tactic to evade detection. There are no scripts defined except a default failing test script, which is suspicious because malicious packages often hide payloads in install or postinstall scripts, but the absence of scripts here combined with the suspicious dependency list suggests the actual malicious code is likely hidden inside these dependencies. The dependencies are all scoped under multiple unknown namespaces (@diotobtea, @erboladaiteas, @hishpr, @juiggitea, @patrten, @taktikangea), which is unusual and may indicate a dependency chain designed to obfuscate malicious code. This pattern is typical of malware or typosquatting packages that attempt to inject malicious code through transitive dependencies. Without direct access to the dependency code, the presence of so many suspicious dependencies strongly indicates malicious intent."
