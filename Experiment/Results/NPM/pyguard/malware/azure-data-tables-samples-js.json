      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information in a custom hex-based format and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data targeting a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed names and sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request without any user interaction or notification. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation function that appears designed to evade detection on certain hostnames or paths, indicating stealth behavior. The domain used is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate service. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate functionality or user-facing features. This pattern of host fingerprinting combined with covert data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and information stealing behavior consistent with malware or supply chain attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
