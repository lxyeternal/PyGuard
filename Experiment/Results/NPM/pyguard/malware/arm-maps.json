      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently, uses multiple heuristic checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths (likely to evade detection or analysis), and performs network communication to an attacker-controlled server. This behavior is consistent with host fingerprinting and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The combination of gathering sensitive environment data and exfiltrating it to a suspicious external server without user knowledge or consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
