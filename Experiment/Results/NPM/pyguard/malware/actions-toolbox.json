It constructs a hostname based on environment variables and sends system data including environment variables, process list, kernel and network configuration files, and sensitive files like /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow encoded in base64 via HTTP POST requests to a suspicious domain (burpcollaborator.net). It also attempts to ping this domain. This behavior is indicative of data theft and unauthorized information disclosure, which is malicious."
