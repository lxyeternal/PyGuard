It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion techniques to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The overall pattern—silent collection of sensitive host data and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled domain—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with malware reconnaissance and data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Since the content of 'index.js' is unknown, this behavior is potentially dangerous and commonly used in malicious packages to execute harmful actions during installation."
