      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata without any user interaction or consent. It encodes this data into hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, likely to signal or exfiltrate data covertly. Additionally, it sends a POST request containing the serialized system information to the same suspicious external domain over HTTPS. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server, use of hardcoded suspicious domains, lack of user notification or consent, and network communication immediately following sensitive data collection. The code structure is generic and obfuscated by encoding data in hex and constructing complex DNS queries, which is a common evasion technique. No error handling or logging is present to alert users or administrators. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the description 'bitfinex whitehat package' might be an attempt to appear trustworthy, but the lack of author information and the unusual version number '99.10.9' are also suspicious."
