      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from system data, which is a common reconnaissance and exfiltration technique. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The overall behavior matches known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name and version appear unusual (version 99.10.9) and the description is vague ('azure package'), which may indicate an attempt to impersonate a legitimate package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious code execution."
