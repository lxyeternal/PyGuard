It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The domain used is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate package purpose. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, data exfiltration, stealthy network communication, and lack of legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation. There is no benign justification for collecting and transmitting such detailed system information to an external server in this manner. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package has no author information and a very generic description ('azure package'), which can be signs of a potentially malicious or untrustworthy package."
