      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data into a hex-encoded string combined with network and path information, then performs DNS lookups on a suspicious, hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml). If certain conditions on hostname, username, and paths are met (mostly to exclude known or local environments), it sends this collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently, uses generic function names, and performs network communication immediately upon module execution. The domain used is not related to any legitimate service and is likely attacker-controlled. This pattern of host fingerprinting combined with silent exfiltration of system and user environment data to an external server is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, no error handling or logging for network operations, and no indication that this data collection is for benign purposes. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
