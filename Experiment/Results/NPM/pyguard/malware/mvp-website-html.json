It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (wfoqzyvftvpbltythqrsf0g0w1cl51xn3.oast.fun), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domain used is typical of testing or malicious exfiltration endpoints. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

This is suspicious because it attempts to fetch data from an unknown and potentially malicious domain during the installation process. Such behavior can be used to exfiltrate data, download malicious payloads, or perform other harmful actions without the user's consent."
