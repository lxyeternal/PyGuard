      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including all local network interface IP addresses, the current OS username, the hostname, and the public IP address by querying an external service. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive host information without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The code runs automatically upon import (immediately invoked async function), with no user interaction or legitimate purpose evident. There is minimal error handling and no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled external service. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'adgularjs' is a typo-squatting attempt on the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. Without the actual 'new.js' file content, the exact malicious actions cannot be confirmed, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior."
