      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names that include sensitive information, then performs DNS lookups to a hardcoded suspicious domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with error handling suppressing any errors, and no legitimate user-facing functionality is present. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive data, DNS queries to an attacker-controlled domain, and HTTP POST exfiltration to a hardcoded suspicious endpoint is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, as it gathers and leaks sensitive environment and user information to an external attacker-controlled server without authorization."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
