      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and environment information including OS details, environment variables, CPU info, network interfaces (excluding loopback and localhost), current working directory, user info, and package metadata. It then serializes this data to JSON, compresses it using Brotli with high compression settings, and encodes it in base64. The code contains a large base64-encoded, Brotli-compressed string which is decompressed and immediately executed via eval. This pattern of multi-layered obfuscation (unicode escapes, base64 encoding, Brotli compression) combined with dynamic code execution (eval) is a classic hallmark of malware. The code also disables NODE_NO_EVAl environment variable to ensure eval is enabled, indicating intent to execute hidden payloads. There is no user interaction, no legitimate purpose documented, and the executed payload is hidden in the encoded string, which strongly suggests it is malicious. The behavior matches known malware patterns of host fingerprinting followed by execution of a concealed payload, likely for reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or further compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json references scripts named 'init.js' and 'rsh.js' inside the 'scripts' folder, and the 'test' and 'init' scripts execute 'init.js'. The repository URL points to 'hktalent/rshNpm', which is suspicious given the script names. The description field is 'aDriv', which is unclear and possibly obfuscated. The presence of scripts with names like 'rsh.js' (which could stand for 'remote shell') and the execution of 'init.js' on test/init scripts suggests potential for executing arbitrary or malicious code. Additionally, the 'files' field explicitly excludes README, .npmignore, .github, .git, 'ps.sh', and 'node_modules', which could be an attempt to hide certain files from the package contents. Without the actual script contents, this is suspicious and indicative of possible malicious behavior."
