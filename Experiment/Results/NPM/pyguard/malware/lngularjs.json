It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user identity data to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL used as an exfiltration channel is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code runs immediately upon import (via an immediately invoked async function), performing this data collection and transmission silently, without any legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling that would indicate benign use. These factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unauthorized data exfiltration, use of hardcoded external endpoints, and collection of sensitive environment information without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'lngularjs' is a typo-squatting variant of 'angularjs', and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository and author information point to a GitHub user named 'serialfuzzer', which may be related to security research or exploitation. Overall, the combination of a preinstall script executing a local file and the naming suggests potential malicious intent."
