      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata without any user consent or notification. It encodes this data in hexadecimal and constructs DNS queries to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in offensive security and malware contexts. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. The code performs these network communications silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating an intent to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive system information. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding data, DNS lookups to attacker-controlled domains, and HTTP POST exfiltration to a hardcoded suspicious domain is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code for this data collection and transmission, and the domain used is not related to the package or any known benign service. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
