      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link) and saves it locally as 'README.txt.lnk' in the current directory. Immediately after the download finishes, it executes this downloaded file using the child_process.exec function. This pattern—automatic retrieval of a remote file and immediate execution without user interaction or validation—is a classic hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The use of a .lnk file (Windows shortcut) as the payload is suspicious, as it can be used to execute arbitrary commands or payloads. There is no error handling or user notification, and the code runs automatically upon import or execution. This behavior enables remote code execution of potentially untrusted code, which is a critical security risk and strongly indicative of malicious intent."
