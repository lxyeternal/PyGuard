It encodes this data in a custom hex and dotted format, constructs DNS query names, and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml). It then sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same external domain without any user consent or notification. The code includes multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. The data exfiltration is done silently with suppressed error handling and no legitimate user-facing functionality. The domain used is not related to any known benign service and the pattern of gathering host environment data and exfiltrating it to an external server is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no indication of legitimate purpose or user interaction, and the code runs automatically on import or execution. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware or spyware."
