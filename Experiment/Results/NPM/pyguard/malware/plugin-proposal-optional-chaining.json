      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently, uses obfuscated hex encoding for data, and sends the collected data to an attacker-controlled server over HTTPS. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. This pattern of host fingerprinting combined with stealthy data exfiltration to a suspicious external domain is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and information stealing malware. The absence of error logging, the use of hardcoded suspicious domains, and the exfiltration of sensitive environment and file system data without user consent confirm the code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to run malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-proposal-optional-chaining' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to any known legitimate package, and the description 'azure package' is vague. The combination of an unusual preinstall script and misleading metadata suggests potential malicious intent."
