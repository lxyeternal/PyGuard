      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script executes several suspicious commands that indicate malicious behavior. It constructs a hostname using environment variables and attempts to ping a domain under 'burpcollaborator.net', which is a domain commonly used for security testing and can be abused for data exfiltration. The script then runs multiple system commands ('env', 'ps aux', reading various /proc files, and sensitive system files like /etc/hosts, /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow), encodes their output in base64, and sends this data via HTTP POST requests to the constructed remote server. This behavior is indicative of an attempt to collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information to an external attacker-controlled server. Additionally, it tries a fallback ping to a Windows variant of the hostname. Overall, this package contains a malicious preinstall script designed to steal system information."
