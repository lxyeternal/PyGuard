It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. This behavior is consistent with malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns, as it profiles the host environment and sends sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to a suspicious domain for sending encoded system data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware exfiltration techniques."
