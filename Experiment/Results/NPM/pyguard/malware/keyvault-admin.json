      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed domain names based on the collected data, which is a form of covert data exfiltration. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The data exfiltration is done silently with suppressed error handling and no logging, indicating stealth. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, which is a hallmark of malware or supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
