      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes potentially sensitive environment and file system information, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion techniques to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The overall behavior matches known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure, indicating that this code is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-member-expression-literals' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to known legitimate packages, and the description 'azure package' is vague. The absence of author information and the presence of a preinstall script that executes code without clear purpose is a common tactic in malicious packages to run unwanted code on the user's system during installation."
