      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data. It then sends this information silently to an external, hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml) via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs these network communications conditionally based on hostname, username, and path checks that appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns, as it profiles the host environment and exfiltrates sensitive system and user information to an attacker-controlled server without consent. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of obfuscated checks, silent error handling, and hardcoded suspicious external endpoints strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious payloads or compromise the system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JavaScript file is a common tactic used in malicious packages."
