It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (h1jach48nx4ix19npdktzgdo8feh29qy.oastify.com) without any user consent, notification, or legitimate purpose. The domain used is not related to the package or any known trusted service, indicating data exfiltration. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, which suggests an attempt to avoid detection. There is no benign or user-facing functionality associated with this data collection and transmission. This pattern of gathering host-specific and user-specific information and sending it to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and exfiltration behavior, consistent with known malware techniques."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the description and author fields mention 'psycho_012 hackerone', which may be an attempt to appear legitimate but could be misleading. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but running code at preinstall is a common vector for malicious behavior."
