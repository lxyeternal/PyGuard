It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (zu57dbl18f7p9a7284pd4mgc3.canarytokens.com), which is a suspicious endpoint commonly used for detecting exfiltration or as a canary token. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering host-specific and user-sensitive information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
