      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, package version, and the entire package.json content. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (eoyrkzanfqytop3.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party service often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, commonly abused for data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and the code suppresses error logging for the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The collection and exfiltration of environment and user-specific data without legitimate purpose or transparency is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. The use of a hardcoded suspicious external domain for data exfiltration, combined with gathering detailed host and user information, matches multiple critical risk patterns associated with malware and supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with unauthorized data exfiltration."
