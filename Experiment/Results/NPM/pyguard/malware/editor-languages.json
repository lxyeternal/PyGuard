The data sent includes the current username, working directory, hostname, and potentially sensitive AWS IAM security credentials fetched from the instance metadata service (http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/flaws). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and unauthorized information disclosure, which is malicious."
