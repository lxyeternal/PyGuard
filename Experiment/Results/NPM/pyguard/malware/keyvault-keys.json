      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata without any user consent or notification. It encodes this data in hexadecimal and constructs DNS queries to a suspicious hardcoded domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. The code performs these network communications silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating an intent to stealthily exfiltrate sensitive environment and system information. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding data, DNS lookups to attacker-controlled domains, and HTTP POST exfiltration to a hardcoded suspicious endpoint is a strong hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code for such actions, and the domain used is not related to the package or any known benign service. Therefore, this code is malicious."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
