It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ck0mck22vtc0000a6gkggjokgjoyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is not related to any legitimate service. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses errors silently, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The collection and exfiltration of host-specific and user-sensitive data to an attacker-controlled endpoint without any legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, as it enables attackers to fingerprint the host environment and potentially prepare for further exploitation or targeted attacks."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized code, downloading malware, or compromising the system. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially given the package name and description referencing 'HackerOne Tester', which may indicate testing or exploitation purposes."
