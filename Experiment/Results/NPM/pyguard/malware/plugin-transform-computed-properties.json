      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. The data exfiltration includes potentially sensitive environment and file system information, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The overall pattern—collecting host-specific data and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without user knowledge—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with credential or asset theft and system fingerprinting. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation without any clear reason or documentation. The package name and version are unusual and the description is vague ('azure package'), which could be an attempt to appear legitimate. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but running code at preinstall is a common vector for malicious activity such as installing backdoors, stealing credentials, or modifying the environment."
