      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, current user, a fixed string ('fiji-core-foc'), and the public IP address (via curl to https://ifconfig.me). It then encodes this collected data into a hex string and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external endpoint (https://eozpdddh3tifjo.m.pipedream.net). This sequence of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without user consent or notification is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. The use of exec to run shell commands, the lack of legitimate user-facing functionality, the hardcoded suspicious external URL, and the immediate network transmission of sensitive data strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This script executes a Node.js file named 'index.js' silently (redirecting all output to /dev/null), which is a common technique to hide potentially malicious activity during installation. The description states it is a 'proof of concept for dependency confusion', which is a known attack vector where a malicious package is published with the same name as an internal package to trick package managers into installing the malicious version. The presence of this preinstall script combined with the description strongly suggests this package is designed to execute hidden code during installation, which is suspicious and potentially malicious."
