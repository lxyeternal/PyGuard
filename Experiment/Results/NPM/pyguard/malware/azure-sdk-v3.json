      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated using an array of encoded strings and an index-mapping function, which is a common evasion technique. The code collects extensive system information including OS hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, and file listings from sensitive directories such as the user's home and root directories. It then encodes this data and constructs DNS queries with dynamically generated domain names that include this encoded information, targeting a suspicious hardcoded domain '425a2.rt11.ml'. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication to an external server, which is a classic data exfiltration pattern. The combination of obfuscation, system reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration to a hardcoded external endpoint strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or spyware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code, and it matches multiple critical risk patterns such as host fingerprinting, stealthy network communication, and exfiltration of sensitive user and system data."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'azure-sdk-v3' and version '99.10.11' do not correspond to official Azure SDK naming conventions, suggesting it may be a typosquatting or impersonation attempt. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious code, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
