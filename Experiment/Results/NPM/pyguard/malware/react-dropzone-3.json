This pattern of decrypting and dynamically executing code from a local file without user interaction or validation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded cryptographic key and cipher mode to hide the payload, combined with eval() execution, is a classic obfuscation and payload delivery technique commonly used in malware. The code runs automatically upon module import or execution, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling, and the decrypted code is executed silently, increasing the risk of stealthy malicious activity. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators consistent with malware, including payload decryption, dynamic code execution, and stealthy file manipulation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node install.js' before installation. This script can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during the package installation process. Additionally, the version number '900.9.9' is unusually high and the description 'For use by FireEye only.' suggests it may be a targeted or internal package. Without the content of 'install.js', it is impossible to verify the safety of this script, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom JS file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
