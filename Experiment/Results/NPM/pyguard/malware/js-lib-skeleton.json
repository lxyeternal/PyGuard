      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata. It encodes this data into hex strings and constructs DNS query names targeting a suspicious hardcoded domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com), which is a known domain used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. The code performs multiple DNS lookups to this domain with encoded system data embedded in the queries, which is a covert data exfiltration technique. Additionally, it sends a POST request over HTTPS to the same suspicious domain, transmitting a JSON string containing detailed system and user information without any user consent or notification. The data collected and exfiltrated includes sensitive environment and network details that can be used for reconnaissance or further exploitation. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code for this behavior, and no error handling or logging is present to indicate transparency. The use of a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain for data exfiltration, combined with the stealthy DNS queries and HTTP POST of sensitive system information, is a strong indicator of malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance payloads."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
