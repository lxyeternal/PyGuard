It then serializes this information into JSON and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This webhook URL is an external endpoint controlled by a third party, which is a common exfiltration technique. The data collected is personal and system-specific, and the transmission occurs without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The code executes immediately upon import or execution (due to the immediately invoked async function), indicating automatic data exfiltration. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL combined with the collection and transmission of system and user information without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during installation, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'aagularjs' is a typo-squatting attempt on the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository and author information point to a user named 'serialfuzzer', which is known for security research and potentially malicious test packages. Overall, the preinstall script combined with the naming and keywords strongly indicate malicious intent."
