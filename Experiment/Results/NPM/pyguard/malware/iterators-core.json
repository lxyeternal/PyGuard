      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on crafted query names derived from local system data, which is a known reconnaissance and exfiltration technique. The conditional isValid function attempts to exclude certain hostnames and paths, likely to evade detection or avoid running in analysis environments, indicating evasion tactics. The overall behavior is consistent with automated host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server, without any legitimate purpose or user consent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including system profiling, stealthy network communication to suspicious endpoints, and exfiltration of sensitive environment and file system data. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package has no author information and a misleading version number (99.10.9), which can be signs of a potentially malicious or untrustworthy package."
