      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link) and saves it locally as 'README.txt.lnk' in the current directory. Immediately after the download finishes, it executes this downloaded file using the child_process.exec function. This pattern of fetching a remote file and executing it without any user interaction, validation, or consent is a classic hallmark of malware behavior. The use of a .lnk file (Windows shortcut) as the payload is suspicious because it can be used to launch arbitrary commands or executables. There is no error handling or logging, indicating an attempt to operate stealthily. The code does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this operation. The direct coupling of network retrieval with shell execution, especially from an untrusted external source, is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or remote code execution malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
