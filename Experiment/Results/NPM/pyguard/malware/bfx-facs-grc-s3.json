      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names that include sensitive information, then performs DNS lookups to a hardcoded suspicious domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is stealthy, with error handling suppressing errors and no logging or user interaction. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and user data, encoding it, performing DNS queries, and sending it to a hardcoded external server strongly indicates malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code for this behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm if it is malicious, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
