      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths without user consent. It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml), which is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration. The code performs these actions silently without user interaction or notification, suppresses errors, and uses multiple heuristics to avoid execution on certain hostnames or paths, suggesting evasion techniques. The combination of gathering sensitive environment data and sending it to an external, hardcoded server without legitimate purpose or user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and exfiltration behavior. There is no benign or documented functionality justifying this behavior, and the code runs automatically upon import or execution, further indicating malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-dotall-regex' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to known legitimate packages, and the description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated. The combination of an unusual preinstall script and vague metadata suggests potential malicious intent."
