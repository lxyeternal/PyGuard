      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in a custom hex-based format and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data targeting a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). The data exfiltration occurs silently without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors during file system access, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The isValid function attempts to exclude certain hostnames and paths, likely to evade analysis or sandbox environments. The code performs DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from system info, which is a known covert channel technique. Finally, it sends the collected data via HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding, and silent exfiltration to a suspicious external domain is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'web-types' and version '99.10.9' are unusual and may be attempting to impersonate legitimate packages. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious activity."
