It then exfiltrates this data by sending it in multiple HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint not related to any legitimate application purpose. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL used for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code performs no user interaction, consent, or notification, and sends potentially sensitive environment data without any legitimate reason. This behavior matches multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including host fingerprinting, environment reconnaissance, and unauthorized data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code during package installation, potentially leading to malicious actions. Additionally, the package depends on itself ('cloudflare-docs-theme' with a very high version number), which is unusual and may be an attempt to confuse or create a dependency loop. The combination of a self-referential dependency and a preinstall script suggests potential malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior that warrants further inspection of the 'index.js' file."
