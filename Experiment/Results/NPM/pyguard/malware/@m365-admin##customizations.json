      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads a local file named 'install.json', parses its content as JSON, decrypts the 'content' field using AES-256-CTR with a hardcoded key and the provided IV, and then immediately executes the decrypted code using eval. This pattern of decrypting and dynamically executing code from a local file without any user interaction or validation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of a hardcoded cryptographic key to conceal the payload, combined with eval on decrypted content, is a classic obfuscation and payload delivery technique commonly used in malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior, and the code executes automatically upon module import or execution, which is typical for supply chain or runtime infection vectors. This dynamic code execution from an encrypted payload is a high-risk pattern strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution, evasion of static analysis, and potential further compromise of the host system."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node install.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Additionally, the description explicitly states that if the package is installed, it could give control over the machine to the author, indicating intentional malicious behavior or at least a proof-of-concept for a supply chain attack. The package appears to be created for ethical hacking and bug bounty demonstration purposes, but the presence of a preinstall script that can execute code without user consent is a common vector for malicious activity."
