It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (https://clgt.cc/dependency-conf-npm.php) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The domain is suspicious and unrelated to the package's stated purpose. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive system and user information to an external server, lack of error logging (errors are suppressed), no legitimate user-facing functionality, and automatic execution upon module load. The combination of gathering host-specific information and transmitting it externally without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, downloading malware, or stealing information. Without inspecting 'index.js', this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious."
