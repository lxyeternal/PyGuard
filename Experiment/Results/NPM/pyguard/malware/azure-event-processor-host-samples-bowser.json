      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data. It then sends this information silently to an external, hardcoded domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from local system data, which is a known reconnaissance and exfiltration technique. The conditional checks in isValid() appear designed to evade detection on certain hostnames or paths, indicating stealth behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and system data, encoding it, and exfiltrating it to a suspicious external server without consent is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions without user consent. Since the 'index.js' file is not provided, its contents are unknown, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
