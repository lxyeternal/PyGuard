It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. It performs multiple DNS lookups to these constructed domain names without user consent or notification. Additionally, it sends a JSON string of the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The code runs automatically upon import or execution, silently exfiltrating sensitive system and user information to an attacker-controlled server. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious domains, lack of user consent, and stealthy network communication. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package name 'kotlinlang.org' mimics a well-known domain, which could be an attempt to deceive users. The description 'bitfinex whitehat package' might be a social engineering attempt to appear trustworthy. Without the content of 'index.js', the exact behavior cannot be determined, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a red flag for potential malicious activity."
