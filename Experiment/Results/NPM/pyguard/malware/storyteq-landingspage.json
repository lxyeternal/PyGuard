      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects system information (hostname and current user), appends a fixed string, and fetches the public IP address via a curl request to https://ifconfig.me. It then pipes this combined data through xxd (hex dump), head, and a while loop that performs DNS lookups to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (0uvmi555ekmfjbc31ckndc8go7u3it6i.oastify.com). This behavior is a classic example of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration via DNS queries to an attacker-controlled domain. The use of exec to run this complex shell command without user interaction or notification, combined with the collection and external transmission of sensitive system information, strongly indicates malicious intent. The domain used for DNS queries is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate application purpose. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated data exfiltration, system reconnaissance, and covert network communication. Therefore, the code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares a dependency on itself ('storyteq-landingspage' at version ^1.0.9), which creates a circular dependency that can cause unexpected behavior or infinite loops during installation. Additionally, the 'install' script runs 'node extract.js' which is not provided here, but running arbitrary scripts on install is a common vector for malicious behavior. The description states the package is a proof of concept to confirm installation on victim machines, which implies it is designed to detect or track installations, potentially without user consent. These factors combined indicate suspicious and potentially malicious behavior."
