      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, encoding of sensitive environment data, and transmission to an attacker-controlled server is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no benign justification for this behavior in typical npm packages, and the use of hardcoded suspicious domains for data exfiltration strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation without any tests or clear purpose. The package name and description ('plugin-proposal-unicode-property-regex' and 'azure package') do not match, which is unusual and may indicate an attempt to disguise malicious intent. Additionally, the 'author' field is empty and the license field is incorrectly capitalized as 'License' instead of 'license', which are signs of a potentially unmaintained or malicious package. Running code during 'preinstall' can be exploited to execute malicious scripts on the user's machine."
