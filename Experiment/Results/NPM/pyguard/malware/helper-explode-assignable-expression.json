      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and file listings from root directories (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the data collection. The use of DNS lookups with encoded host/path/user info and the subsequent HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain is a classic reconnaissance and data exfiltration pattern seen in malware. The absence of error logging, the obfuscated data encoding, and the targeting of sensitive system directories for file enumeration further indicate malicious intent. Overall, this code is performing unauthorized system fingerprinting and exfiltration of potentially sensitive information to a suspicious external server, consistent with malware behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package has no author information and a misleading description ('azure package') that does not clarify its purpose, which are common signs of potentially malicious or deceptive packages."
