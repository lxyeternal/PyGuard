      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is obfuscated and performs a network POST request to an external domain '3f241964ab40f0d30260cde55e73b9e4.m.pipedream.net', which is a known service often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, commonly abused for data exfiltration. The code collects all environment variables from process.env, serializes them to JSON, encodes the JSON string in base64, and sends this encoded data in the body of the POST request. There is no user interaction, no error handling, and the code immediately ends the request without any legitimate purpose or notification. The obfuscation, combined with the exfiltration of environment variables to an external, hardcoded endpoint, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including data exfiltration, obfuscation, and lack of transparency. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks that steal sensitive environment data without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json specifies a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node eogtktu.js' before installation. The filename 'eogtktu.js' is obfuscated and non-descriptive, which is suspicious. Running arbitrary JavaScript code during installation can execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'eogtktu.js', it is impossible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of an obfuscated script executed automatically during install is a common tactic used by malicious packages to run unauthorized code."
