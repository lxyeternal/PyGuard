      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known to be used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware and penetration testing. The code performs multiple DNS lookups to these constructed queries, effectively leaking system fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends a JSON string containing all collected information via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and network data, encoding it, and exfiltrating it to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code for this behavior, and it matches multiple critical risk patterns such as host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, and communication with suspicious external endpoints."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads or compromise the system. Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and is a common vector for malicious npm packages."
