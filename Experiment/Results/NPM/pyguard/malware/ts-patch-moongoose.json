      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code executes a highly obfuscated PowerShell command using Node.js's child_process.exec function. The command string is base64-encoded and passed to PowerShell with the '-ep bypass -e' flags, which instruct PowerShell to bypass execution policy and execute the encoded command. This technique is a well-known method for hiding malicious payloads and evading detection. The decoded PowerShell command runs in a hidden window, indicating an attempt to conceal its activity from the user. The obfuscation, use of encoded PowerShell commands, and execution without user interaction or notification are classic hallmarks of malware. Such behavior is strongly associated with executing unauthorized or harmful code, potentially for payload delivery, persistence, or data exfiltration. There is no legitimate or benign purpose for this pattern in typical JavaScript or Node.js applications, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code execution."
