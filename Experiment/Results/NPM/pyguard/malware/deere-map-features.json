It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (deere-map-features.cad9vme2vtc00000yq50gfgw74ryyyyyb.interact.sh), which is not related to any legitimate service or known API. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and the code suppresses error logging to avoid detection. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, specifically automated data exfiltration of sensitive environment and user information to an attacker-controlled server. The domain used is suspicious and likely attacker-controlled, consistent with command-and-control or reconnaissance activity. The absence of legitimate business logic, combined with the direct collection and exfiltration of host-specific data without user consent, classifies this code as malicious."

This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which can be used to run arbitrary or malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Since the content of 'index.js' is not provided, this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious."
