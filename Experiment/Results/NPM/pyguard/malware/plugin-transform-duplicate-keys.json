      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication conditionally based on hostname, user, and path checks, which appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The use of DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from system info further indicates covert data exfiltration techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, and the code runs automatically on import or execution. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, indicating the code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-duplicate-keys' with a very high version number and vague description 'azure package' may be an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious code, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
