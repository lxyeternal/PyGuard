      "malicious_behavior": "The code disables TLS certificate verification by setting process.env['NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED'] = 0, which is a common technique to bypass SSL security checks and facilitate communication with potentially untrusted servers. It then constructs a hidden directory path inside the user's home directory (~/.vscode), creates it if it does not exist, and downloads data from an external URL (https://npmrepos.com/checkupdate.php) using a synchronous HTTP GET request. The downloaded data is written directly to a file named 'jsontoken' inside that hidden directory. This behavior is suspicious because it silently fetches and stores data from an external, hardcoded URL into a user profile hidden folder without any user interaction, notification, or validation. The use of a generic filename 'jsontoken' suggests it may be storing sensitive tokens or credentials. The code lacks error handling or logging, indicating an intent to operate stealthily. The external domain 'npmrepos.com' is not a standard or widely recognized domain for legitimate package updates, raising further suspicion. Taken together, these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including network communication to a suspicious endpoint, writing to a hidden user directory, disabling SSL verification, and silent data retrieval without user consent. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'npm install sync-request' and then executes 'node main.js' before the package installation completes. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the 'main.js' file is not shown, so its behavior is unknown and could potentially contain harmful code. The use of 'sync-request' is also notable, as it allows synchronous HTTP requests which could be used to fetch malicious content during installation."
