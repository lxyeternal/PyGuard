      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares an unusually large number of dependencies, all with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The package and dependency names appear to be randomly generated Latin-like phrases, which is a common tactic used to evade detection and flood the dependency tree. This can be a sign of a malicious or typosquatting package designed to pull in many unknown packages that could contain malicious code. Additionally, there are no scripts defined except a placeholder test script, and no author or description is provided, which further suggests a lack of transparency. Without further code inspection, the presence of so many suspicious dependencies alone is a strong indicator of potential malicious intent or at least a high risk of supply chain compromise."
