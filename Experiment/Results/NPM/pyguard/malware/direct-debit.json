This domain is unrelated to any known legitimate service and appears to be attacker-controlled. The code checks if the response status is 200 and then logs a success message indicating the package was installed successfully. There is no legitimate user interaction, authentication, or documented purpose for this network call. The behavior of contacting an external, hardcoded, suspicious domain during package execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with reconnaissance or beaconing to a command-and-control server. Although the code does not perform direct data exfiltration or code execution beyond the network call, the presence of this network communication to a suspicious endpoint without user consent or legitimate purpose classifies it as malicious. This pattern aligns with known malware behaviors involving network communication to attacker-controlled domains during package installation or runtime."
