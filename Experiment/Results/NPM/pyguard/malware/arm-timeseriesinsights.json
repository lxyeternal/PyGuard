      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive locations (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed domain names based on the collected data, which is a known technique for covert data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. The data exfiltration is done silently with suppressed error handling and no logging, indicating an intent to avoid detection. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, constituting a high risk of malicious activity."
