It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). The data exfiltration occurs silently without user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs network communication to an attacker-controlled server, which is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration, indicating that the code is malicious."
