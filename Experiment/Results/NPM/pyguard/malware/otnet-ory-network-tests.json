It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ydfpycccdlf63zh24xrxe7st6kcb0aoz.oastify.com) without any user consent or notification. The domain appears to be a non-standard, likely attacker-controlled endpoint used for data exfiltration. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection or transmission. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data theft behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."

This behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious because it causes the package installation process to make an unsolicited network request, which could be used to exfiltrate data, download malicious payloads, or perform other harmful actions. Additionally, the description field states 'hijacked by faique', which suggests the package may have been compromised."
