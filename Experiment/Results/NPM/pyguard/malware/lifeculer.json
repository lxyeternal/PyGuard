      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to read a file named 'checker.json' from the system's temporary directory (%temp%) and parse it as JSON. If this file does not exist or the content is not as expected, it enters the catch block where it executes system commands to check for Python's presence by running 'python --version'. If Python is detected, it runs pip commands to install several Python packages (httpx, pycrypto, pypiwin32) without user consent, clears the console, and then runs a Python script 'main.py' in the background. This behavior indicates automated downloading and execution of potentially untrusted code. If Python is not detected, it writes a JSON file 'checker.json' with a flag to the temp directory, likely to mark the system as checked or infected. The use of shell commands, execution of external scripts, silent error suppression, and writing to temp directories for persistence or evasion are classic malware techniques. The code also uses multiple modules (child_process, node-cmd, shelljs) to execute shell commands, which increases the risk of arbitrary command execution. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation, and the code runs potentially harmful commands without user interaction or consent. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
