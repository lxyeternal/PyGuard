It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ck385ge2vtc00008gwb0gj1fxdeyyyyyr.oast.fun), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domain used is similar to those commonly employed for testing exfiltration or command-and-control in malicious contexts. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an attacker-controlled server is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
