It encodes this data into hex and constructs DNS query names that are sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known to be used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware contexts. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious domain. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication immediately upon execution, indicating stealthy data exfiltration. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding, DNS queries, and HTTP POST to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
