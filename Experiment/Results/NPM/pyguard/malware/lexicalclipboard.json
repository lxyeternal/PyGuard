      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including hostname, platform type, user information, and current working directory without any user interaction or consent. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external domain (eohrcqzfk3223us.m.pipedream.net), which is a suspicious endpoint commonly used for testing or exfiltration. Additionally, the code writes a local file named 'locatethisfileforpoc' with the content 'execution achieved', which may be used as a marker or persistence indicator. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. The absence of error handling for the network request and the silent exfiltration of system and user data strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious scripts that run 'node index.js --save-prod' during preinstall, postinstall, and start phases. Running arbitrary code during install phases is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the presence of both 'request' and 'requests' dependencies is unusual; 'requests' is a very small and uncommon package that could be malicious or a typo. The combination of these factors suggests potential malicious intent, as the package executes code automatically on installation and startup without clear purpose."
