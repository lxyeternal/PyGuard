It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (eon84z9ti0r7hjk.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party service often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, commonly abused for data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded, suspicious endpoint without consent is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware patterns."

This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Without inspecting 'index.js', this is suspicious because it can run arbitrary code on the user's machine without explicit consent."
