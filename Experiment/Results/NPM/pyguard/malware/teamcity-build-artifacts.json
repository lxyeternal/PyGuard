      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, and package metadata. It encodes this data into hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and malware C2 communication. It performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, effectively exfiltrating host fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends a JSON string containing this sensitive information via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The code lacks error logging and user interaction, indicating stealth. The combination of gathering sensitive environment data and exfiltrating it to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code for such behavior, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including host fingerprinting, data exfiltration, and communication with suspicious external endpoints."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
