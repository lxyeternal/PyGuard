      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names that include sensitive information, then performs DNS lookups to a hardcoded suspicious domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a known domain used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is stealthy, with error handling suppressing errors and no logging or user interaction. The combination of gathering sensitive host and user environment data and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled domain is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code for this behavior, and the use of interactsh.com strongly indicates malicious intent."
