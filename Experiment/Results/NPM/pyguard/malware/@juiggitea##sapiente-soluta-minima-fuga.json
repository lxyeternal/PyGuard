      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares a large number of dependencies with suspicious and nonsensical package names, all scoped under unusual and likely fabricated namespaces such as '@firantea', '@juiggitea', '@npmteasources', and '@womhla6stea'. These package names do not correspond to known or reputable packages and appear to be autogenerated or obfuscated. The sheer volume and pattern of these dependencies strongly suggest a supply chain attack or an attempt to inject malicious code through these dependencies. Additionally, there are no scripts defined that would clarify the package's purpose, and the repository URL points to a user with the same suspicious namespace as the package name, which may be a front. Without inspecting the actual code of these dependencies, the presence of so many suspicious packages is a red flag for malicious behavior, such as malware, backdoors, or cryptomining scripts hidden in dependencies."
