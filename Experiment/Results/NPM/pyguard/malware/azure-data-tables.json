      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data into hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known for use in security testing and potentially malicious command-and-control or exfiltration. The code performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, which can be used for covert data exfiltration or beaconing. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with error handling suppressing any errors, and no legitimate user-facing functionality is present. The combination of host fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive environment and user data, DNS queries to a suspicious domain, and HTTP POST exfiltration to the same domain strongly indicates malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'azure-data-tables' with a very high version number '99.10.9' and a vague description 'azure whitehat package' without an author or proper license raises concerns about legitimacy. Without the actual 'index.js' code, the preinstall script's behavior cannot be verified, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
