      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the current directory, home directory, hostname, username, local IP address, public IP address, and DNS servers. It then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive user and system information without user consent or notification. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused by malware authors for stealthy data collection and command-and-control communication. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection or transmission. The code operates silently without error logging or user interaction, further indicating malicious reconnaissance and exfiltration activity."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, downloading malware, or compromising the system. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious."
