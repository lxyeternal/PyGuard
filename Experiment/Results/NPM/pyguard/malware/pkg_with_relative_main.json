It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication to an attacker-controlled server, which is a classic data exfiltration pattern. The conditional checks on hostname and paths appear designed to evade execution on certain environments, indicating stealth behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, environment reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration to a suspicious external endpoint. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
