      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the data collection. The use of DNS lookups with encoded host/path/user info and the subsequent HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain is a classic reconnaissance and data exfiltration pattern commonly seen in malware. The absence of error logging, user notification, or legitimate purpose, combined with the targeting of sensitive system directories and user information, strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation without any tests or clear purpose. The 'index.js' file could contain malicious code that runs on the user's machine during package installation. Additionally, the package name and description are generic and do not clearly indicate legitimate functionality, which is often a tactic used in malicious packages."
