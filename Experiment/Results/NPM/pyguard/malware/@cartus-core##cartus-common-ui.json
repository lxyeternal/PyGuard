It then constructs a DNS or HTTP request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain (npgrb1d2579b57p0s2dyr29ca3gu4usj.oastify.com) embedding this collected information. This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent. The use of exec to run shell commands that combine environment-derived data and network requests to an external, hardcoded suspicious domain is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or error handling that would justify this behavior. The comments referencing other similar suspicious domains reinforce the exfiltration purpose. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect and transmit sensitive host information to an attacker-controlled server, which is a hallmark of malware."
