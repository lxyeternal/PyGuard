      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares an unusually large number of dependencies with suspicious, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The package names use random Latin words and phrases, which is a common tactic to evade detection. The dependencies are all version ^1.0.0, suggesting they are newly published or fabricated. There are no scripts defined except a default test script, which is not suspicious by itself, but the sheer volume and naming pattern of dependencies strongly indicate this package is a dependency trojan or a malware dropper. Installing this package would likely pull in many unknown packages that could contain malicious code, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. Without further source code inspection, the dependency list alone is a strong red flag for malicious intent."
