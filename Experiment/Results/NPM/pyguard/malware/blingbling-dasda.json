It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (2wziq8c9bbquu915snokvtnyopugi66v.oastify.com) without any user consent or notification. The domain used is non-standard and appears to be an attacker-controlled endpoint commonly used for exfiltration or reconnaissance. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. This pattern of gathering detailed host and user environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with reconnaissance and data theft malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node demo1.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without user consent. Additionally, the package depends on 'blingbling-dasda', which is the same as the package name and is not a known or trusted package, raising further suspicion. Without inspecting 'demo1.js' or the 'blingbling-dasda' package source, this setup is potentially malicious."
