      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data into a hex-encoded string combined with network and path information, then performs DNS lookups on a constructed domain name derived from this data. Subsequently, it sends a POST request containing this detailed system fingerprinting data to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code includes multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. The behavior matches classic malware reconnaissance and data exfiltration patterns, including host fingerprinting and stealthy network communication to an attacker-controlled server. The absence of error logging, suppression of exceptions, and the use of hardcoded suspicious domains further confirm malicious intent. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
