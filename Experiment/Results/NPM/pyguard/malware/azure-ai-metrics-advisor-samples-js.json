      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication to an attacker-controlled server, which is a classic data exfiltration pattern. The conditional checks on hostname and paths appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments, indicating stealth behavior. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, and exfiltration to a suspicious external domain without consent or transparency is a strong indicator of malicious intent consistent with reconnaissance and data theft malware."
