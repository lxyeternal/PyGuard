It collects sensitive information from the local environment, including all environment variables, the system hostname, network interface addresses, and the package name. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external server (doc.nexthink.com) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This pattern matches several critical risk indicators for malware, including: (1) exfiltration of environment variables (which may contain credentials, tokens, or secrets), (2) host fingerprinting (hostname, network interfaces), and (3) automated, stealthy network communication during package installation or execution. The code does not perform any legitimate business logic and is solely focused on reconnaissance and data exfiltration, which are hallmarks of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. Even though the comment claims the server is controlled by a security team, the behavior itself is indistinguishable from malicious code and poses a severe security risk.",
