      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication conditionally based on hostname and path checks, which appear designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system details, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. The use of DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from system info further indicates covert data exfiltration techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this behavior, and the external domain is suspicious and unrelated to any known benign purpose. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with host fingerprinting and data exfiltration malware."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
