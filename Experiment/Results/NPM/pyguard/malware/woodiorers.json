Upon deobfuscation and analysis, the code listens for the DOMContentLoaded event, then attempts to locate a DOM element with the class 'woodiorers'. If found, it extracts the first class name from that element and constructs a URL using the pattern 'https://as.sethubz.site/fl/' + [className]. It then creates an iframe with this URL as the src and injects it into the DOM. The injected iframe is styled to be invisible (width: 100%, height: 100%, display: none, no border, no margin), making it stealthy and hidden from the user. The use of a hardcoded, non-standard, and suspicious domain (as.sethubz.site) is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it could be used for tracking, exfiltration, or further payload delivery. The code executes automatically on page load, without user interaction or consent, and the obfuscation further suggests an attempt to evade detection. These patterns match several high-risk and critical-risk indicators from the knowledge base, including obfuscated code, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, stealthy DOM injection, and lack of user notification or consent. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to exfiltrate data, track users, or load further malicious content from a remote server.",
