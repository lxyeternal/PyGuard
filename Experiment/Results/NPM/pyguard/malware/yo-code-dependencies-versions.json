It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain '2x0euw7x6u9r79jbbd1pltuttkzcn1.burpcollaborator.net', which is commonly used for testing exfiltration or command-and-control communication. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose evident for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging on the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host-specific information and exfiltrating it silently to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
