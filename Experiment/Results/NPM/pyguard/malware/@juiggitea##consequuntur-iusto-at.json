      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares an unusually large number of dependencies, all with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The naming pattern suggests these packages could be part of a malicious or obfuscated dependency chain. There are no scripts defined that would normally trigger suspicious behavior, but the sheer volume and naming of dependencies is a strong indicator of a potential supply chain attack or malware distribution via nested dependencies. Without further inspection of the actual package contents, this pattern is highly suspicious and typical of malicious packages designed to hide harmful code within many small dependencies."
