It attempts to gather sensitive system information by running various commands such as 'env', 'ps aux', and reading sensitive files like '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow'. It then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via HTTP POST requests to a remote server controlled by the attacker (a subdomain of 'burpcollaborator.net', a domain commonly used for testing and exploiting SSRF and other vulnerabilities). Additionally, it attempts to ping these remote domains, likely to confirm network connectivity or exfiltration. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and reconnaissance, which is malicious."
