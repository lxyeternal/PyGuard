      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains an unusually large number of dependencies with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The package and dependency names appear to be Latin phrases or gibberish, which is a common tactic used to evade detection. There is no meaningful description, author information, or tests, and the repository URL points to a user with a similar suspicious naming pattern. This pattern is typical of malicious or typosquatting packages designed to inject malicious code through transitive dependencies. Without inspecting the actual code of these dependencies, the presence of so many suspicious packages strongly indicates malicious intent or at least a high risk of malicious behavior."
