It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cjs6bjp5dlpnojrhhvp0g1enrynbjdb4g.oast.pro), which is a domain pattern commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing and often abused for data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently, indicating an intent to avoid detection. The combination of gathering detailed host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled endpoint without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
