      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names targeting a hardcoded suspicious domain (425a2.rt11.ml), performing DNS lookups on these constructed names. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and user information, and the domain used is not related to any legitimate service. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this behavior. The code suppresses error logging for network requests, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. These patterns—host fingerprinting, encoding of sensitive data, DNS queries to attacker-controlled domains, and HTTP POST exfiltration—are classic hallmarks of malware performing reconnaissance and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
