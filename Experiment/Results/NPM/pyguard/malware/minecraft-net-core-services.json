These commands send information about the user (via 'whoami'), current working directory (via 'pwd'), and hostname (via 'hostname') to an external URL (https://rc7zp9d1aana6foij7ul4tkdr4xvll9a.oastify.com). This behavior leaks potentially sensitive environment information to a third party without user consent, which is considered malicious."
