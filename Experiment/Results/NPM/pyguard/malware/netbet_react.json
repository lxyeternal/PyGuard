It then sends this collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://u7obzgeb.requestrepo.com) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The domain is not a known legitimate service and appears to be attacker-controlled. The code suppresses errors silently during the data exfiltration process, indicating an intent to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering detailed host fingerprinting information and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior commonly observed in malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality justifying this data collection and transmission. Therefore, this code is malicious."
