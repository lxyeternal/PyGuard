It listens for 'exec:cmd' events from the server, executes received shell commands on the local system using 'exec', and sends back the command output or errors. This effectively creates a remote code execution backdoor, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the infected machine. Additionally, the code attempts to clean the 'package.json' file by removing install scripts and dependencies, and deletes a 'bundle.js' file, likely to remove traces or disable legitimate functionality. The connection to an external server with no user interaction or notification, combined with arbitrary command execution and file manipulation, is a hallmark of malware or a remote access trojan (RAT). Therefore, this code is malicious."
