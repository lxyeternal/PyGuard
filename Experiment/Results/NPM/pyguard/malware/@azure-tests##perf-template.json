      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known to be used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware. It performs DNS lookups on these constructed queries, which is a covert channel for data exfiltration. Furthermore, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain without any user consent or notification. The data exfiltration is done silently, with no error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The domain used is not related to the package or any legitimate service, strongly suggesting malicious intent. The code structure, generic function names, and lack of legitimate business logic or user-facing features further support this conclusion. This pattern matches known malware behavior of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure."
