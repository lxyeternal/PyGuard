It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (7mul78l1dfqp4h5e8mx8qh7cu30uwip6e.oastify.com), which is not related to any legitimate service. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The data exfiltration of environment and user-specific information to an attacker-controlled server without legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate domain for data exfiltration combined with the collection of sensitive host and user information strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because it executes code before installation without any visible logs or warnings. The package also includes a common dependency 'lodash' which is not suspicious by itself, but the hidden execution in 'preinstall' could be used to run malicious code in 'index.js'. Without the content of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
