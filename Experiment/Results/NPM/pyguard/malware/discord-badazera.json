      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with malware patterns. It searches user-specific directories (LOCALAPPDATA) for Discord installations, then downloads a remote JavaScript payload from a hardcoded external URL (a GitHub raw URL hosting 'injection.js'). It overwrites core Discord module files with this payload, injecting a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration. The code forcibly kills running Discord processes and restarts them to ensure the injected code is loaded, indicating persistence and stealth. It also modifies BetterDiscord files to redirect webhook API calls, further indicating tampering. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for POSTing injection success notifications and the replacement of Discord core files without user consent are clear signs of unauthorized code injection and data exfiltration. The code lacks any legitimate user-facing functionality, uses environment variables to locate sensitive user directories, performs network requests to attacker-controlled endpoints, and executes shell commands to kill and restart processes. These behaviors align with credential stealing, persistence, and remote control malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
