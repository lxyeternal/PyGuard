It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ckpae992vtc0000wngb0gj5f8rhyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domain used is typical of out-of-band testing or attacker-controlled endpoints. This pattern of gathering detailed host environment data and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior, consistent with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This script executes the index.js file silently before installation, suppressing all output and errors. This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to run arbitrary or malicious code during installation without the user's knowledge. Additionally, the package depends on itself '@webview/react-skeletor' with version '^6.6.6', which is unusual and may indicate a dependency confusion or attempt to pull in a different version that could be malicious. The combination of a silent preinstall script and self-dependency is a red flag for potential malicious behavior."
