      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interface IP addresses, and package metadata without any user consent or notification. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS queries to a suspicious hardcoded domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in offensive security and malware contexts. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious domain. The data exfiltration is done silently without error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and user data, encoding it, performing DNS lookups to an attacker-controlled domain, and sending the data over HTTPS to that domain is a classic pattern of reconnaissance and data exfiltration used by malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code for such behavior, and the hardcoded external domain is not related to the package's stated purpose. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
