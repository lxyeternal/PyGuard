      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares an unusually large number of dependencies with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The package names and scopes appear nonsensical and are likely fabricated to evade detection. This pattern is typical of malicious packages designed to pull in many dependencies that could contain hidden malicious code, backdoors, or malware. Additionally, the repository URL and author fields are empty or generic, which is suspicious. The lack of meaningful scripts and the presence of many similarly named dependencies from multiple unknown scopes strongly suggests this package is part of a supply chain attack or malware distribution."
