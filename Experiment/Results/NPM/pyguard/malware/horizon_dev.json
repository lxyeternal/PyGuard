      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json file defines a 'preinstall' script: 'bash ./pre.sh'. This means that whenever the package is installed (including as a dependency), the shell script 'pre.sh' will be executed automatically. This is a high-risk pattern and a common vector for supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the user's system during installation, without user interaction or consent. The contents of 'pre.sh' are not provided, so its behavior cannot be directly assessed, but the mere presence of a preinstall hook that runs a shell script is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks. This pattern is rarely justified in benign packages and is a hallmark of malicious behavior, as it can be used to download and execute further payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system. Unless there is a clear, legitimate, and well-documented reason for this script (which is not present here), this package should be considered malicious or at least highly suspicious.",
