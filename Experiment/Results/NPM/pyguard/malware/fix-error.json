      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated using an eval with a complex decoding function and encoded string data. Such obfuscation is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. The code uses dynamic evaluation (eval) on decoded data, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it allows execution of arbitrary code that is hidden from static analysis. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution pattern matches known malware techniques for payload delivery, evasion, and unauthorized code execution. There is no clear legitimate functionality or user-facing purpose visible in the code. Given the extensive obfuscation, use of eval on decoded content, and lack of transparency, this code is highly suspicious and consistent with malicious JavaScript/NPM package behavior."
