It then sends this sensitive data via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (f5778d1d81cc30c39dcdd0da5ca1d49a.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including automated environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. The endpoint is suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate service, and the code lacks any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. The absence of error handling around the network call (other than logging errors) and the immediate transmission of sensitive system data strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance payloads."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares a dependency on itself ('eslint-plugin-pan'), which is unusual and can cause recursive or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js' before installation, which can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the source code of 'index.js', this is suspicious and a common vector for malicious behavior. The inclusion of 'corepack' and 'npm' as dependencies is also unusual for a plugin and may be an attempt to manipulate package management. Overall, these factors strongly suggest potential malicious intent."
