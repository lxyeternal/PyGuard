It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the data collection. The use of DNS lookups on encoded queries and an HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for transmitting detailed host fingerprinting and file system data is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The absence of error logging, user notification, or legitimate purpose, combined with the hardcoded suspicious domain and the nature of collected data, strongly indicates malicious intent."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Additionally, the package name 'azure-iot' and version '99.10.9' appear unusual and may be attempting to impersonate a legitimate package. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise suspicion."
