      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname, path, and username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns, as it profiles the host environment and sends sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an external, suspicious domain for sending encoded system data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with known malware reconnaissance and exfiltration techniques."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
