It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (eo1z2prk4as56mb.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party service often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, commonly abused for data exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose indicated for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging for the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of silently gathering sensitive environment and user information and exfiltrating it to an external, hardcoded, suspicious endpoint without consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware."
