It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cm30n6w2vtc0000cv6m0gkbo1ehyyyyyd.oast.fun), which is not related to any legitimate service and resembles domains used for testing or malicious exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and the code suppresses error logging for the network request, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The collection and exfiltration of sensitive host and user information without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. The use of a hardcoded external endpoint for data exfiltration, combined with the nature of the collected data and lack of legitimate purpose or documentation, strongly indicates malicious behavior."

This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, which is malicious as it leaks sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server."
