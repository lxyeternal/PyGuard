      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information including the package name, current directory, user home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, and package metadata. It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cmbtidbm27je8m3tmcd0ub6mm4jk7oxfn.oast.fun), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domain used is similar to those commonly employed for out-of-band interaction testing or malicious data exfiltration. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without user consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'scripts' section contains suspicious commands: the 'test' script executes a curl command to an external URL (https://ken.requestcatcher.com/), which could be used to exfiltrate data or perform unwanted network requests. More critically, the 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js' before installation, which can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', this is a significant red flag as it may perform malicious actions silently during install."
