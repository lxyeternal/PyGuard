      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json specifies a 'preinstall' script that runs './install.sh'. This is suspicious because it executes a shell script before installation, which can run arbitrary code on the user's system. Additionally, the 'main' field points to 'install.sh', which is unusual since 'main' typically points to a JavaScript entry file. The package also lists itself as a dependency ('emob-lp'), which is likely an error or an attempt to confuse dependency resolution. Without the content of 'install.sh', it is impossible to fully assess, but the presence of a preinstall shell script and self-dependency are strong indicators of potentially malicious behavior."
