It then sends this detailed system fingerprinting data via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external endpoint (fb40d252f3831c4553eb428e5620a2a0.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity: automated collection and exfiltration of sensitive system information, use of a hardcoded suspicious external URL, no legitimate user-facing purpose or documentation, and no error handling or logging to indicate transparency. The data exfiltration is done silently and immediately upon execution, which is a hallmark of malware performing reconnaissance and data theft. Therefore, this code is malicious as it performs unauthorized system information gathering and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server."
