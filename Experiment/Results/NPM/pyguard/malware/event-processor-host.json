      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently, uses multiple heuristics to avoid execution on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and exfiltration. The combination of host fingerprinting, directory enumeration, and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data theft malware. The code runs automatically on import or execution, performs network communication to suspicious endpoints, and sends sensitive environment and system data without user interaction. These behaviors align strongly with malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration patterns commonly seen in malware and supply chain attacks."
