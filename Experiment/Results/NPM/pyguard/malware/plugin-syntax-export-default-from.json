      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation of hostname, path, and user info, which appears designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The code suppresses errors silently and does not provide any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to an attacker-controlled domain for transmitting detailed host fingerprinting and file system data is a classic hallmark of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no benign justification for collecting and sending such sensitive environment and file system information to an unknown external server, especially with obfuscated hostname/path checks and no user notification. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware or a supply chain attack payload."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process without any tests or clear purpose. The 'index.js' file is not provided, so its contents are unknown, but running code at preinstall stage is a common vector for malicious behavior such as executing unwanted scripts, downloading malware, or compromising the system. Additionally, the package name and version are unusual and the description is vague ('azure package'), which can be a tactic to disguise malicious intent."
