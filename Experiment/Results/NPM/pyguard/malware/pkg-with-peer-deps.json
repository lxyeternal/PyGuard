      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses the Node.js child_process exec function to run a shell command that performs a curl request to a hardcoded external URL (http://canarytokens.com/tags/stuff/p67qa60q6zss6hjj2nlx6ovge/index.html). This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it involves executing a shell command to contact an external, hardcoded endpoint without any user interaction or legitimate purpose. The use of exec with a direct shell command to fetch data from an external URL is commonly associated with malware that attempts to perform network reconnaissance, exfiltrate data, or trigger external callbacks (such as canary tokens for detection). There is no error handling beyond logging, no user notification, and no legitimate business logic visible. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators, including arbitrary shell command execution, network communication to suspicious hardcoded endpoints, and lack of transparency or user consent. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
