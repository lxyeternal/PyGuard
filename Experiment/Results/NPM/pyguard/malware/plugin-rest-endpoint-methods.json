      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths without user consent. It encodes this data into a custom hex-based format combined with network and user environment details, then sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). The code performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed domain names derived from local system data, which is a known reconnaissance and exfiltration technique. The isValid function contains multiple conditions to exclude certain hostnames and paths, indicating evasion attempts to avoid detection on specific environments. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses errors silently and does not perform any benign application logic. These behaviors align with typical malicious patterns of host fingerprinting, environment reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure, consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
