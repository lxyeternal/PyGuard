      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths without user consent. It encodes this data into a custom hex-based format combined with network and user environment details, then sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). The code performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed domain names derived from local system data, which is a known reconnaissance and exfiltration technique. The data collection includes potentially sensitive file paths from system root and user directories, which is unusual for benign packages. The code suppresses errors silently, lacks user interaction or notification, and uses multiple heuristics to avoid execution on certain hostnames or paths, indicating evasion attempts. The overall behavior matches known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled infrastructure without legitimate purpose or user consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
