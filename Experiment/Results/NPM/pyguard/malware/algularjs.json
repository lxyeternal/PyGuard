It then serializes this information into JSON and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data theft. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused by malware authors for stealthy data collection. The code runs automatically upon import (immediately invoked async function), performing this data collection and exfiltration silently, with minimal error handling and no legitimate user-facing functionality. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, unauthorized data exfiltration, and use of hardcoded external endpoints for communication. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'algularjs' is a typo-squatting attempt on the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it is designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository and author information point to a user known for fuzzing or testing security, but the presence of a preinstall script running an external JS file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
