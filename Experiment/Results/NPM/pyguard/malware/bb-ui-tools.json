This pattern is highly suspicious because it dynamically executes code from an external file without any validation or sanitization. The use of eval on data read from a file can lead to arbitrary code execution, which is a common technique in malware for payload delivery or execution of hidden malicious logic. There is no error handling, no user interaction, and no indication that the executed code is safe or trusted. This dynamic execution of potentially untrusted code is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it can be used to run arbitrary commands, download further payloads, or perform unauthorized actions on the system."
