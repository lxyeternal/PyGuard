      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata without any user consent or notification. It encodes this data into hex and constructs DNS query names that are sent to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in offensive security and malware contexts. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. The data exfiltration occurs silently without error logging or user interaction, indicating stealth. The combination of gathering sensitive environment and user data, encoding it, performing DNS lookups to attacker-controlled domains, and posting the data to an external server is a classic pattern of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code for this behavior, and the domain used is not related to the package or any known benign service. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
