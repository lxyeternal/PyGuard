It then encodes this collected information in hexadecimal and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a Telegram bot API endpoint using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of system and environment details to an external, attacker-controlled server without user consent or notification. The use of exec to run a complex shell command that performs reconnaissance and network communication, combined with hardcoded credentials and no legitimate user-facing purpose, is a strong indicator of malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware. The code lacks error handling for the network operation beyond logging, does not provide any benign functionality, and directly transmits sensitive host information to an external endpoint, fulfilling multiple critical risk indicators for malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1' which executes a JavaScript file named 'index.js' before installation, suppressing all output. This is suspicious because it runs arbitrary code silently during package installation, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this cannot be definitively classified as safe. The rest of the package.json appears normal, but the hidden execution in 'preinstall' is a red flag."
