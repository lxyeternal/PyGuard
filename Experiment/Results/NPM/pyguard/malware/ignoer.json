      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link) and saves it locally as 'README.txt.lnk' in the current directory. Immediately after the download finishes, it executes this downloaded file using the child_process.exec function. This pattern of fetching an executable or script from an external source and running it without user interaction or validation is a classic hallmark of malware. The code lacks any error handling or user notification, and the downloaded file has a suspicious extension (.lnk) which is typically a Windows shortcut but can be abused to execute arbitrary commands or payloads. The direct coupling of network retrieval with shell execution, especially from an untrusted external source, is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code snippet, and it matches multiple known malicious patterns such as remote payload retrieval and immediate execution, which are commonly used in malware propagation and payload delivery."
