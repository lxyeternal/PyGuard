It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml), which is suspicious and indicative of data exfiltration. The code suppresses errors silently, avoids user interaction or notification, and performs network communication to an untrusted external server. The use of hostname and path checks to selectively avoid execution on certain environments suggests evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. These behaviors align with typical malicious patterns of reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration, making this code malicious."
