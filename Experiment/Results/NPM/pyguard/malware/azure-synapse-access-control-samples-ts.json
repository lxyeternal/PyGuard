      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings and HTTP POST data. It then sends this information silently to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code suppresses errors and performs network communication stealthily, indicating an intent to exfiltrate sensitive environment and system data. The use of hostname and path checks to selectively avoid certain environments suggests evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns of reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware, especially supply chain or post-installation backdoor code. Therefore, this code is malicious."
