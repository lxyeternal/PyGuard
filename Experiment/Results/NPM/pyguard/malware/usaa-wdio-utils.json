      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script: 'sh install.sh'. This means that, upon installation of the package (including as a dependency), the install.sh shell script will be executed automatically on the user's system. This is a high-risk pattern and a common vector for supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution during installation without user interaction or consent. The contents of install.sh are not shown, so it is impossible to determine its intent from this file alone, but the mere presence of a preinstall shell script is a strong indicator of potentially malicious or at least highly suspicious behavior. This is especially true when there is no clear, legitimate reason for such a script in a utility package, and no documentation or user notification is provided. Additionally, the use of non-standard fields like '1prepare' and '1engines' is unusual and may be an attempt to evade automated analysis or to interfere with package manager behavior, which is also suspicious. The rest of the dependencies and scripts do not appear overtly malicious, but the preinstall script is sufficient to classify this as potentially malicious.",
