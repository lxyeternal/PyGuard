It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (ckskkke2vtc0000ktmhggjh333wyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is not related to the package's legitimate functionality. There is no user interaction, notification, or consent, and error handling suppresses any network errors, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The domain used is typical of out-of-band testing or attacker-controlled endpoints. This pattern of collecting host-specific information and exfiltrating it silently to an external server is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. The absence of any legitimate business logic or user-facing features, combined with the direct network exfiltration of sensitive environment and user data, classifies this code as malicious."
