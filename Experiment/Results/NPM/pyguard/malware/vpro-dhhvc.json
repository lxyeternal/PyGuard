It then base64 encodes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (lulshdazpypdagyixvqzasm9jt0fgtv0n.oast.fun) without any user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration and system reconnaissance, which is strongly associated with malware. The use of child_process.exec to run shell commands, the collection of user and system identity information, writing to a temporary file, encoding the data, and sending it to an attacker-controlled external endpoint are all critical risk indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in this code, and it lacks error handling or user interaction for the data collection and transmission steps, further confirming its malicious nature."
