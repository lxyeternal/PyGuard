It then serializes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user information to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint without any user consent or notification is a classic hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration is suspicious and commonly abused by malware authors for stealthy data collection. The code runs automatically upon import or execution without any user interaction or legitimate purpose, further indicating malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the data collected is sensitive and privacy-invasive. These factors combined align strongly with known malware patterns of host fingerprinting and unauthorized data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'angplarjs' is a typo-squatting variant of 'angularjs', and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. Without the content of 'new.js', the exact behavior is unknown, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious activity."
