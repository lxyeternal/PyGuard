      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST data sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without any user interaction or notification. The code performs multiple DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from local system data, which is a known technique for covert data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The isValid function attempts to exclude certain hostnames and paths, likely to evade detection or avoid running in analysis environments, indicating stealth behavior. The network communication is done silently with suppressed error handling and no logging, further indicating an intent to avoid detection. The data exfiltration includes sensitive environment and system information, which is a hallmark of reconnaissance and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection and transmission. The hardcoded suspicious external domain and the pattern of collecting and exfiltrating host-specific data without consent strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with malware behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
