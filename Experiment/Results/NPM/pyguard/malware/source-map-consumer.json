It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query names and HTTP POST payloads sent to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) over HTTPS without user consent or notification. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication immediately upon module execution, indicating automated data exfiltration. The use of hostname and path checks to selectively avoid execution on certain environments suggests evasion techniques. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, environment reconnaissance, and covert exfiltration of sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation without clear necessity or transparency. Additionally, the package name 'source-map-consumer' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to the official source-map-consumer package, and the description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated. These factors suggest potential malicious intent to execute hidden code during installation."
