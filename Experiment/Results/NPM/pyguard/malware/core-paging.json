It then encodes this data into a custom string format and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently and performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated hostnames derived from local system data, which is a common reconnaissance and exfiltration technique. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests evasion attempts to avoid detection in specific environments. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the purpose of this data collection and transmission. The behavior matches known malicious patterns of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, which is a hallmark of malware or supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package has an unusually high version number (99.10.9) and minimal metadata, which can be indicators of a potentially malicious or spoofed package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
