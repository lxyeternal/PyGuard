      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex validation of hostname, path, username, and directory contents, which appears designed to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware patterns, as it profiles the host environment and sends sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The use of hardcoded suspicious domain, silent error handling, and exfiltration of sensitive system and user data without consent are strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Since the content of 'index.js' is not provided, it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
