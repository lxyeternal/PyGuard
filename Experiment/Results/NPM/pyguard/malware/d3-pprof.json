      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system and environment information, including the parent package's package.json content, platform, architecture, Node.js version, package name and version, hostname, and uptime. It then sends this collected telemetry data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/a0f63062-f716-4f8b-b48c-691cd64b3bdc) without any user consent, notification, or legitimate business logic. The use of a hardcoded webhook.site URL, which is commonly used for testing or as a placeholder but can also be abused for data exfiltration, combined with the exfiltration of potentially sensitive package and system information, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no error handling or user interaction to justify this data collection and transmission. This pattern matches known malicious behaviors involving host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints, which is a hallmark of malware or supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code is malicious."
