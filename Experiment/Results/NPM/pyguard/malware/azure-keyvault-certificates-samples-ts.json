      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and constructs DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded external domain (425a2.rt11.ml) without any user interaction or consent. The data exfiltration is conditional on a complex hostname/path/username validation that appears designed to evade detection on certain known or analysis environments. The code suppresses errors silently and performs network communication stealthily. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining the need for such data collection or transmission. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including host fingerprinting, environment reconnaissance, and covert data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. The use of DNS lookups and HTTPS POST to a suspicious domain for sending encoded system data strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious."
