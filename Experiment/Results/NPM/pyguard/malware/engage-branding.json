It collects sensitive information from the local environment, including all environment variables (which may contain credentials, tokens, and secrets), the system hostname, network interface addresses, and the package name. It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external server (doc.nexthink.com) without any user interaction, notification, or consent. This pattern matches several high-confidence malware indicators: (1) automated collection and exfiltration of environment variables and host/network information, (2) execution without user interaction or legitimate purpose, (3) use of a hardcoded external endpoint, and (4) operation during package installation or as a side effect of import. Even though the comment claims the server is controlled by a security team, the behavior is indistinguishable from credential-stealing malware and constitutes a severe supply chain risk. Such actions are never justified in benign software and are a hallmark of information-stealing malware.",
