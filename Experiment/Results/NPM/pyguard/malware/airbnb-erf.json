It serializes this data into JSON and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cjs6bjp5dlpnojrhhvp0w8guxop3x1p58.oast.pro), which is a non-standard domain often used for testing or malicious exfiltration. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate purpose documented for this data collection and transmission. The code suppresses error logging on network failures, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of gathering host-specific information and exfiltrating it to an attacker-controlled server without consent is a hallmark of malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
