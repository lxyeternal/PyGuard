      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information such as the hostname, home directory, and current directory, then serializes this data into JSON. It encodes the data as hex and exfiltrates it by sending multiple DNS queries to a suspicious external domain ('dns.thewhybee.com'). This form of data exfiltration via DNS requests is a known covert channel often used by malware to bypass network monitoring. The code suppresses errors silently, does not notify the user, and performs network communication without any legitimate user interaction or clear business purpose. The use of randomized IDs in DNS queries and chunking of data further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the code terminates early if the hostname matches a specific value, which may be an evasion technique. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns of host reconnaissance and covert data exfiltration, indicating that the code is malicious."
