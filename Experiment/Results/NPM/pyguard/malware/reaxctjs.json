It then serializes this information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by a third party. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive host information without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for data transmission is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as Discord webhooks are commonly abused for covert data exfiltration. The code runs automatically upon import (immediately invoked async function), with no user interaction or legitimate purpose evident. There is minimal error handling and no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. Collecting and exfiltrating system and user environment data to an external, hardcoded endpoint without consent is a hallmark of malware, specifically information-stealing or reconnaissance malware preparing for further exploitation or targeted attacks."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'reaxctjs' is a misspelling of 'reactjs', and the repository URL 'AngulerJS' is a misspelling of 'AngularJS', which are common tactics used in dependency confusion or typosquatting attacks. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further suggests this package is designed to exploit such attacks."
