It includes a large encoded string that is decoded and then executed dynamically, which is a classic hallmark of malicious code designed to evade static analysis. The code imports modules dynamically using obfuscated keys and performs operations on environment variables and process arguments, indicating it collects system information. It reads files and appears to exfiltrate or process their contents without any user interaction or notification. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, environment inspection, and file reading combined strongly indicate malicious intent, consistent with known malware behaviors such as data exfiltration, persistence, or remote code execution. There is no legitimate or benign purpose evident in the code, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, dynamic eval, environment reconnaissance, and potential network communication."
