      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains a hex-encoded payload that is decoded and then executed via eval, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and malicious intent. The decoded payload (from the hex string) performs the following suspicious actions: it requires 'os', 'dns', and 'https' modules, defines a function to get public IP addresses by making an HTTPS GET request to an external API (https://api.ipify.org), collects system information (hostname and working directory), and then sends this information to the external API. It also performs DNS resolution on a suspicious domain (u391r9bzg4917yssqcil2anler7v03p.oastify.com), which is a known service used for detecting exfiltration or C2 communication. The code uses asynchronous event handlers to collect data chunks and parse JSON responses, then calls process.exit(1) to terminate the process immediately after exfiltration, indicating no legitimate user interaction or notification. The combination of obfuscation (hex encoding), dynamic code execution (eval), network communication to suspicious external endpoints, system information collection, and immediate process termination without error handling or logging strongly matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including remote data retrieval, exfiltration, and stealthy execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
