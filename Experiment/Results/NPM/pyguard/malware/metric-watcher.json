      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, and package metadata without any user interaction or consent. It encodes this data in hex and constructs DNS query strings targeting a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (interactsh.com), which is known to be used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in malware and penetration testing. The code performs multiple DNS lookups to these constructed queries, effectively leaking system fingerprinting data. Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same suspicious external domain. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation explaining this data collection and transmission. The absence of error logging and user notification, combined with the exfiltration of sensitive environment and network information to a hardcoded, attacker-controlled domain, strongly indicates malicious reconnaissance and data exfiltration behavior consistent with malware or supply chain attack payloads."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially malicious as it could run harmful code without the user's explicit consent."
