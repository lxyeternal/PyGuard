      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json specifies a dependency on the package 'user' with version '^0.0.0'. The 'user' package is a known typosquat and is not a legitimate or widely used npm package. Malicious actors often publish packages with generic or common names like 'user' to trick developers into installing them, and such packages have been observed to contain malware, credential stealers, or code that exfiltrates sensitive information. The rest of the package.json does not contain suspicious scripts, but the presence of this dependency is a strong indicator of supply chain attack risk. Installing this package could result in the execution of malicious code during installation or runtime, depending on the contents of the 'user' package. This matches known supply chain attack patterns and is considered highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
