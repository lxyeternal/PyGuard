      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a highly suspicious and likely malicious dependency: 'user': '*'. There is no legitimate, well-known npm package named 'user', and this is a common indicator of a typosquatted or malicious package. Attackers often publish packages with generic names like 'user' to trick developers or to execute malicious code during installation or runtime. The rest of the package.json appears standard for a React Native library, but the inclusion of 'user' as a dependency is a strong indicator of supply chain attack risk. This package could execute arbitrary code on install or at runtime, depending on the contents of the 'user' package, which is a classic vector for malware in the npm ecosystem.",
