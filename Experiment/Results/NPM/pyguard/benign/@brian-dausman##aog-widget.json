      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json file specifies a dependency on itself: '@brian-dausman/aog-widget': '^1.0.6'. This is a highly suspicious and potentially malicious pattern. Self-referential dependencies can create infinite install loops, which can be abused for denial-of-service attacks or to obfuscate the true dependency tree, making it easier to hide malicious payloads. This pattern is not observed in legitimate packages and is a known indicator of supply chain attacks. Additionally, if the referenced version (1.0.6) contains malicious install scripts or payloads, this package will inherit and execute them, potentially compromising the system. This behavior matches known supply chain attack vectors in the npm ecosystem.",
