      "malicious_behavior": "This package.json is highly suspicious and likely malicious for several reasons: (1) All npm scripts (build, test, lint) execute a file named '../../fake-build.js', which is outside the project directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, as it executes code from a parent directory, potentially outside the control or visibility of the project. (2) The script name 'fake-build.js' is non-standard and suspicious, suggesting an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate build process while actually running arbitrary code. (3) The dependencies listed (e.g., 'helper-lib-2_01', 'lib-1_05', etc.) do not correspond to any known or reputable npm packages and may be typosquatted or fake packages, which is a common malware distribution technique. (4) There is no legitimate reason for build/test/lint scripts to all point to the same, non-standard JS file outside the project. (5) If a user or CI system runs any npm script, it will execute potentially malicious code from outside the project tree, which could exfiltrate data, install backdoors, or perform other harmful actions. This matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns from the knowledge base, including execution of arbitrary code during build/test, use of suspicious file paths, and possible supply chain attack vectors.",

The build, test, and lint scripts all execute a file named '../../fake-build.js', which is outside the current project directory. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where scripts in package.json are used to execute arbitrary code during common developer workflows (build, test, lint). The use of a non-standard, generically named script ('fake-build.js') located two directories up is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it could execute code not visible in the current project, potentially exfiltrate data, or perform other harmful actions. None of the dependencies are standard or well-known, and their names (e.g., 'lib-1_08', 'helper-lib-2_05') are generic and could be typosquats or placeholders for further malicious code.
