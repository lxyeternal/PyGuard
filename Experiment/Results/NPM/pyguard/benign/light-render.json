      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json itself does not contain direct malicious scripts or install hooks, but it declares a dependency on 'the-only-one-pack-to-draw-light' (version ^1.0.5). This is a highly suspicious and non-standard package name, which is not a well-known or reputable library in the JavaScript ecosystem. Typosquatting and dependency confusion attacks often use such obscure or generic names to trick users into installing malicious code. The rest of the package.json appears normal, but the presence of this dependency is a strong indicator of potential supply chain risk. If 'the-only-one-pack-to-draw-light' is malicious, it could execute arbitrary code during installation or runtime, exfiltrate data, or perform other harmful actions without user consent. This pattern matches known supply chain attack vectors in the npm ecosystem, where a benign-looking package.json is used to pull in a malicious dependency. Therefore, this package.json should be considered malicious due to the high risk associated with the suspicious dependency.",
