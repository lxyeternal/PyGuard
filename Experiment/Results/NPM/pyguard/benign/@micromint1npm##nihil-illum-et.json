      "malicious_behavior": "This package.json exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior and supply chain attack patterns. The package depends on a large number of suspiciously named, non-standard, and likely typosquatted packages (e.g., '@micromint1npm/...' and '@rtyuigh6npm/...'), which are not recognized as legitimate open source libraries. The naming pattern is highly unusual and is a hallmark of malicious dependency confusion or supply chain attacks. Additionally, dependencies such as 'callingmyname2', 'mol-web3-crypto-1', 'mol-web3-crypto-2', and 'tul-crypto-fuc-3' are not standard and have been associated with malicious activity in the npm ecosystem, often used to deliver payloads, steal credentials, or exfiltrate data. The package itself has no meaningful description, no scripts (which can be a tactic to avoid detection), and the repository/author information is generic or fabricated. The excessive and suspicious dependencies, especially those with cryptography and web3-related names, are commonly used in malware to obfuscate intent, steal cryptocurrency, or execute arbitrary code. This package is highly likely to be part of a supply chain attack, and installing it could result in the execution of malicious code from one or more of its dependencies.",
