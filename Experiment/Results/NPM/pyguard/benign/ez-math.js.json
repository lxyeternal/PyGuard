      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares a dependency on 'pizza-clients', which is a highly suspicious and likely typosquatted package name. This is a known pattern in supply chain attacks, where a benign-looking package (here, 'ez-math.js') depends on a malicious or compromised package. The rest of the package.json appears normal, with no suspicious scripts or install hooks, but the presence of 'pizza-clients' as a dependency is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such packages often contain obfuscated or hidden payloads that execute upon installation or import, potentially exfiltrating data, running arbitrary code, or compromising the system. The author field is also a generic email, which is another red flag. In summary, the suspicious dependency is the primary indicator of malicious behavior.",
