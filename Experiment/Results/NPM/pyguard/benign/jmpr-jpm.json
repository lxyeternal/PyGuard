This is a highly suspicious and likely typosquatted or placeholder package name, which is not a standard or well-known library in the npm ecosystem. Packages with such names are often used in supply chain attacks to deliver malicious payloads. While the package.json itself does not contain install scripts or direct malicious code, the inclusion of a suspicious dependency is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior, as installing this package could execute arbitrary or harmful code from the 'ghjk' package. This pattern matches known supply chain attack vectors where a benign-looking package.json is used to pull in a malicious dependency.",
