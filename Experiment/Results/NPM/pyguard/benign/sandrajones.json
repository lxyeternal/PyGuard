      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json lists a large number of highly suspicious dependencies with non-standard, typosquatted, or person-name-like names (e.g., 'ls-arrayv1', 'tai-array-generator', 'limonovp1', 'vo21-module', 'JohnYoung-js', 'carolscott', 'susanmartin', 'rodrygarci-new', 'obs-lisacollins', 'sharondavis'). These are not well-known or reputable packages in the npm ecosystem and are commonly observed in malicious supply chain attacks, where attackers publish packages with innocuous or person-like names to trick users into installing them. Such packages often contain obfuscated or hidden malicious payloads that can exfiltrate data, execute arbitrary code, or download further malware. The presence of so many suspicious dependencies, especially in a package that claims to be a simple electrical circuit calculator, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. While the scripts section itself does not execute code during install, the risk is that these dependencies will execute malicious code upon installation or require. This pattern matches known supply chain attack behaviors in the npm ecosystem.",
