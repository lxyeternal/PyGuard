      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "This package.json is highly suspicious and likely malicious based on several key indicators: (1) The package and all its dependencies are from non-standard, non-official, and likely auto-generated or typosquatted namespaces (e.g., '@hoangcung1804npm', '@omegion1npm'), which is a common pattern in supply chain attacks. (2) There is an unusually large number of dependencies, all with similar naming patterns, suggesting a dependency confusion or dependency chain attack. (3) Many of these dependencies do not correspond to any known, reputable open-source libraries and are not found in the official npm registry, which is a hallmark of malicious packages designed to execute code during install or runtime. (4) The package itself has no meaningful description, no scripts, and no legitimate documentation, which is typical of packages created solely to deliver a payload. (5) The presence of other suspicious packages (e.g., 'tul-crypto-fuc-3', 'vnhat-modal-component', 'hai-custom-button', 'skyler-first-code') further increases the risk, as these are not recognized libraries and may themselves be malicious. (6) The repository and author information are generic and do not correspond to any known, reputable developer or organization. (7) The use of a large, generic, and unrelated keyword list is a common tactic to evade detection and increase the package's visibility in search results. (8) This pattern matches known supply chain attack techniques, where a benign-looking package pulls in a large number of malicious dependencies, one or more of which may execute code during installation or runtime, exfiltrate data, or download further payloads. (9) Even though there are no install scripts in this package.json, the risk is in the dependencies, which may contain preinstall/postinstall scripts or malicious code in their entry points. (10) The overall structure and naming conventions are consistent with previously documented npm malware campaigns. For these reasons, this package.json and its dependency chain should be considered highly malicious and should not be installed or trusted.",
