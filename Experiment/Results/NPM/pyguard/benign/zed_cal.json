This self-referential dependency can create an infinite install loop or be used as a vector for supply chain attacks, as seen in known malicious NPM packages. This pattern is not found in legitimate packages and is a strong indicator of malicious intent or a supply chain attack. Additionally, the package name and author are generic and the description is minimal, which are also common characteristics of malicious or typosquatted packages. While the package.json itself does not contain install scripts or direct code execution, the self-referential dependency is a critical red flag and should be treated as malicious.",
