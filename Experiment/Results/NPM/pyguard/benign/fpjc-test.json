      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a highly suspicious and likely malicious dependency loop: it declares itself ('fpjc-test') as a dependency with the same version ('0.0.1'). This is a known supply chain attack pattern, where a package depends on itself, potentially causing infinite install loops or enabling arbitrary code execution during installation if the registry is compromised or if a malicious version is published. This pattern is never seen in benign packages and is a hallmark of malware or supply chain attacks. Additionally, while the scripts section does not contain obviously malicious commands, the presence of this self-referential dependency is a critical red flag and is strongly associated with malicious intent or a compromised package.",
