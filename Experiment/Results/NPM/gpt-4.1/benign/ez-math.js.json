This could be a malicious or typosquatting package designed to execute harmful code when installed or used. The author email 'pizzaoventacos@gmail.com' also seems unrelated to the package purpose, which raises further suspicion. Without the source code of 'pizza-clients', it is not possible to fully verify, but the presence of this suspicious dependency strongly suggests potential malicious behavior."
