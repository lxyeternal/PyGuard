This self-dependency is highly suspicious and can lead to recursive dependency resolution or unexpected behavior during installation. Such a pattern is uncommon and may be used to obfuscate malicious code or cause supply chain issues. No other direct malicious scripts or dependencies are present, but the self-referential dependency is a red flag."
