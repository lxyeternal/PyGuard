      "malicious_behavior": "The dependency 'the-only-one-pack-to-draw-light' is highly suspicious due to its unusual and overly confident name, which is a common tactic used by malicious packages to appear unique or essential. Additionally, the author email 'anti2moron@gmail.com' and the GitHub URL 'AntiMoron' suggest a non-professional or potentially deceptive origin. Since the package.json itself contains no scripts or direct malicious code, the main risk lies in the suspicious dependency which could contain malicious code or backdoors. Without further inspection of that dependency's code, it is unsafe to trust this package."
