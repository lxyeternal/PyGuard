      "malicious_behavior": "The preinstall script executes a series of suspicious commands that collect sensitive system information and send it to an external server controlled by the attacker. Specifically, it constructs a hostname based on the local machine's hostname and user, then attempts to ping and send data to a subdomain of 'burpcollaborator.net', a domain commonly used for security testing and exploitation. The script collects environment variables, process lists, system version info, network configuration, and critical files such as /etc/hosts, /etc/passwd, and /etc/shadow, encodes this data in base64, and sends it via curl POST requests to the attacker's server. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and is malicious."
