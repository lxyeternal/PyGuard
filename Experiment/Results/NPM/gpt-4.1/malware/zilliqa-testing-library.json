It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggnsdwfyyyyyyn.interactsh.com). The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and sometimes by malware for data exfiltration, indicates that this code is exfiltrating sensitive environment and user data without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or backdoor functionality, making the code malicious."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
