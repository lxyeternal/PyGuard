      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, IP address, OS platform, user info, and current working directory, then encrypts this data and sends it encoded in a request to an external URL (https://kotko.org). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, which is a common malicious activity. Additionally, the code writes a file 'ByKotko.txt' with a seemingly unrelated message, possibly to mark execution or for persistence. The external request with encoded encrypted system data to a third-party domain without user consent is a strong sign of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json runs 'node index.js' during both 'preinstall' and 'postinstall' scripts, which is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation. Additionally, the 'preinstall' script runs 'npm i request --save-dev', which modifies dependencies during install, an unusual and potentially harmful behavior. The 'Dependencies' field is incorrectly capitalized (should be 'dependencies'), which may cause npm to ignore it, possibly hiding the actual dependencies. The presence of 'crypto', 'ip', 'os', and 'request' packages is not inherently malicious, but combined with the install scripts executing code, this suggests potential for malicious activity or unwanted side effects during installation."
