It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without user consent. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-proposal-private-methods' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to any known legitimate package, and the description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated. The combination of an unusual preinstall script and misleading metadata suggests potential malicious intent."
