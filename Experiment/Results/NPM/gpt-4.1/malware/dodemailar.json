      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'dodemailar' and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggest it might be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository URL points to a suspicious or unrelated project ('AngulerJS' instead of 'AngularJS'), which may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package. Without the content of 'new.js', the exact behavior cannot be confirmed, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious activity."
