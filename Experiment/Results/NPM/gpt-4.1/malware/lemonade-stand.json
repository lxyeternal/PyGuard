It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing or potentially for data exfiltration. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) which could be used for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration typically seen in malicious or spyware code."
