It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to an external server (356sv2lpkjygtxa2jimze3fvrmxdl59u.oastify.com), which is a suspicious domain often used for out-of-band interaction testing (similar to Burp Collaborator). This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious."

This behavior is suspicious because it executes an external network request during package installation, which can be used to download or execute malicious code or exfiltrate data. Such scripts are commonly used in malicious packages to compromise the user's environment."
