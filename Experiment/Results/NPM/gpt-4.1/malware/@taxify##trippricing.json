It then encodes this information in hexadecimal and sends it as a message to a Telegram chat using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is malicious."

This is suspicious because it suppresses all output and runs code during the install phase, which is a common technique used by malicious packages to execute hidden or harmful code. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially malicious."
