It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection in security testing but can also be abused for data exfiltration. The code also attempts to enumerate files from certain drives (commented out) which indicates potential for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and reconnaissance typical of malicious or spyware code."
