This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration via DNS queries, a common covert channel used by malware to leak sensitive information such as environment variables. The obfuscation of strings and the use of DNS resolution to send potentially sensitive data to an external domain (constructed as 'volgactf.fromip.{timestamp}.{index}.{chunk}') strongly suggests malicious intent."

This means it executes arbitrary JavaScript files (dns.js and index.js) which are not standard or expected scripts. Without seeing the content of these files, this behavior is suspicious because it can execute any code during package installation, potentially leading to malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or unauthorized network requests."
