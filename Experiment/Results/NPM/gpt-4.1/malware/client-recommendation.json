It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and unauthorized telemetry, which is considered malicious as it compromises user privacy and security."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Since the 'index.js' file is not provided, its contents are unknown, but running code at preinstall is a common vector for malicious behavior."
