      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains scripts (test, preinstall, install) that execute shell commands using nslookup and wget to contact an external domain (b0yz9rcc0lsa9bntp0r507rv6txzonho5d.burp.gdsburp.com). These commands leak the username and hostname of the machine by embedding them in the DNS query, which is a common technique for data exfiltration or reconnaissance. Additionally, the wget command downloads data from the same suspicious domain, which could lead to execution of malicious payloads or further compromise. The dependency on itself with a very high version number is unusual and may be an attempt to confuse or evade detection. Overall, these behaviors indicate malicious intent."
