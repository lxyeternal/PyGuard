      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com). The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration mechanism. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) and encodes path chunks, indicating an intent to gather environment details. This behavior is consistent with malicious telemetry or spyware designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive environment and system data without user consent."
