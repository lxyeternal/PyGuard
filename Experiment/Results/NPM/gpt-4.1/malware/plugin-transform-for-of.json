It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data. The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The obfuscation via hex encoding and conditional checks to avoid certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or analysis. This behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-for-of' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to known legitimate packages, and the description 'azure package' is vague. The 'index.js' file executed in preinstall could contain malicious code, which is a common tactic for malware in npm packages."
