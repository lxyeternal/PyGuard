It then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a remote IP address (185.62.58.88) on port 8000. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, which is commonly associated with malicious activity such as reconnaissance or unauthorized data collection. The conditional check on the hostname appears to be an evasion technique to avoid running on certain environments, which further suggests malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation without visible output can be used to execute malicious payloads or perform unwanted actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the use of a silent preinstall script is a common tactic in malicious packages."
