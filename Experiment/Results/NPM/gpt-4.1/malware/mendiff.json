Decoding the buffer reveals a command that echoes a base64-encoded string, decodes it, decompresses it with gunzip, and pipes it to /bin/bash, then removes itself. This behavior indicates that the code downloads or contains a compressed payload that is executed directly on the system shell, which is a common pattern for malicious code to execute hidden or unauthorized commands. The use of base64 encoding, compression, and immediate execution without user consent or transparency is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
