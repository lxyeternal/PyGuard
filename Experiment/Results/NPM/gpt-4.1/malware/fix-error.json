Such obfuscation is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. The code uses escape sequences and a complex replacement mechanism to reconstruct and execute code dynamically at runtime. This behavior is suspicious because it prevents easy static analysis and is often used to execute hidden or harmful payloads, such as stealing data, injecting malware, or performing unauthorized actions. Without fully decoding the entire payload (which is very large and obfuscated), the use of eval with obfuscated code alone is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
