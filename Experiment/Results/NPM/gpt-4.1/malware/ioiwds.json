It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (a Burp Collaborator domain, which is typically used for out-of-band interaction testing). This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious. The presence of a placeholder comment suggesting replacement with Interactsh or Pipedream domains further indicates the intent to send data to external monitoring or attacker-controlled endpoints."
