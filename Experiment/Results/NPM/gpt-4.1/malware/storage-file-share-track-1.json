      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces and IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is likely controlled by an attacker. The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration or telemetry backdoor. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) indicating potential for further data collection. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious spyware or backdoor functionality designed to stealthily gather and exfiltrate sensitive system information without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
