This means it runs in the background without any direct output or control from the parent process. Such behavior is suspicious because it can be used to run hidden background services or malware without the user's knowledge. The rest of the code appears to be a string formatting function, but the presence of the detached background process launch indicates potentially malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and suspicious behavior. It first checks if the parent process ID matches a command line argument, then reads the package name from package.json. It defines a function 'hxilify' that decodes a large hex-encoded string into ASCII and replaces a placeholder with the package name. The hex string decodes to JavaScript code that imports OS, DNS, querystring, https, fs, and path modules, defines multiple functions for hex and unicode checks, validates hostnames against hardcoded hex strings, enumerates files in the current directory, and makes a POST HTTPS request to a suspicious hostname 'eome8ew0yti04in.m.pipedream.net' on port 443 with collected data. The code then evaluates this decoded script after a long delay (100 minutes). This behavior indicates the code is designed to collect environment information and send it to a remote server covertly, which is typical of malicious backdoor or data exfiltration malware."
