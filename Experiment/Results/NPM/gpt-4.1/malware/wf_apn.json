      "malicious_behavior": "The code spawns a detached child process running 'node svc.js' with the current process ID as an argument, and detaches it from the parent process with stdio ignored. This means the child process runs in the background independently and silently, which is a common technique used by malware or backdoors to persist or perform hidden actions without user awareness. Additionally, the main code exports a function to load templates asynchronously but immediately launches this detached process on load, which is suspicious behavior. Without the content of 'svc.js', the exact malicious intent cannot be fully determined, but spawning a detached, unmonitored background process is a strong indicator of potentially malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and suspicious behavior indicative of malicious intent. It checks if a command line argument equals the parent process ID, then reads the package name from package.json and uses it to replace a placeholder in a large hex-encoded string. This string decodes to multiple utility functions including hex-to-ascii conversion, input validation, and network interface inspection. The decoded code constructs a URL with a suspicious hostname ('3faa13bc25347fa55cff.d.requestbin.net'), appends various system and user information (hostname, user info, network interfaces), and sends this data to the remote server. The use of setTimeout to delay execution by over an hour (1000 * 67 * 60 ms) suggests an attempt to evade immediate detection. The overall behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and remote tracking, which is malicious."
