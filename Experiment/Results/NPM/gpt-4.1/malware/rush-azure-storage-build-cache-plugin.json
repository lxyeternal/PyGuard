It encodes this data and sends it via HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which can be used for covert data exfiltration or command and control communication. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."
