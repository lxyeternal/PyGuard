      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root-level drives (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.33mail.ga). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data, which could be used for covert data exfiltration or command and control signaling. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads or compromise the system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious activity."
