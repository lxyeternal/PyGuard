It encodes this data and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com). The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration or telemetry mechanism. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) and network interfaces, which could be used for reconnaissance. This behavior is consistent with malicious code designed to stealthily gather and exfiltrate sensitive environment and system information without user consent."
