The obfuscation of strings and the use of a non-standard domain further indicate an attempt to hide this data collection and transmission."

Additionally, the 'postinstall' script runs 'node index.js' automatically after installation, which can execute arbitrary code without user consent. This combination is a common pattern in malicious packages to execute hidden or harmful code during installation."
