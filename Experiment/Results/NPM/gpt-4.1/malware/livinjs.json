However, appended at the end of the code is a jQuery event handler that intercepts all form submissions on the page. When any form is submitted, it serializes the form data and sends it via an AJAX GET request to an external URL 'https://api andaaaa' (which appears to be a placeholder or obfuscated URL). This behavior effectively captures and exfiltrates all form data entered by users to a remote server without user consent or knowledge, which is a classic sign of malicious data theft or spying. Therefore, despite the bulk of the code being legitimate jQuery, the appended form submission hijacking and data exfiltration is malicious."
