      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares a large number of dependencies with suspicious, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The package names use Latin-like filler words and are grouped under multiple unusual scopes such as '@firantea', '@juiggitea', '@npmteasources', and '@womhla6stea'. This pattern is typical of malicious or typosquatting packages designed to evade detection and potentially execute malicious code when installed. Additionally, the repository URL and author fields are empty or generic, and the scripts section contains no meaningful commands, which is common in malicious packages that rely on dependencies to execute harmful payloads. Without further source code inspection, the presence of these suspicious dependencies strongly indicates malicious intent."
