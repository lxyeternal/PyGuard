It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction and potentially for exfiltration or command-and-control. The code also attempts to gather file listings from system drives (commented out but present), indicating potential reconnaissance behavior. This data collection and exfiltration without user consent is characteristic of malicious spyware or backdoor activity."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the description 'bitfinex whitehat package' could be an attempt to appear trustworthy, but the lack of author information and the unusual version number (99.10.9) are also suspicious."
