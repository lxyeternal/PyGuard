It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain (cnsnlr0poqvrt6glausgq83ue5rsr45nz.oast.pro), which is likely a collaborator or attacker-controlled domain used for data exfiltration. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and transmission, which is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation without visible output can be used to execute malicious payloads or perform unwanted actions silently. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the use of a silent preinstall script is a common tactic in malicious packages."
