      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the package name, current directory, home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, IP addresses, and package metadata. It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com). The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration or telemetry mechanism. The code also attempts to gather file listings from common drive letters (commented out), indicating potential for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with malicious code designed to fingerprint the host environment and exfiltrate sensitive information without user consent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially malicious, especially given the unusual version number '99.10.10' and the vague description 'bitfinex whitehat package' which could be an attempt to disguise malicious intent."
