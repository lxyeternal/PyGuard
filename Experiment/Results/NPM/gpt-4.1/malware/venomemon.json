It then encodes this information in hexadecimal, extracts part of it, and uses it as a subdomain in a DNS lookup query to an external ngrok-free.app domain. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or command-and-control communication, which is malicious as it leaks system information to an external server without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This means that before installation, it executes the 'index.js' file and suppresses all output and errors, which is a common technique to hide malicious activity. Additionally, the dependency 'eforemon' is suspicious and not a known popular package, potentially a typo or a malicious package designed to look similar to 'venomemon'. The combination of a hidden preinstall script and an obscure dependency suggests potential malicious behavior."
