It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (en92vjbwv3304va.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party endpoint often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment information to an external party."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the description 'don't install for poc purposes' suggests the package may be a proof-of-concept potentially demonstrating harmful behavior. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively determine the exact malicious actions, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
