This suggests the code is designed to reference or connect to potentially malicious or phishing-related domains. The obfuscation and naming convention indicate an attempt to hide its true purpose, which is a common trait in malicious code."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious behavior. The 'install' script runs an 'npm install' command that fetches a tarball from an external URL (http://a.heliohost.us/tastytreats-1.0.0.tgz) which is unusual and potentially dangerous as it executes code from an untrusted source during installation. Additionally, the dependency 'tastytreats-pg-ng-popover' is also fetched from the same external URL, which is not a standard or trusted registry. This pattern is commonly used to inject malicious code or backdoors into the environment when the package is installed."
