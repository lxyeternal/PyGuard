      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and suspicious logic that attempts to capture form input data, including sensitive fields such as passwords, and exfiltrate this data along with cookies to a remote server. Specifically, it hooks into form submit events and collects all form element names and values, encodes them along with the current URL and document cookies, and sends this information to an external URL constructed dynamically. The obfuscation via the _jevR string and the dynamic construction of event listeners and URLs is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. This behavior constitutes a form of credential and cookie theft, which is malicious."
