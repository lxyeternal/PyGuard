It also fetches the external IP address by querying an external service (https://ipinfo.io/json). Then, it packages all this data into a JSON object, URL-encodes it, and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server (app.threatest.com on port 443, path /report/). This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive personal and system information to a third-party server, which is a clear indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the author is listed as 'anonymous' and the description is a placeholder, which are common red flags for potentially untrustworthy packages. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
