It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from this data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and reconnaissance typical of malicious spyware or backdoor code."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'util-hex-encoding' and description 'azure package' do not clearly relate, which may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
