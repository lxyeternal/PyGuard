It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration and telemetry gathering, which can be used for tracking or reconnaissance by an attacker. The code attempts to exclude certain environments or hosts from sending data, possibly to evade detection or analysis. Overall, this constitutes malicious behavior as it covertly harvests and transmits sensitive system information to a remote server."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation without any tests or clear purpose. The package name and description are vague and do not clarify the intent. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the safety of this script, but running code at preinstall is a common vector for malicious behavior such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or modifying the environment."
