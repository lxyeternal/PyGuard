This behavior constitutes data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment variables, which is malicious as it leaks internal environment data to a third party without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json specifies a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node eogtktu.js'. The filename 'eogtktu.js' is obfuscated and does not follow typical naming conventions, which is suspicious. Running arbitrary JavaScript code during the preinstall phase can execute malicious code on the user's system before the package is fully installed. Without the actual content of 'eogtktu.js', it is impossible to definitively confirm malicious intent, but the presence of an obfuscated script executed automatically during installation is a common tactic used by malicious packages to run unauthorized code."
