It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (en47d1uz958z2v9.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party endpoint often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and project information to an unknown external party."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
