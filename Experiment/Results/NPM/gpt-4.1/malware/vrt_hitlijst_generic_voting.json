It then encodes this information in hex, extracts part of it, and sends it via HTTP GET requests to an external suspicious domain (lulshdazpypdagyixvqzasm9jt0fgtv0n.oast.fun). This behavior indicates data exfiltration to a potentially malicious third party, which is a clear sign of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1', which executes a JavaScript file silently during installation. This behavior is suspicious because it hides any output or errors, potentially allowing malicious code in 'index.js' to run unnoticed. Additionally, the package lists itself as a dependency ('vrt_hitlijst_generic_voting'), which can cause recursive or unexpected behavior. These factors combined suggest potential malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior that warrants further investigation of the 'index.js' file."
