This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation phase, which can be used to run malicious payloads or compromise the environment. Additionally, the description contains an email address and the version is unusually high (99.0.0), which may indicate an attempt to attract attention or disguise malicious intent. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious code, but the presence of a preinstall script running arbitrary code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
