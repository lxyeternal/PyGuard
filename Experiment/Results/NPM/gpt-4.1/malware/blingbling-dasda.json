This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install process, which can be used to run malicious code without user consent. Additionally, the package depends on 'blingbling-dasda', which is an unusual and likely suspicious package name, potentially indicating a malicious or untrusted dependency. Without inspecting 'demo1.js' or the 'blingbling-dasda' package source, this setup is considered potentially malicious."
