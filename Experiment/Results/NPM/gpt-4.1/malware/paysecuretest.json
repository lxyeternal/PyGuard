It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain name (7mukg52sxzbpv5irw8ilp8709rfh36.oastify.com), which appears to be a randomly generated or temporary domain often used for testing or exfiltration. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration and is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information without consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the description explicitly states 'Malicious package by shakti', indicating intent. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
