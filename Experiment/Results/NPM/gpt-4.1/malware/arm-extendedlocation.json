It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from this data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Collecting and exfiltrating system and user environment data without explicit user consent is considered malicious behavior, indicative of spyware or data exfiltration malware."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
