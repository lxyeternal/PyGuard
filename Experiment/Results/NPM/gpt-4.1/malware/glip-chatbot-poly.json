It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection in security testing and often abused by malware for data exfiltration or command and control. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) which could be used for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and reconnaissance typical of malicious software."
