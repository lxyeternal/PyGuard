It first tries to send this data via an HTTPS GET request with the data base64-encoded in the URL. If that fails, it falls back to exfiltrating the data via DNS queries by encoding the data into DNS request subdomains sent to a nameserver under 'haxx.cc'. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration techniques used by malware or malicious actors to stealthily leak information from a system. Although the comment claims it is for research and no sensitive data is retrieved or stored, the code itself performs unauthorized data transmission to an external domain, which is considered malicious behavior."

This means that arbitrary JavaScript code in 'src/index.js' will execute automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as installing malware, stealing data, or modifying the system. Without inspecting 'src/index.js', this automatic execution on install is suspicious and potentially malicious."
