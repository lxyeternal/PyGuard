It encodes this data and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggnsdwfyyyyyyn.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction and potentially for exfiltration or command and control. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration or telemetry without user consent, which is considered malicious."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without seeing the content of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and could be used to perform unauthorized actions on the user's system."
