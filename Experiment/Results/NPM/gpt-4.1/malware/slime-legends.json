      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using a self-invoking function with encoded strings and an eval call. Such obfuscation is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. The code uses an eval function to execute dynamically generated code, which is a red flag for potential malicious behavior. Without fully decoding the entire payload (which is impractical here due to extreme obfuscation), the use of eval with obfuscated data strongly suggests that the code is designed to conceal harmful actions such as executing unauthorized scripts, stealing data, or compromising the environment. Therefore, this code should be treated as malicious."
