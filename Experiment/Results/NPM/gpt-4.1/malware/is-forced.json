It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent or indication. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration and telemetry gathering that can be used for fingerprinting or tracking the host machine. The code attempts to exclude certain known hostnames or paths from sending data, possibly to avoid detection in some environments. Overall, this is a form of spyware or telemetry malware that silently collects and transmits sensitive system information to a remote server."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
