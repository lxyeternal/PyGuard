It encodes this data and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggnsdwfyyyyyyn.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection in security testing but can also be abused for data exfiltration. The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details without user consent, indicating covert telemetry or data exfiltration behavior. This is characteristic of malicious or spyware-like activity."
