Such naming patterns and the sheer volume of dependencies are highly suspicious and characteristic of a dependency confusion or supply chain attack attempt. The packages do not appear to be from well-known or reputable sources, and the repository URL is generic and likely empty or fake. The scripts section contains no build or install scripts, but the suspicious dependencies alone indicate potential malicious intent, as these could contain hidden malicious code executed during installation or runtime. This pattern is often used to inject malware or backdoors into projects by masquerading as legitimate dependencies."
