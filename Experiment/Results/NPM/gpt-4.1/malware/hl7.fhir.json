It constructs a hostname using environment variables and sends system data such as environment variables, running processes, kernel and network information, and critical files like /etc/hosts, /etc/passwd, and /etc/shadow encoded in base64 via curl requests to a suspicious domain (burpcollaborator.net). This behavior is indicative of data theft and unauthorized information disclosure, which is malicious."
