It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain (cm30n6w2vtc0000cv6m0gkbokucyyyyyb.oast.fun), which appears to be a collaborator or interaction server commonly used for exfiltration or testing. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration and is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but such scripts are commonly used in malicious packages to run harmful code. Additionally, the description mentions a 'dependency confiuse vulnerability,' which is a known attack vector involving typosquatting or dependency confusion, further raising suspicion."
