      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the hostname, home directory, and current directory, then encodes this data and exfiltrates it via DNS queries to a suspicious external domain (dns.dependency-c4llb4ck.0lo.org). The data is hex-encoded and sent in chunks as subdomains in DNS A record lookups, a common technique to bypass network monitoring and exfiltrate data covertly. Additionally, the code attempts to resolve a custom DNS server and sets it as a DNS server, further indicating an attempt to control or manipulate DNS traffic. The presence of a conditional exit if the hostname matches a specific value suggests an attempt to avoid detection on certain machines. Overall, this behavior is consistent with data exfiltration malware using DNS tunneling techniques."
