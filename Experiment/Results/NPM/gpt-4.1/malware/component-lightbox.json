      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name and versioning (99.0.1) and the author email do not align with typical IKEA official packages, suggesting possible impersonation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious activity."
