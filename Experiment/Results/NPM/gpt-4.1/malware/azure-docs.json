It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server at '425a2.rt11.ml' on port 443. The obfuscation and the nature of data collected (system paths, user info, network info) combined with exfiltration to a suspicious external domain strongly indicate malicious behavior, likely for unauthorized data harvesting or reconnaissance."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
