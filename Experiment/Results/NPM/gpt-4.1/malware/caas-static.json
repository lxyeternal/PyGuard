This behavior is suspicious because it acts as a data exfiltration mechanism, potentially leaking sensitive or internal data fetched from the first URL to an external server controlled by an attacker. The use of a Pipedream URL (a platform often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests) further suggests this is intended for unauthorized data collection or spying."
