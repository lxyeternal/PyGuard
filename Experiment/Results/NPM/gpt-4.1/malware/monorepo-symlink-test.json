It then sends this information to an external server (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com) via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request. The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and often abused by malware for command and control or data exfiltration, indicates potential malicious intent. The code also attempts to gather file listings from common drive letters (commented out but present), which suggests possible reconnaissance behavior. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware that stealthily collects and transmits sensitive system information without user consent."
