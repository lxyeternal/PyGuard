This behavior can be used to verify if the package is running in an authorized environment or to exfiltrate information about the host system's usage. The domain '0xlupin.com' and the subdomain structure suggest a custom or potentially suspicious command and control or tracking server. While the code itself does not perform overtly harmful actions like data deletion or code injection, the network call to an external, potentially untrusted server without user consent is a common trait of malicious or spyware-like behavior."
