This behavior is highly suspicious as it attempts to fetch data or execute code from an external, potentially malicious server during the package installation process. Additionally, the description 'hijacked by faique' and the author field suggest the package may have been compromised. The dependencies also have unusual names that mimic legitimate packages but are likely malicious or typosquatting attempts."
