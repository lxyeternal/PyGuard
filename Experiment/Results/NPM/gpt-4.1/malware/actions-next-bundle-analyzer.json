It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain '425a2.33mail.ga' on port 443. The data sent includes potentially sensitive details about the user's environment and filesystem. The code also performs DNS lookups on generated domain names based on the collected data, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it gathers private system information and transmits it covertly to an external server without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
