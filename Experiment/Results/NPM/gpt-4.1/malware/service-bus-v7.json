It encodes this information and sends DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing or exfiltration. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out), indicating potential for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration or telemetry without user consent, which is considered malicious."

Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
