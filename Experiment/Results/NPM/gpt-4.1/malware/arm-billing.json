It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent or notification. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes. The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The presence of multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or analysis environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."
