This script can execute arbitrary code during the installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the package lists itself '@serenity-web/common-assets' as a dependency, which can cause recursive or unexpected behavior. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', the presence of a preinstall script running a local JavaScript file is suspicious and potentially malicious."
