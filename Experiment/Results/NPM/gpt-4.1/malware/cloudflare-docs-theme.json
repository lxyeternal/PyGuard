It also collects all environment variables from the process. It then sends all this information to a remote Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is malicious. The code effectively leaks potentially sensitive environment variables and system details to an external server, which can be used for reconnaissance or further attacks."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Additionally, the package depends on itself ('cloudflare-docs-theme' with a very high version number), which is unusual and may be an attempt to confuse or cause dependency resolution issues. The combination of a self-referential dependency and a preinstall script suggests potential malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior that warrants further inspection of the 'index.js' file."
