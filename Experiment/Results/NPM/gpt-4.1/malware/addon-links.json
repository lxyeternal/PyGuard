      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root-level and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which can be used for covert data exfiltration or command and control communication. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has no author information and a misleading description ('azure package') which could be an attempt to appear legitimate. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local script is a common vector for malicious activity."
