      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the description and author fields mention 'psycho_012 hackerone', which could be an attempt to appear trustworthy but does not guarantee safety. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious code execution."
