This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Additionally, the package name 'cangularjs' is similar to the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests this package may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks by masquerading as a legitimate package. The repository and author information point to a GitHub user named 'serialfuzzer', which is known for security research and fuzzing, further indicating this package might be a proof-of-concept or malicious test package."
