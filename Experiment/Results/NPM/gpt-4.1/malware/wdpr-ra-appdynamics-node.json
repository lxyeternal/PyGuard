It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain name (ck0mck22vtc0000a6gkggjokgjoyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is likely controlled by an attacker. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration and is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information without user consent."

This means that any code inside 'index.js' will execute automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, downloading malware, or compromising the system. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially given the package name and description referencing 'HackerOne Tester', which may indicate testing or exploitation purposes."
