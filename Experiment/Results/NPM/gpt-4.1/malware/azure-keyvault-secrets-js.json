It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is likely controlled by an attacker. The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration or telemetry backdoor. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) indicating potential for further data collection. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious spyware or backdoor functionality designed to stealthily gather and exfiltrate sensitive system information without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'azure-keyvault-secrets-js' and description 'azure whitehat package' may be attempting to impersonate a legitimate Azure package to gain trust. The absence of author information and the unusual version number '99.10.9' further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
