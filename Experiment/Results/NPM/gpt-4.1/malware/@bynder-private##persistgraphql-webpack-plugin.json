It then encodes this information and sends it via HTTPS POST requests to an external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and unauthorized telemetry collection, which is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive system information to a remote server without user consent."
