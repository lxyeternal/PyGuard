After the download completes, it immediately executes this file using 'child_process.exec'. Since '.lnk' files are Windows shortcut files, executing them can trigger arbitrary commands or programs. This behavior is potentially malicious because it downloads and runs external code without user consent or validation, which can lead to remote code execution or compromise of the system."
