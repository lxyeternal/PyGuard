It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com), which is likely controlled by an attacker. The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration or telemetry backdoor. The code also attempts to gather file listings from common drive letters (commented out), indicating potential for further data collection. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious code designed to stealthily gather and exfiltrate sensitive environment and system information to an attacker-controlled server."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm if it is malicious, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
