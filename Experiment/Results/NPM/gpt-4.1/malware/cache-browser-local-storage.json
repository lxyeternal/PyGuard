      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it silently gathers and transmits private system information to a remote server without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name and description ('cache-browser-local-storage' and 'azure package') do not clearly relate, which may indicate an attempt to disguise malicious intent. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local script is a common vector for malicious code."
