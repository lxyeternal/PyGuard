This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means that any code inside index.js will be executed automatically during the package installation, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the package depends on itself ('surf-sharekit-frontend'), which is unusual and can cause dependency resolution issues or be used to mask malicious intent. The description attempts to reassure the user that there is no malicious code, which can be a red flag. Without seeing the contents of index.js, the presence of a preinstall script running arbitrary code is suspicious and potentially malicious."
