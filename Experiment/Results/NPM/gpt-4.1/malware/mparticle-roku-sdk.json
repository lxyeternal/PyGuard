It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain name (oastify.com, which is commonly used for testing DNS and HTTP exfiltration). This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, which is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information without consent."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the description and author fields referencing 'psycho_012 hackerone' and the unusually high version number suggest this package may be a test or malicious package rather than a legitimate SDK."
