      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json specifies a 'preinstall' script that runs './install.sh'. This is suspicious because it executes a shell script before installation, which can run arbitrary code on the user's system. Additionally, the 'main' field points to 'install.sh', which is unusual as it typically points to a JavaScript entry file. The package also lists itself as a dependency ('emob-lp'), which can cause recursive or unexpected behavior. These factors combined suggest potential malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior that warrants caution."
