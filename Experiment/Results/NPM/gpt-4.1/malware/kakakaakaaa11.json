      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a reverse shell by connecting to a remote IP address (192.168.255.128) on port 443. Upon connection, it spawns a shell (/bin/sh) and pipes the input and output of the shell through the network socket, effectively allowing the remote host to execute arbitrary commands on the infected machine. The code also attempts to reconnect every 5 seconds if the connection is closed, indicating persistence. This behavior is typical of backdoor or remote access trojan (RAT) malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious and potentially malicious scripts. The 'preinstall' script runs a command to add a new user with a preset password on the system, which is a serious security risk and unauthorized system modification. The 'postinstall' script executes a shell script named 'evil.sh', which by its name strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the dependency 'event-stream' has a known history of being compromised in the past, which adds to the suspicion. Overall, these elements indicate malicious behavior aimed at unauthorized system access and execution of harmful code."
