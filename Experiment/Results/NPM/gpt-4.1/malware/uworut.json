Upon deobfuscation and analysis, the code dynamically constructs and injects an iframe into the document. The iframe's source URL is constructed from obfuscated strings and points to an external domain (e.g., 'bstear.icu' or similar suspicious domain patterns). Injecting hidden iframes from external sources is a known malicious behavior often used for drive-by downloads, click fraud, or loading malicious content without user consent. Additionally, the code attempts to read meta tags and manipulate the DOM in a way that suggests it is trying to evade detection or conditionally load content. These behaviors strongly indicate that the code is designed to load external malicious content stealthily, which is a malicious action."
