      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, IP addresses, DNS servers, and package information. It encodes this data and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com). The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration mechanism. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) and network interfaces, which indicates reconnaissance behavior. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious code designed to stealthily gather and exfiltrate sensitive environment and system information without user consent."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and often associated with malicious packages."
