      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'angjlarjs' is a typo-squatting attempt on the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it is designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository and author information point to a GitHub user known for fuzzing or testing security issues, further indicating this package is likely malicious or a proof-of-concept for attack vectors."
