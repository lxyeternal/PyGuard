It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or telemetry malware that exfiltrates system information without user consent. The presence of multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or analysis environments. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily gather and transmit sensitive system data to a remote server, which is malicious behavior."
