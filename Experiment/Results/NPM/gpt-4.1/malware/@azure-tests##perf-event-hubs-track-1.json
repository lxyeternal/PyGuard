It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is likely controlled by an attacker. The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration or telemetry backdoor. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) indicating potential for further data collection. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious spyware or backdoor functionality designed to stealthily gather and exfiltrate sensitive environment and system information without user consent."
