      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file named 'npm.mov' from a suspicious IP address (http://103.179.142.171/npm/npm.mov) and saves it as 'sqlite.a'. It then runs a PowerShell script that XOR-decrypts this downloaded file into 'sql.tmp', renames it to 'preinstall.db', and executes it via 'rundll32 preinstall.db,CalculateSum 4806'. This behavior is typical of malware loaders that fetch and execute potentially harmful payloads. Additionally, it deletes and renames package files, which could be an attempt to hide or manipulate legitimate files. The use of obfuscation (XOR decryption) and execution of unknown DLL code from a downloaded file strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js' and then deletes 'index.js' with 'del index.js'. This is suspicious because it executes a JavaScript file during installation and then removes it, which is a common tactic to hide malicious code after execution. The package.json does not include 'index.js' in its exports or main entry, suggesting 'index.js' is only used during installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify what code is executed, but this pattern is a red flag for potential malicious behavior such as running unauthorized code or installing backdoors during package installation."
