This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration. Additionally, the code is labeled as a Proof of Concept (PoC) for Dependency Confusion, a known supply chain attack technique, which further suggests malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node app.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system without explicit consent. Since the package does not provide any description or author information and the main file is 'index.js' but the preinstall script runs 'app.js' (which is not referenced elsewhere), this behavior is potentially malicious and should be treated with caution."
