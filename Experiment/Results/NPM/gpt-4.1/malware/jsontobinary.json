      "malicious_behavior": "The code disables TLS certificate validation by setting NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED to 0, which is a security risk as it allows man-in-the-middle attacks. It then creates a hidden directory in the user's home directory named '.vscode' if it doesn't exist, and downloads data from an external URL ('https://npmrepos.com/checkupdate.php') using a synchronous HTTP GET request. The response body is saved to a file named 'jsontoken' inside the '.vscode' directory. This behavior is suspicious because it silently fetches and stores data from an external source without user consent or validation, potentially for tracking, credential harvesting, or other malicious purposes."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'npm install sync-request' and then executes 'node main.js' before the package is installed. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the 'main.js' file is not shown, so its behavior is unknown and could contain harmful code. The use of 'sync-request' is also notable, as it allows synchronous HTTP requests, which could be used to fetch malicious payloads or exfiltrate data during installation."
