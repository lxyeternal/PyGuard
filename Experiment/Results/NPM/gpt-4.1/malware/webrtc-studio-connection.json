It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (cmbtidbm27je8m3tmcd0ub6mm4jk7oxfn.oast.fun), which appears to be a subdomain of oast.fun, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing and potentially malicious data exfiltration. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which is considered malicious."

Additionally, the 'test' script executes a curl command to an external URL (https://ken.requestcatcher.com/), which could be used to leak information or perform unwanted network requests. These behaviors are suspicious and potentially malicious as they execute code and network requests automatically during package installation and testing."
