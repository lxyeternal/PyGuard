This behavior is unusual for a typical package and may be used to verify installation or exfiltrate information about the environment. The domain '0xlupin.com' and the subdomain pattern suggest a command-and-control or tracking server. Although the code does not explicitly send sensitive data, the act of contacting an external server without user consent can be considered malicious, especially if used for tracking or unauthorized communication."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node app.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the 'main' field is set to 'node app.js', which is not a valid entry point (it should be a file path, not a command), indicating possible obfuscation or misuse. The package name '@zettle-bo/react-router-dom' mimics a popular package name, which could be an attempt to trick users into installing it."
