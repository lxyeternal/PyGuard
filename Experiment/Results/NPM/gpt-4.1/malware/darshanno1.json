      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that runs 'node index.js' and then runs 'sh setup.sh', both with their outputs redirected to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This behavior is suspicious because it silently executes potentially arbitrary scripts without user awareness or logging. The use of 'exec' to run shell commands that include a shell script ('setup.sh') can be a vector for malicious activity, especially if the contents of 'setup.sh' are not controlled or verified. The redirection of output to /dev/null suggests an attempt to conceal the execution and any errors, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects environment information such as the current working directory (pwd), the output of a suspicious command 'c5yj0c92vtc00000pg0ggn9jygeyyyyyb' (which appears to be a random or obfuscated command), the public IP address (via curl ifconfig.me), a hardcoded string 'exposed-package', and the current user (whoami). Each piece of information is hex-encoded (using xxd -p) and then used as a subdomain in DNS queries (nslookup) to a domain under 'interactsh.com', which is a known service used for out-of-band interaction detection often leveraged by attackers to exfiltrate data or confirm code execution remotely. The code also makes an HTTP request to a canarytokens.com URL, which is a service used to detect unauthorized access or execution. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious code designed to stealthily exfiltrate environment information and confirm execution to an attacker-controlled server, indicating malicious intent."
