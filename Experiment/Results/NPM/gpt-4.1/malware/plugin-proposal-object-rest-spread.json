      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server at '425a2.rt11.ml'. The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data, which could be used for exfiltration or command and control signaling. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to run malicious payloads or compromise the system. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-proposal-object-rest-spread' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to any known official package, and the description 'azure package' is vague. The combination of an unusual preinstall script and misleading metadata suggests potential malicious intent."
