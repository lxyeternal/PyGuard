The iframe's source URL is constructed using a value extracted from an element with a specific class name. The iframe is styled to be invisible (width and height 100%, border none, display none), which is a common technique to load external content or scripts without user awareness. The URL used in the iframe source starts with 'https://ca', suggesting it loads content from an external domain. This behavior is typical of malicious scripts that attempt to load hidden content, potentially for tracking, data exfiltration, or loading further malicious payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic DOM manipulation strongly indicate malicious intent."

The iframe's source URL is constructed using a value extracted from an element with a specific class name. The URL starts with 'https://ca' and appends a path that appears to be related to 'shapps.cli' and 'ck/fl/'. This behavior is typical of malicious scripts that attempt to load external content or trackers without user consent. The iframe is styled to be invisible (width and height 100%, display none), which is a common technique to hide malicious iframes that can be used for clickjacking, tracking, or loading malicious payloads. Additionally, the script listens for the DOMContentLoaded event to perform these actions, ensuring it runs as soon as the page is ready. Overall, the obfuscation combined with hidden iframe injection from an external source indicates malicious intent."

The iframe's source URL is constructed using a value extracted from an element with a specific class name. The iframe is styled to be invisible (width and height 100%, border none, display none), which is a common technique to load external content or scripts without user awareness. The URL used in the iframe source starts with 'https://ca', suggesting it loads content from an external domain. This behavior is typical of malicious scripts that attempt to load hidden content, potentially for tracking, clickjacking, or loading further malicious payloads. The obfuscation and dynamic DOM manipulation strongly indicate malicious intent."
