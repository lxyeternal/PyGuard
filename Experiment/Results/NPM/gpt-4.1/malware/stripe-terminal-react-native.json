      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects the hostname of the machine it is running on using os.hostname() and sends it via an HTTP request to an external URL (https://eoenp5lacdw4vru.m.pipedream.net). This behavior can be considered malicious or privacy-invasive because it leaks potentially sensitive information about the user's environment to a third party without user consent. Additionally, the code imports the 'fs' module but does not use it, which might indicate incomplete or obfuscated code. The use of an external endpoint controlled by an unknown party to exfiltrate data is a common pattern in malicious scripts."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious scripts that run 'node index.js --save-prod' during preinstall, postinstall, and start lifecycle events. This means that arbitrary code in index.js will be executed automatically during installation and start, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the version number is set to an unrealistic '999.99.99', which may indicate an attempt to bypass version checks or detection. The presence of both 'request' and 'requests' dependencies is unusual and could be an attempt to confuse or exploit. Without the actual index.js code, the exact malicious payload cannot be confirmed, but the automatic execution of index.js on install is a strong red flag for potential malicious behavior."
