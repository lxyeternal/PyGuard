It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server at '425a2.33mail.ga' on port 443. The data sent includes potentially sensitive details about the user's environment and filesystem. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it gathers private system data without user consent and transmits it to an external server."
