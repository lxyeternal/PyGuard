It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which can be used for tracking or exfiltration. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name and version appear to mimic a legitimate package ('opentelemetry-instrumentation-azure-sdk') but with an unusually high version number (99.10.9) and minimal metadata, which is a common tactic in typosquatting or malicious packages. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a red flag for potential malicious activity."
