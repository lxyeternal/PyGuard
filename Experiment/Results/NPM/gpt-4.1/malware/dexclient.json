      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that runs 'node index.js' and then runs 'sh setup.sh', both with their outputs redirected to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This behavior is suspicious because it silently runs potentially arbitrary scripts without user awareness or output, which is a common tactic in malicious code to execute hidden payloads or setup scripts. The use of 'exec' to run shell commands that invoke other scripts without validation or logging can be exploited to run harmful commands on the host system."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects environment information such as the current working directory (pwd), the output of a suspicious command 'c5yj0c92vtc00000pg0ggn9jygeyyyyyb' (which appears to be a random or obfuscated command), the public IP address (via curl ifconfig.me), a hardcoded string 'exposed-package', and the current user (whoami). It encodes these pieces of information in hexadecimal (using xxd -p) and performs DNS lookups (nslookup) to subdomains of 'c5yj0c92vtc00000pg0ggn9jygeyyyyyb.interactsh.com'. Interactsh is a known service used for out-of-band interaction detection, often leveraged by attackers to exfiltrate data or confirm code execution remotely. Additionally, it makes an HTTP request to a canarytokens.com URL, which is a service used to detect unauthorized access or code execution. This behavior indicates the code is attempting to leak environment information to an external server and signal its execution, which is typical of malicious or backdoor code designed for reconnaissance or exfiltration."
