It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggnsdwfyyyyyyn.interactsh.com), which is likely controlled by an attacker. The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration or telemetry backdoor mechanism. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code designed to stealthily gather and transmit sensitive environment and system data without user consent."
