It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (burpcollaborator.net), which is a domain commonly used for security testing and can be replaced with other similar services. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information to a third party."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts or perform unwanted actions on the user's system. Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and is a common vector for malicious activity in npm packages."
