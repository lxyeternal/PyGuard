This behavior is suspicious because it causes the package installation process to make an outbound network request without user consent, which can be used for data exfiltration, tracking, or triggering remote code execution if combined with other scripts. Even though the description claims the package is not malicious, the presence of this network call in a lifecycle script is a red flag and considered potentially malicious."
