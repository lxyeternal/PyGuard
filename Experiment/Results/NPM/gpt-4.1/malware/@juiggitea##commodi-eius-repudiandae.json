      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains an unusually large number of dependencies, all with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The naming pattern suggests these packages could be part of a dependency confusion or supply chain attack, where malicious packages are published under similar or random names to trick users or automated systems into installing them. Additionally, there are no scripts or other metadata that would justify such a large dependency tree, and the repository URL does not provide any indication of legitimacy. This pattern is highly suspicious and typical of malicious or compromised packages designed to execute malicious code when installed or used."
