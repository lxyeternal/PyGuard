      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'anbularjs' is a typo-squatting attempt on the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. Without the content of 'new.js', the exact malicious actions cannot be fully determined, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
