      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root-level and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from the collected data, which may be used for covert data exfiltration or command and control communication. The presence of multiple hostname and path checks to exclude certain environments suggests attempts to evade detection or analysis. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."
