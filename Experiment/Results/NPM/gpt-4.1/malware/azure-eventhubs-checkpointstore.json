      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces, IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com). The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration mechanism. The code also attempts DNS lookups on crafted domain names containing encoded system data, which can be used to leak information covertly. This behavior is consistent with malicious spyware or backdoor functionality designed to stealthily gather and exfiltrate sensitive environment and system information without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
