This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This means that before installation, it executes the 'index.js' file and suppresses all output and errors. This behavior is suspicious because it runs arbitrary code during installation without any visible output or logging, which is a common technique used to hide malicious actions such as downloading malware, stealing data, or modifying the system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively say what it does, but the presence of a hidden preinstall script is a red flag for potential malicious behavior."
