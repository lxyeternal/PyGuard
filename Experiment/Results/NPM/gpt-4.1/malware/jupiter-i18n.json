It then encodes this information in hexadecimal and sends it via a POST request to an external URL (https://eozpdddh3tifjo.m.pipedream.net). This behavior constitutes data exfiltration, which is malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment details to an unknown third party without user consent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding its execution and any output or errors. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts run automatically when the package is installed, potentially executing arbitrary code without the user's knowledge. Additionally, the description states this is a proof of concept for dependency confusion, which is a known attack vector where malicious packages are published to public registries with names matching internal packages to trick systems into installing them. The combination of a hidden preinstall script and the context of dependency confusion strongly suggests malicious intent."
