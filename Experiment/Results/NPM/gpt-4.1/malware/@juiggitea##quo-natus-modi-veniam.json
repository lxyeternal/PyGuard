      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains an unusually large number of dependencies with suspicious, autogenerated-like scoped package names (e.g., @firantea/*, @juiggitea/*, @npmteasources/*, @womhla6stea/*) that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The naming pattern resembles nonsense or randomly generated words, which is a common tactic used in malicious or typosquatting packages to evade detection. There are no scripts defined except a default failing test script, which is not suspicious by itself, but the sheer volume and nature of dependencies strongly suggest this package is a dependency trojan or a malicious package designed to pull in many potentially harmful sub-packages. Without further source code inspection, this dependency list alone is a strong indicator of malicious intent or at least a high risk of malicious behavior."
