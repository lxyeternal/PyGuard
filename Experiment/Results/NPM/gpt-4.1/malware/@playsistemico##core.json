      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This script execution during installation is suspicious because it can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine without explicit consent. Additionally, the package depends on itself '@playsistemico/core' with the same version, which is unusual and can cause recursive or unexpected behavior. The combination of a self-dependency and a preinstall script that runs code makes this package potentially malicious or at least suspicious and warrants further inspection of the 'index.js' file content."
