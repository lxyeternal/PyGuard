It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain (zor3bhywugrwa7bj1pciehj5fwlq9gx5.oastify.com), which appears to be a unique subdomain likely used for out-of-band interaction testing or data exfiltration. This behavior is characteristic of telemetry or data exfiltration malware, as it gathers potentially sensitive user and environment information without user consent and transmits it to a third party."
