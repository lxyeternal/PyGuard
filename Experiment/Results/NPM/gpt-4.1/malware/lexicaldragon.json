This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent. Additionally, it writes a local file named 'locatethisfileforpoc' which may be used as a marker or for persistence. The combination of unauthorized data collection and transmission to an external endpoint is considered malicious."

Running arbitrary code during install phases is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the presence of both 'request' and 'requests' dependencies is unusual and may indicate an attempt to confuse or exploit dependency resolution. Without the actual index.js code, the exact behavior is unknown, but the setup is highly suspicious and potentially malicious."
