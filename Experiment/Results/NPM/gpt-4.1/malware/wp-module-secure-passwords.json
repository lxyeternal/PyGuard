It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external, suspicious domain (bluehost-ccpv1rf2vtc00005nvw0ggmpohryyyyyb.mybeautifuliframe.com) without user consent or notification. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration and can be considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information to an unknown third party."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the safety of this script. Additionally, the description 'H1 research - please do not delete for 2 hours, sorry for the hassle!' is unusual and may indicate temporary or experimental code. The combination of an unknown preinstall script and unusual description suggests potential malicious behavior or at least a risk of executing unintended code."
