      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on a Discord CDN) into the local 'node_modules' directory, then sets up a file watcher on this executable. Whenever the executable file changes, the code automatically executes it using child_process.exec. This behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious because it downloads and runs an external binary without user consent or validation, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or malware infection. Additionally, the code calls a function named sendDiscordWebhook() after download, which is undefined here but suggests possible data exfiltration or communication with an attacker-controlled server."

The name resembles legitimate Discord-related packages but is likely a typo-squatting or malicious package designed to execute harmful code when installed or used. Without further code inspection, the presence of this unknown dependency is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior."
