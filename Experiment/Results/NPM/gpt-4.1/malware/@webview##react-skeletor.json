      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This script executes the index.js file silently before installation, suppressing all output and errors. This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to run arbitrary or malicious code during installation without the user's knowledge. Additionally, the package depends on itself '@webview/react-skeletor' with a different version, which is unusual and may cause dependency resolution issues or be used to pull in malicious versions. The combination of a silent preinstall script and a self-referential dependency strongly suggests potential malicious intent."
