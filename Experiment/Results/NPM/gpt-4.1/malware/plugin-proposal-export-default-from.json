      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root-level and drive-level paths (e.g., C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from the collected data. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it gathers and transmits private system information without user consent. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments, which is typical in malicious code."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious payloads or compromise the system. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-proposal-export-default-from' mimics a legitimate Babel plugin but has an unusually high version number and a vague description 'azure package', which may be an attempt to disguise malicious intent."
