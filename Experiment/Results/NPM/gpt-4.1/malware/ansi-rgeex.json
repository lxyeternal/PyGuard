After the download completes, it immediately executes this file using 'child_process.exec'. Since '.lnk' files are Windows shortcut files, executing it can trigger arbitrary commands or programs on the user's machine. This behavior is potentially dangerous and typical of malware or malicious scripts that download and run remote payloads without user consent or validation."
