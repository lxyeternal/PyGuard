It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent or notification. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes. The data collection includes potentially sensitive file paths and directory contents, which can expose private user data. The presence of multiple hostname and path checks to exclude certain environments suggests an attempt to evade detection or analysis in known environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'node-core-library' and version '99.10.9' are unusual and may be attempting to impersonate a core or trusted package. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
