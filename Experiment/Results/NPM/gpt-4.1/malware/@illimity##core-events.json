This can be used to redirect users to potentially malicious sites or to load and execute remote scripts without user consent. The IP address used instead of a domain name is suspicious and often associated with malicious activity. Therefore, this behavior is considered malicious as it can lead to unwanted redirection or execution of untrusted code."
