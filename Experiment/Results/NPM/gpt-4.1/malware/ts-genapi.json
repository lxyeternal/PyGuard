It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection in security testing but can also be abused for data exfiltration. The code also attempts to enumerate files from system drives (commented out but present), indicating potential for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration typically seen in malicious or spyware code."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm if it is malicious, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
