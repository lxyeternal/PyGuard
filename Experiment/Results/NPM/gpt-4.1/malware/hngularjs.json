This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'hngularjs' is similar to the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be attempting a dependency confusion attack by masquerading as a legitimate package to trick users or automated systems into installing it."
