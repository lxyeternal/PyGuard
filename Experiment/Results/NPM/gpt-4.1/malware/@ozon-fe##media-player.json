      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects potentially sensitive environment information such as the current directory (__dirname), the hostname of the machine, and the username of the OS user. It then encodes this data into hex and sends it out via DNS queries to a remote domain (for-research.ru). This technique is commonly used for data exfiltration or tracking, as DNS queries can bypass some network monitoring and firewalls. The use of randomized IDs and multiple DNS servers further suggests an attempt to obfuscate or reliably transmit this data. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly leaking system information to an external server."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means arbitrary code in 'index.js' will execute on the victim's machine during installation, which can be used to perform malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or other harmful behavior. Although the description claims the code is not malicious, the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious activity and should be treated as suspicious unless the 'index.js' content is verified safe."
