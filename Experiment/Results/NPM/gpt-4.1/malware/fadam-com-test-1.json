      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the hostname, current user, and current working directory by executing system commands ('hostname', 'whoami', 'pwd'). It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it out via DNS queries to a remote domain ('fadam.eu') using 'nslookup'. This technique is a form of data exfiltration over DNS, which is often used to bypass network security controls and stealthily leak information from a compromised system. Therefore, the code exhibits malicious behavior aimed at covertly extracting system information."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This means that before installation, it executes the 'index.js' file and suppresses all output and errors. Running arbitrary code during installation is a common vector for malicious behavior, especially when the executed script's content is unknown. Without inspecting 'index.js', this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious."
