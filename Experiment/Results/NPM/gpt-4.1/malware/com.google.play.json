It attempts to gather sensitive system information by running various commands such as 'env', 'ps aux', and reading sensitive files like '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow'. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via HTTP POST requests to a remote server with a domain under 'burpcollaborator.net', which is commonly used for security testing and exfiltration. Additionally, it performs ping requests to similar suspicious domains. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate sensitive environment and system data to an external attacker-controlled server during the package installation process."
