It then encodes this information into a custom DNS query format and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious domain (425a2.rt11.ml). Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same domain. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration and telemetry collection without user consent. The code also contains multiple checks to avoid running or sending data on certain hostnames or paths, indicating an attempt to evade detection or analysis environments. Overall, this is a form of spyware or backdoor functionality designed to stealthily gather and transmit sensitive system information to a remote server."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has no author information and a very generic description, which are common red flags. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious code execution."
