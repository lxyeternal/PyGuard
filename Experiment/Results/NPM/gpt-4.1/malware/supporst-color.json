      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file named 'README.txt.lnk' from a remote URL hosted on Discord's CDN and saves it to the local directory. After the download completes, it immediately executes this file using 'child_process.exec'. The '.lnk' extension indicates a Windows shortcut file, which can be used to execute arbitrary commands or programs. Automatically downloading and executing a file from an external source without validation or user consent is a common vector for malware distribution and can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system. Therefore, this behavior is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. Running arbitrary code during the preinstall phase is suspicious because it executes code before the package is fully installed, which can be exploited to run malicious scripts on the user's system. Legitimate packages rarely need to run code at preinstall, and this behavior is a common vector for malware or unwanted side effects."
