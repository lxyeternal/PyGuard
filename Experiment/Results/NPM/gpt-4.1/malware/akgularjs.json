      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'akgularjs' is a typo-squatting variant of the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository and author information point to a user named 'serialfuzzer', which is known for security research and potentially malicious test packages. Overall, the presence of a preinstall script running an unknown file combined with the suspicious naming and keywords indicates malicious intent."
