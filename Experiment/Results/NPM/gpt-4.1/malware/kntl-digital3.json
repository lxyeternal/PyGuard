This behavior constitutes data exfiltration, as it collects potentially sensitive information about the file system and transmits it to a remote server without user consent, which is considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node app.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the dependencies include 'fs' and 'os' packages from npm, which are not the standard Node.js built-in modules but rather placeholder or potentially malicious packages (e.g., 'fs' version '0.0.1-security' is a known placeholder package). Including these can be a vector for malicious code. The combination of a preinstall script executing code and suspicious dependencies suggests potential malicious behavior."
