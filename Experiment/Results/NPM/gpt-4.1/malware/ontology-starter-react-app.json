It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (eon84z9ti0r7hjk.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party endpoint often used for capturing incoming requests for testing or potentially exfiltrating data. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration and is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive system and user information without consent."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and often associated with malicious packages."
