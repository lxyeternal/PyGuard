It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing and can be used for data exfiltration. The code also attempts to enumerate files from system drives (commented out but present), indicating potential reconnaissance. This behavior is consistent with malicious telemetry or data exfiltration, potentially for spying or reconnaissance purposes without user consent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name and description appear generic and possibly misleading ('azure-ai-text-analytics' with description 'azure whitehat package'), which could be an attempt to impersonate a legitimate package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious code."
