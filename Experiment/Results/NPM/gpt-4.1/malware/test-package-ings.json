It then sends all this potentially sensitive data via an HTTPS POST request to an external endpoint (enjglpdgtgrbn4b.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party service often used for capturing webhooks or data. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Additionally, the dependencies 'http', 'https', and 'os' are not standard or commonly used packages and appear to be suspicious or potentially malicious, as these names correspond to Node.js core modules and should not be installed from npm. The 'http' package version '0.0.1-security' is known to be a placeholder package used to patch vulnerabilities but can be abused. Overall, the combination of a preinstall script executing code and suspicious dependencies suggests potential malicious behavior."
