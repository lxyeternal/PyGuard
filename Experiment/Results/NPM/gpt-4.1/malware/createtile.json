Specifically, it constructs a hostname based on the local machine's hostname and user, then pings and sends base64-encoded outputs of environment variables, running processes, system version info, network configuration, and critical files such as /etc/hosts, /etc/passwd, and /etc/shadow to a remote URL under the domain 'burpcollaborator.net', which is commonly used for penetration testing and malicious callbacks. This behavior is indicative of data theft and remote reconnaissance, confirming the package is malicious."
