      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration purposes. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'web-types' and version '99.10.9' are unusual and may be attempting to impersonate legitimate packages. The 'index.js' file executed in 'preinstall' could contain malicious code, which is a common tactic in malicious npm packages to run code on the user's machine during installation."
