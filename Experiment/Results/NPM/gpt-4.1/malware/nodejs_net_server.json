      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a TCP server that listens on port 7353 and accepts commands from connected clients. It can execute arbitrary shell commands via the 'cmd' command, capture screenshots and video from the host machine's desktop/webcam using ffmpeg, and send files or directories from the host machine to a remote client specified by IP and port. The code also allows recursive file searching and reading, and transmits file contents over the network. This behavior effectively creates a backdoor or remote access trojan (RAT) that can be controlled remotely to exfiltrate files, execute commands, and capture screen/video without user consent, which is malicious."

This behavior suggests that the script may be downloading and executing a potentially malicious executable from an external source, which is a common pattern in malware or unauthorized code execution. Running external executables from untrusted URLs poses a significant security risk."
