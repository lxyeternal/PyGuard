It then sends all this collected data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (eo56j4tfa20w1b7.m.pipedream.net). This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, which is malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive system information to a third party without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Additionally, the description field 'Hacked By Nova' and author 'Nova Security' suggest potential tampering or malicious intent. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to fully assess, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
