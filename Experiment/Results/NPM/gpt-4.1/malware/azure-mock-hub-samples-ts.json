It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from this data. The behavior of gathering detailed system and user environment information and exfiltrating it to a remote server without user consent is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions without user consent. Since the content of 'index.js' is unknown, this behavior is potentially malicious and should be investigated further."
