      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information into a custom DNS query format and performs DNS lookups on a suspicious domain (425a2.rt11.ml). Additionally, it sends the collected data via an HTTPS POST request to the same domain. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and unauthorized telemetry collection. The code attempts to exclude certain environments or paths from sending data, likely to evade detection or analysis. Overall, this is a form of spyware or backdoor that silently harvests and transmits sensitive system information to a remote server without user consent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts or compromise the system. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and is a common vector for malicious activity in npm packages."
