      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root-level and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from the collected data, which may be used for exfiltration or command-and-control signaling. The presence of multiple hostname and path checks to exclude certain environments suggests attempts to evade detection or analysis. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-node-resolve' and version '99.10.9' seem unusual and may be attempting to impersonate legitimate packages. The description 'azure package' is vague and does not clarify the package's purpose."
