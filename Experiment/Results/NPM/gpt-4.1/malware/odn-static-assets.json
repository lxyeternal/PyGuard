      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that executes './index.js' before installation. Running a JavaScript file directly as a script during installation is unusual and potentially dangerous, as it can execute arbitrary code on the user's system without explicit consent. This behavior is often used in malicious packages to run harmful code during installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively confirm malicious intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is suspicious and a common vector for malicious behavior."
