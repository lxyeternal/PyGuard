      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a PowerShell command with the '-ep bypass' flag, which disables script execution policy restrictions, allowing potentially unsafe scripts to run. The command is base64-encoded, which is a common technique to obfuscate the payload and avoid detection. Decoding the base64 string reveals that it creates a TCP client connection to a remote IP address (10.20.30.22) on port 4443 and sets up a reverse shell by redirecting input/output streams. This behavior is typical of malware or unauthorized remote access tools that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine remotely. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at establishing a covert remote shell connection."
