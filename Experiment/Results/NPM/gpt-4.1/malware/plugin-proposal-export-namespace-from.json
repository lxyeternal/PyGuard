      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive information about the user's environment and filesystem. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data, which could be used for covert data exfiltration or command and control signaling. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from' and version '99.10.9' do not align with typical naming/versioning conventions, and the description 'azure package' is vague. The absence of author information and the presence of a preinstall script without clear purpose are red flags indicating potential malicious behavior."
