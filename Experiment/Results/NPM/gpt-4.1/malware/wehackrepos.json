It then attempts to send this information to an external server via a curl request to a suspicious URL (https://a8jwqfkw427wnp2pmoybsia960cr0io7.oastify.com). Afterward, it processes the output and performs DNS lookups to a domain (bind9-or-callback-server.com) that appears to be used for callback or exfiltration purposes. This behavior indicates data exfiltration and potential command and control communication, which is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation without visible output can be used to execute malicious payloads or perform unwanted actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has no dependencies and minimal metadata, which can be a tactic to avoid detection. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the hidden preinstall script is a strong indicator of potentially malicious intent."
