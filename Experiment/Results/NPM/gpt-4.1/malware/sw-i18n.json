It then pipes the output through xxd and nslookup commands targeting the same domain. This behavior indicates data exfiltration attempts and DNS queries to an external server, which is typical of malicious code trying to gather system info and communicate with a command and control server or exfiltrate data. The use of exec with such commands and external network requests without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1'. This means that before installation, it executes the 'index.js' file and suppresses all output and errors. The description 'RCE POC BY REWTERZ' suggests this is a proof of concept for Remote Code Execution, indicating potentially malicious intent. Running arbitrary code during installation without user awareness is a common vector for malware or backdoors."
