It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external endpoint (enjglpdgtgrbn4b.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party service often used for capturing webhooks or data for testing but can also be used by attackers to exfiltrate data. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, which is malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive system and environment information to an external server without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to run malicious payloads. Additionally, the dependencies include 'http', 'https', and 'os' packages from npm, which are not the standard Node.js built-in modules but third-party packages with those names. These packages are known to be deprecated or security placeholder packages and can be used to introduce malicious code. Overall, the combination of a preinstall script executing code and suspicious dependencies indicates potential malicious behavior."
