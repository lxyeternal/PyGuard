      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from the collected data, which can be used for covert data exfiltration or command and control signaling. The presence of multiple hostname and path checks to exclude certain environments suggests attempts to evade detection or analysis. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package has a very high version number (99.10.9) which is unusual and may be an attempt to impersonate a legitimate package. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
