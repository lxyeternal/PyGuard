      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains an extremely large number of dependencies, all with unusual and nonsensical package names that resemble randomly generated Latin-like phrases. All dependencies are scoped packages from multiple uncommon scopes (e.g., @juiggitea, @diotobtea, @hishpr, @patrten, @taktikangea) which do not correspond to well-known or reputable sources. This pattern is highly suspicious and typical of malicious or typosquatting packages designed to hide malicious code within numerous dependencies. Additionally, the scripts section contains only a placeholder test script, which is common in malicious packages to avoid detection. The repository URL points to a GitHub repository under the same suspicious namespace, but without further verification, it is likely a facade. Overall, the package is very likely malicious or at least suspicious and should be treated with caution."
