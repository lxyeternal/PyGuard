      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including environment variables, OS details, CPU info, network interfaces (excluding loopback and localhost), current working directory, user info, and package.json metadata. It then decompresses and evaluates a large Brotli-compressed string via eval(). The use of eval on decompressed data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it can execute arbitrary code hidden in the compressed payload. Additionally, the code disables NODE_NO_EVAl environment variable, which could be an attempt to bypass Node.js security restrictions. Overall, this behavior is typical of malware or backdoor code designed to gather system info and execute hidden payloads."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json references scripts (./scripts/init.js and ./scripts/rsh.js) that are executed via npm scripts, including running init.js in the background with the test script. The repository URL and author name suggest a potential security research or hacking context ('51pwn', 'rshNpm'). The presence of scripts named 'rsh.js' (commonly shorthand for 'remote shell') and the background execution of init.js are suspicious and could indicate that these scripts establish unauthorized remote access or execute malicious payloads. Without the actual script contents, the package.json alone does not definitively prove maliciousness, but the naming, script usage, and repository context strongly suggest potentially malicious or backdoor behavior."
