According to the comment, this is done to identify machines vulnerable to npmjs org/package claim. There is no code that modifies, deletes, or damages the system or data. The data collection is limited to environment variables and network info, which could be sensitive but is done transparently with a comment and contact information. Therefore, while it collects and transmits system information, it is not inherently malicious but should be used with informed consent."
