It then sends this data via a POST request to a suspicious external server (ckhp9tz2vtc0000ykrxggj34g7cyyyyyk.oast.fun), which is likely controlled by an attacker. After sending the data, it deletes the 'index.js' file, likely to cover its tracks. Additionally, it overrides console.log to disable logging, which can be used to hide its activity. These behaviors indicate clear malicious intent to exfiltrate data and evade detection."
