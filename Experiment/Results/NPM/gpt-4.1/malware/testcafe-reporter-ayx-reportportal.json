It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP POST request to an external server (97em8ahl897zdkovig5207qgo7u2iteh3.oastify.com). This behavior constitutes data exfiltration, which is a common malicious activity aimed at stealing system information without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because running a script during installation without visible output can be used to execute malicious code silently. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the use of a hidden preinstall script is a common tactic in malicious packages."
