      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It searches for installed Discord client directories on the victim's machine, locates specific Discord core module files, and overwrites them with a remote JavaScript payload fetched from a GitHub URL. The payload URL and webhook URL are hardcoded or templated, indicating data exfiltration or control via a Discord webhook. The code also attempts to kill running Discord processes and restart them to ensure the injected code runs. Additionally, it tampers with BetterDiscord's asar file to replace webhook API endpoints, likely to hijack webhook communications. The overall behavior is consistent with malware designed to inject malicious code into Discord clients to steal information or perform unauthorized actions, commonly known as a Discord stealer or injector."
