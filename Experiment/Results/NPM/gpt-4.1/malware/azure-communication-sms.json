      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces and IP addresses, DNS servers, package information, and encodes this data. It then sends this information to an external server (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com) via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request. The use of a suspicious domain (interactsh.com is commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing but can be abused) and the collection of sensitive environment details without user consent indicates data exfiltration behavior. This is characteristic of spyware or reconnaissance malware that gathers environment data and sends it to a remote attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate reason for a typical package to perform such extensive environment fingerprinting and external communication, especially to an unknown domain."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
