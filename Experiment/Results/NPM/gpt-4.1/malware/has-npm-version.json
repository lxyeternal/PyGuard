It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive details about the user's environment and filesystem. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data, which could be used for data exfiltration or command and control signaling. The presence of multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or analysis environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."
