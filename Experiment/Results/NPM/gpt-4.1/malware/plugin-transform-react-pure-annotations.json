      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root-level and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from the collected data, which can be used for covert data exfiltration or command and control signaling. The presence of multiple hostname and path checks to exclude certain environments suggests attempts to evade detection or analysis. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation without any tests or clear purpose. The 'index.js' file is not provided, so its contents are unknown, but running code at preinstall stage is a common vector for malicious behavior such as installing backdoors, stealing credentials, or modifying the environment. Additionally, the package name and version appear unusual and the description is vague ('azure package'), which can be a tactic to disguise malicious intent."
