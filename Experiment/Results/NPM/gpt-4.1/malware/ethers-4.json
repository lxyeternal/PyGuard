This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package name 'ethers-4' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to the official 'ethers' package, suggesting it might be a typosquatting attempt to trick users into installing a malicious package. The 'index.js' file executed in 'preinstall' is not provided, so its contents are unknown, but running code at preinstall is a common vector for malicious behavior."
