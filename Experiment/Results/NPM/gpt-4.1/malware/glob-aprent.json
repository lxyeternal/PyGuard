After the download completes, it immediately executes this file using child_process.exec. The '.lnk' extension typically indicates a Windows shortcut file, which can be used to execute arbitrary commands or launch malicious payloads. Automatically downloading and executing a file from an external source without validation or user consent is a common vector for malware distribution and can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system."

Running arbitrary code during preinstall is a common vector for malicious behavior, especially if the 'index.js' file contains code that could execute harmful actions. Since the 'preinstall' script executes code before the package is fully installed, it can potentially run malicious code on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', this is suspicious and potentially malicious."
