It includes dynamic function generation via the Function constructor, string decoding routines, and runtime evaluation of code. Such patterns are typical of malicious scripts attempting to evade detection. The code also appears to perform checks and manipulations on the environment, possibly to detect debugging or sandboxing, and then executes dynamically generated code. These behaviors strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden or unauthorized actions, which is characteristic of malware or malicious payloads."
