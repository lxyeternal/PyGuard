      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious behavior. It collects system information such as OS type and hostname, executes shell commands synchronously, reads its own source code, and sends this collected data via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server. Additionally, it performs DNS lookups on the target URL and logs or processes the responses. The code also appears to execute dynamically constructed functions and may attempt to evade detection by obfuscation and self-inspection. These behaviors are consistent with data exfiltration and potential remote command execution, which are typical characteristics of malware or backdoor scripts."
