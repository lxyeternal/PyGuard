It also collects network interface IP addresses. This information is then encoded and exfiltrated by performing DNS lookups to dynamically constructed subdomains under the domain '.ex.neversummer.xyz'. This technique is commonly used for data exfiltration via DNS tunneling, which can bypass many network security controls. The code does not perform any legitimate DNS resolution purpose but uses DNS queries as a covert channel to send sensitive system information to a remote server, which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package name '@xvideos/alerts' is suspicious because it uses the name of a well-known adult website, which is a common tactic to trick users into installing malicious packages. The presence of a 'preinstall' script running 'node build-project.js' is concerning because it executes code before installation, which can be used to run arbitrary or harmful code on the user's system. Without the content of 'build-project.js', it is impossible to verify the safety of this script, but combined with the suspicious package name, this strongly indicates potential malicious intent."
