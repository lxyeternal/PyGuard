      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root-level and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from the collected data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and reconnaissance typical of malicious spyware or backdoor code."
