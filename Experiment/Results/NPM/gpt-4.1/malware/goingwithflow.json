It then sends all this collected information via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (eoyepq82deghwp1.m.pipedream.net). This behavior constitutes data exfiltration of potentially sensitive information without user consent, which is considered malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but such scripts are commonly used to run malicious code or compromise the environment. Additionally, the description mentions a 'dependency confiuse vulnerability,' which may indicate the package is designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. Overall, the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a red flag for potential malicious behavior."
