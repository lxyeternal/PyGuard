It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (en47d1uz958z2v9.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party endpoint often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and project information to an external party."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious payloads or compromise the environment. Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and a common vector for malicious activity."
