It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which could be used for command and control or tracking. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-destructuring' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to any known official package, and the description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated. The author field is empty, and the license field is incorrectly capitalized as 'License' instead of 'license', which may indicate a hastily created or malicious package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
