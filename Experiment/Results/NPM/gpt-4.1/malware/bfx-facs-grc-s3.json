It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection in security testing or potentially for data exfiltration. The code also attempts to enumerate files on common drives (commented out), indicating potential intent to gather more data. This behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it silently collects and transmits sensitive environment and user information without user consent."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and often associated with malicious packages."
