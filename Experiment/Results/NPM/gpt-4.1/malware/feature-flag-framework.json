It then converts this collected data into a hex string and sends it via an HTTP POST request to an external URL (https://eozpdddh3tifjo.m.pipedream.net). This behavior constitutes data exfiltration, which is malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive information to an unauthorized third party without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package is named 'feature-flag-framework' with a very high version number '9.999.0' and a description explicitly stating it is a 'proof of concept for dependency confusion'. The 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because it can execute arbitrary code during installation without the user's knowledge. The combination of a misleading package name, a high version number, and a hidden preinstall script strongly indicates malicious intent related to dependency confusion attacks."
