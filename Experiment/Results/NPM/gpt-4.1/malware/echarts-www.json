      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including environment variables, current working directory, OS details, CPU info, network interfaces (excluding loopback and localhost), memory info, and user info. It then compresses and encodes this data. The code also disables the Node.js environment variable NODE_NO_EVAl by setting it to undefined, which is a protection mechanism against eval usage. Finally, it executes an eval on a decompressed and decoded string. The use of eval on an obfuscated and compressed payload is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it can execute arbitrary code hidden from immediate view. The payload is not visible in plain text, making it suspicious and potentially dangerous. This pattern is typical of malware or backdoor code that exfiltrates system information and executes hidden commands."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json references scripts named 'init.js' and 'rsh.js' inside a 'scripts' folder, which are included in the published files. The 'test' and 'init' scripts both execute 'init.js', with the 'test' script running it in the background. The repository URL points to 'hktalent/rshNpm', and the author is '51pwn', which are suspicious names often associated with hacking or exploitation. The presence of a script named 'rsh.js' (commonly shorthand for 'remote shell') suggests potential backdoor or remote shell functionality. Without the actual script contents, the naming and setup strongly indicate malicious intent, likely to execute unauthorized code or establish remote access when the package is installed or tested."
