It also creates a file in /tmp with a specific message. Then, it sends all this collected information, including the system info and file content, to a remote Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration and privacy violation, which is malicious. The use of exec to run multiple system commands and the transmission of potentially sensitive data to an external server without user consent is a clear indicator of malicious intent."
