It then writes this information to a temporary file, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to an external URL (http://lulshdazpypdagyixvqzasm9jt0fgtv0n.oast.fun). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, which is a common malicious activity aimed at stealing system information without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js > /dev/null 2>&1', which executes a JavaScript file silently during installation. This is a common vector for malicious code execution. Additionally, the dependencies include suspiciously named packages such as 'proxyapi-docs', 'vpro-dhhvc' (which is the same as the package name, potentially a self-dependency), and 'vrt_hitlijst_generic_voting' with unusual version numbers (1.999.0), which are not standard or well-known packages. These factors combined suggest potential malicious behavior or at least suspicious activity that warrants further investigation."
