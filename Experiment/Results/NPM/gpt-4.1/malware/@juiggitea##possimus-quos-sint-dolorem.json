      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares an unusually large number of dependencies with suspiciously obfuscated and nonsensical package names, all scoped under uncommon or seemingly random namespaces such as '@firantea', '@juiggitea', '@npmteasources', and '@womhla6stea'. This pattern is typical of malicious or typosquatting packages designed to evade detection. The dependencies are all pinned to version '^1.0.0' but the package names do not correspond to any known or reputable libraries. There are no scripts defined beyond a placeholder test script, which is common in malicious packages to avoid raising suspicion. The repository URL points to a GitHub repository under the same suspicious namespace, which may or may not be legitimate. Overall, the combination of many obscure dependencies with random names and no meaningful scripts strongly suggests this package is part of a malicious supply chain attack or a malware distribution attempt."
