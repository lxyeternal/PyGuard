This behavior is suspicious because it causes the package installation process to make an outbound network request to a potentially attacker-controlled domain (oastify.com is commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing). This can lead to information leakage about the host machine or be used as part of a dependency confusion or supply chain attack."
