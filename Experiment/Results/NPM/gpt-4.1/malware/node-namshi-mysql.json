      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com). The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration or telemetry backdoor. The code also attempts to gather file paths from common drive letters (commented out) which could be used to further enumerate the system. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious spyware or backdoor functionality designed to stealthily leak sensitive environment and system data to an attacker-controlled server."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
