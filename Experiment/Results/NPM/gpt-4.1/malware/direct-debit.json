This domain does not appear to be a legitimate or well-known service and could be controlled by an attacker. The code checks if the response status is 200 and logs a success message, which suggests it is verifying if the host machine is authorized or reachable by the remote server. This behavior is typical of backdoors or malware that perform a 'phone home' operation to a command and control server. The use of a seemingly random package name and a non-standard domain strongly indicates potential malicious intent, such as unauthorized data exfiltration, remote control, or tracking of infected machines."
