It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and unauthorized telemetry collection, which is considered malicious as it compromises user privacy and system security."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but such scripts are commonly used to run malicious code, steal data, or modify the environment. Additionally, the package name and description ('plugin-syntax-typescript' and 'azure package') do not align clearly, which may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package."
