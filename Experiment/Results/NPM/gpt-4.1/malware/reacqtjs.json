      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during installation, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'reacqtjs' and repository URL 'https://github.com/serialfuzzer/AngulerJS.git' appear to be typos or lookalikes of popular packages (React and AngularJS), which is a common tactic in dependency confusion or typosquatting attacks. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further suggests this package is designed to exploit such attacks. Without the content of 'new.js', the exact malicious payload cannot be confirmed, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior."
