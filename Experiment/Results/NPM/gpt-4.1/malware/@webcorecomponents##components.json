It then encodes this information in hexadecimal and exfiltrates it by sending DNS queries to a domain controlled by the attacker (oastify.com subdomain). This technique of data exfiltration via DNS queries is a known covert channel used to bypass network monitoring and data loss prevention systems. The code is designed to stealthily leak sensitive environment information to an external attacker-controlled server without the user's consent, which constitutes malicious behavior."
