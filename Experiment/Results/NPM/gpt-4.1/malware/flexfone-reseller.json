It then sends all this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external, suspicious-looking domain (nzqsznocud9iy7nwplpa96wq8he82zqo.oastify.com). This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, which is malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive system information to an unknown third party without user consent."
