It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration and telemetry gathering that can be used for fingerprinting or tracking the host machine. The code attempts to exclude certain known hostnames or paths from sending data, possibly to evade detection or avoid sending data from specific environments. Overall, this constitutes malicious behavior as it covertly collects and transmits potentially sensitive system information to a remote server."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package has an unusually high version number (99.10.9) and a vague description ('azure package') with no author information, which are common signs of a potentially malicious or untrustworthy package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a red flag."
