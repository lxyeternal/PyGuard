      "malicious_behavior": "The code is obfuscated and performs unauthorized modifications to Discord client files. It scans the user's local Discord installation directories, searches for specific files, and overwrites them with modified content fetched from a remote HTTPS source. The injected content includes multiple webhook URLs, which are likely used to exfiltrate user data or send stolen information to an attacker-controlled server. The code also executes system commands to list running Discord processes and triggers the infection routine. Additionally, it sends notifications to a webhook about the injection status. This behavior is characteristic of malware designed to compromise Discord clients, steal information, or hijack user sessions."
