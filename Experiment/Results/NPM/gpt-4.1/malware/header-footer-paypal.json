      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means that any code inside index.js will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, downloading malware, or stealing information. Without inspecting index.js, the presence of a preinstall script running arbitrary code is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially given the unusual version number and the description referencing a 'Paypal Bug bounty program test', which could be a social engineering lure."
