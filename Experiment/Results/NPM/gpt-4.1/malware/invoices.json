This behavior can be used for unauthorized data exfiltration, command and control communication, or to verify if the environment is authorized. The domain and package name appear suspicious and are not standard or well-known, which is a common trait in malicious packages. Although the code itself does not explicitly perform harmful actions like data theft or code execution, the network call to an external, potentially untrusted server without user consent is a red flag and can be considered malicious behavior."
