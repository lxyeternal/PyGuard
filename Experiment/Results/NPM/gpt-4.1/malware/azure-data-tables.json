It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing or potentially for data exfiltration. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) which could be used for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it silently gathers and transmits sensitive environment and system data to a remote server without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'azure-data-tables' with a very high version number '99.10.9' and a vague description 'azure whitehat package' without an author or proper license raises concerns about legitimacy. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
