It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction and potentially for exfiltration or command-and-control. The code also attempts to enumerate files from certain drives (commented out) which could be used for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and telemetry collection without user consent, which is considered malicious."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'azure-search-documents' with a very high version number and the description 'azure whitehat package' could be an attempt to impersonate a legitimate Azure package, which is a common tactic in malicious packages. The lack of author information and the presence of a preinstall script without clear purpose increases suspicion."
