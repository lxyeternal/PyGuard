It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it gathers and transmits private system information without user consent. The presence of multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or analysis environments."
