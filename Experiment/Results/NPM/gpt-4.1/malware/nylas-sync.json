This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Since the 'index.js' file is not provided, its contents are unknown, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior in npm packages."
