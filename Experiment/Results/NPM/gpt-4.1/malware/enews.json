This technique is commonly used to obfuscate malicious payloads and evade detection. Since the actual payload is hidden inside the encoded string and executed dynamically, it could perform any harmful actions such as executing arbitrary commands, stealing data, or modifying the system. Without fully decoding and analyzing the embedded script, the behavior is suspicious and indicative of malicious intent."
