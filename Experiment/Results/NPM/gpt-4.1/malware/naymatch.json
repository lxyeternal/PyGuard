After the download completes, it immediately executes this file using 'child_process.exec'. The '.lnk' extension indicates a Windows shortcut file, which can be used to execute arbitrary commands or programs. Automatically downloading and executing a file from an external source without any validation or user consent is a common vector for malware distribution and can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system. Therefore, this behavior is malicious."
