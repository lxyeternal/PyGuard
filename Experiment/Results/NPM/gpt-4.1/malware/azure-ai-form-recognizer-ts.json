It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection in security testing or potentially for data exfiltration. The code performs DNS lookups on crafted subdomains containing encoded system data and sends the collected data to the external server without user consent. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and reconnaissance, which is malicious."
