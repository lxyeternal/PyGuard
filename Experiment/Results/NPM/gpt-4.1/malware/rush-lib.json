It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it gathers sensitive environment details and transmits them to a remote server, potentially compromising user privacy and security."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Since the 'index.js' file is not provided, its contents are unknown, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
