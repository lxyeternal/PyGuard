The filename 'nbflkny.js' appears obfuscated or randomly named, which is a common tactic to hide malicious code. Running arbitrary JavaScript during preinstall can execute any code on the user's machine without their explicit consent. Without the actual content of 'nbflkny.js', it is impossible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of an obfuscated script executed during preinstall is highly suspicious and a common vector for malware or unwanted code execution."
