It then encodes this information in hex, processes it, and performs DNS lookups to a suspicious external domain (oastify.com), which is commonly used for out-of-band data exfiltration and testing. This behavior indicates an attempt to stealthily gather and exfiltrate system information to an external server, which is malicious."

Additionally, the 'install' script runs 'node extract.js' upon installation, but the content of 'extract.js' is not provided. This script could execute arbitrary code during installation, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. The description states it is a proof of concept to confirm installation on victim machines, implying it is designed to detect or track installations, which can be considered malicious or at least suspicious behavior."
