While the code itself only downloads and saves the file without executing it, the downloaded file is a shell script which could potentially contain malicious commands. This behavior is suspicious because downloading executable scripts from an external source without validation can be used to facilitate malicious activities such as running unauthorized commands or malware. Therefore, the code poses a security risk depending on how the downloaded script is used afterward."

      "malicious_behavior": "The 'preinstall' script runs 'node index.js' before installation, which can execute arbitrary code. Additionally, it changes permissions of 'exps.sh' to 777 (full read/write/execute for all users), which is suspicious and potentially dangerous. The script then lists directory contents with 'ls'. The combination of executing a script before install and setting wide permissions on a shell script is a common pattern in malicious packages to execute unauthorized code or escalate privileges."
