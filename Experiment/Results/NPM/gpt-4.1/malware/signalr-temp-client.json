It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (a pipedream.net endpoint), which is a third-party service often used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information to an external entity."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that collects sensitive system information such as the hostname, current working directory, and the current user. It then sends a request to an external URL (https://vg8ubk.dnslog.cn) using curl, which can be used to exfiltrate data or confirm the presence of the system to a remote attacker. Additionally, it performs DNS lookups to the same external domain, which can be used for covert signaling or data exfiltration. This behavior indicates potential reconnaissance and data leakage to an attacker-controlled server, which is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node adham.js' before installation. This means that any code inside 'adham.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, downloading malware, or compromising the system. Without the content of 'adham.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom JavaScript file is suspicious and often used in malicious packages."
