      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package has an unusually high version number (99.10.9) and minimal metadata, which can be indicators of a potentially malicious or spoofed package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a red flag."
