It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain name (a subdomain of oast.pro, which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing and can be used for data exfiltration). This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, which is malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information to an attacker-controlled server without user consent."
