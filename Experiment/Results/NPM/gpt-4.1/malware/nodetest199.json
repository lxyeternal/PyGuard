It spawns a system shell (cmd on Windows or /bin/sh on Unix-like systems) and pipes the shell's input and output streams to the network socket, effectively allowing the remote server to execute arbitrary commands on the infected machine. The code also attempts to reconnect up to 10 times if the connection fails, indicating persistence. This behavior is characteristic of backdoor or remote access trojan (RAT) malware."
