      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares an unusually large number of dependencies, all with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The naming pattern suggests these packages are likely fabricated or part of a dependency confusion or supply chain attack. There are no scripts defined beyond a trivial test script, which is suspicious given the volume of dependencies. This pattern is typical of malicious packages designed to inject malicious code through transitive dependencies or to confuse users and automated scanners. Without further code inspection, the presence of so many suspicious dependencies strongly indicates malicious intent or at least a high risk of malicious behavior."
