Such obfuscation is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. The code dynamically constructs and executes code at runtime (e.g., via Function constructors and eval-like behavior), which is a strong indicator of potentially harmful actions. Although the exact payload is not trivially extractable due to obfuscation, the presence of dynamic code execution, string manipulations to reconstruct code, and attempts to evade detection strongly suggest that this code is malicious. It may perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, injecting further malicious scripts, or compromising the host environment."
