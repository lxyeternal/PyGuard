It then sends all this collected data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (eor6wmkkuv9bixi.m.pipedream.net), which is likely controlled by an attacker or unauthorized third party. Additionally, commented-out code snippets indicate potential for establishing reverse shells, which are commonly used for unauthorized remote access. Collecting and exfiltrating system information without user consent is considered malicious behavior."
