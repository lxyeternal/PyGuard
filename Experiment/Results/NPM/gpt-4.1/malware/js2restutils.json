It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (vxwd9hkn0h2baw8stqh3z0u01r7iv8jx.oastify.com), which is a suspicious domain often used for out-of-band interaction testing (similar to burpcollaborator.net). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious."

This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized code, stealing environment data, or installing backdoors. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious."
