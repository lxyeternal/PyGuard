It then sends all this potentially sensitive data via an HTTPS POST request to an external endpoint (fb40d252f3831c4553eb428e5620a2a0.m.pipedream.net), which is a third-party service often used for capturing webhooks or data. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, which is a form of malicious activity as it leaks potentially sensitive system information without user consent."
