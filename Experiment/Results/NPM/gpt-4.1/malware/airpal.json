It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggnsdwfyyyyyyn.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection in security testing but can also be abused for data exfiltration. The data collection and exfiltration occur without user consent or notification, indicating potential spyware or telemetry behavior designed to leak sensitive environment details to a remote server. This behavior is characteristic of malicious or at least privacy-invasive code."
