It encodes this data and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com). The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and sometimes by malware for command and control or data exfiltration, indicates potential data exfiltration. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) and network interfaces, which could be used for reconnaissance. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious telemetry or data exfiltration malware."
