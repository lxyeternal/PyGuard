This script executes the 'index.js' file silently before installation, suppressing all output and errors. This behavior is suspicious because it can be used to run arbitrary or malicious code during installation without the user's knowledge. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this silent execution is a red flag for potential malicious activity."
