      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces and IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection in security testing but can also be abused for data exfiltration. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) and encodes path information. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and reconnaissance typical of malicious or spyware code."
