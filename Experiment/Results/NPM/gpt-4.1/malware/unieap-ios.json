      "malicious_behavior": "The code forks a detached child process running the script 'scripts/rsh.js' and then immediately exits the parent process. Running a detached child process allows it to continue executing independently in the background, which can be used to hide malicious activities. Without knowing the contents of 'scripts/rsh.js', this pattern is suspicious because it can be used to spawn hidden background processes that perform unauthorized actions, evade detection, or maintain persistence."

      "file_type": "js",
      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including environment variables, OS details, CPU info, network interfaces (excluding loopback), current working directory, user info, memory stats, and package.json metadata. It then compresses and encodes this data. The critical malicious behavior is that it disables Node.js's NODE_NO_EVAl environment variable (which normally can disable eval) by setting it to undefined, and then executes a large base64-encoded, Brotli-compressed string via eval. This obfuscated payload is hidden and executed at runtime, which is a common technique used to conceal malicious code. The presence of eval on decoded, compressed, and encoded data strongly indicates malicious intent such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or backdoor installation."

      "relative_path": "package.json",
      "file_type": "package.json",
      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines multiple lifecycle scripts (preinstall, postinstall, test, init) that all execute the same script: './scripts/init.js' in the background. This is suspicious because running scripts during install phases can be used to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine without explicit consent. Additionally, the presence of another script file './scripts/rsh.js' and the repository URL 'git+ssh://git@github.com/hktalent/rshNpm.git' with the author '51pwn' (which hints at exploitation or hacking) further raises suspicion. The scripts are run asynchronously (with '&'), which can be used to hide or obfuscate malicious activity. Without the actual content of 'init.js' and 'rsh.js', it is impossible to definitively say what the scripts do, but the setup strongly suggests potential malicious behavior such as remote shell access or unauthorized code execution."
