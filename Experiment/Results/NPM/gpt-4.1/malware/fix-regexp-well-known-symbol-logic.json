      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root-level and drive-level paths (e.g., C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from the collected data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it stealthily gathers and transmits system information without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'fix-regexp-well-known-symbol-logic' and version '99.10.9' appear unusual and may be attempting to impersonate a legitimate package. The 'index.js' file executed in 'preinstall' is not provided, so its contents are unknown, but the presence of a preinstall script running custom code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
