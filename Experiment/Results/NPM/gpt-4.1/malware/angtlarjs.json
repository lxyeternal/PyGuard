      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'angtlarjs' is similar to 'angularjs', and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be attempting a dependency confusion attack, where a malicious package is published with a name similar to a popular package to trick users or automated systems into installing it. Without the content of 'new.js', the exact malicious actions cannot be confirmed, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom JS file is a strong indicator of potential malicious behavior."
