This behavior is suspicious because it attempts to make an HTTP request during the installation phase, which can be used to exfiltrate data, trigger remote code execution, or perform other malicious actions. The domain appears to be a non-standard, likely attacker-controlled domain, and the use of the '-e' flag with curl is unusual and may be intended to send a referer header or similar. Overall, this script indicates potentially malicious behavior."
