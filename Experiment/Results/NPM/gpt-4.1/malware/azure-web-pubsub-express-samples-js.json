It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent or notification. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and unauthorized telemetry collection, which is considered malicious as it compromises user privacy and system security."
