It also manipulates the global 'console' object methods (log, warn, error, info) by wrapping or overriding them, which is a common tactic to hide or alter logging behavior. The code dynamically requires a module with a path constructed from obfuscated strings and then calls a method on it with a suspicious script path ('scripts/in' + obfuscated suffix). These behaviors—obfuscation, tampering with built-in prototypes, dynamic code execution, and loading external scripts—are typical indicators of malicious intent, such as hiding malicious payloads, intercepting or suppressing logs, or executing unauthorized code. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated, using techniques such as encoded string arrays, self-invoking functions, and complex control flow to hide its true intent. It dynamically requires the 'child_process' module and calls the 'fork' method with a script path ('scripts/rs' + 'h.js'), launching a detached child process. This behavior is suspicious because it spawns a separate process without clear legitimate purpose, potentially to run hidden or unauthorized code in the background. The obfuscation and use of detached child processes are common tactics in malicious scripts to evade detection and maintain persistence. Therefore, the code likely contains malicious behavior related to covert process spawning and execution of hidden scripts."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of string encoding and function indirection to hide its true behavior. Key points indicating malicious behavior include:\n\n1. The code reads the contents of a directory named './node_modules' (or similar) and counts files that are either regular files or symbolic links.\n2. It collects extensive system information using the 'os' module, including platform, architecture, release, uptime, hostname, CPU details, network interfaces (filtered to exclude certain types), free and total memory, and user info.\n3. It serializes this system information into JSON, compresses it using Brotli compression with specific parameters, and then encodes it in base64.\n4. It constructs a string (variable 's1') that appears to be a large, obfuscated payload, which is then executed via 'eval' if the number of files in the node_modules directory exceeds a certain threshold.\n5. The use of 'eval' on dynamically generated and compressed data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of arbitrary code.\n6. The obfuscation and anti-debugging techniques (such as redefining console methods to no-ops) further suggest an attempt to evade detection.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to collect sensitive system information and conditionally execute hidden code, which is characteristic of malware or spyware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node ./index.js &' which executes the index.js file in the background before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads without user consent. Additionally, the description states it is for 'security penetration testing verification,' which may indicate it is intended for testing exploits or vulnerabilities. Without the content of index.js, it is impossible to fully assess, but the presence of a background node process during preinstall is a common vector for malicious behavior."
