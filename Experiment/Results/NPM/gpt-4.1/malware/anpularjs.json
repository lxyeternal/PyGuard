      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'anpularjs' is similar to the popular 'angularjs' package, and the repository URL points to a suspicious GitHub repository named 'AngulerJS' by 'serialfuzzer', which may indicate an attempt at dependency confusion or typosquatting. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further suggests this package is designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks."
