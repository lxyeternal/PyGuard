It then encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from system data. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it gathers and transmits private system information without user consent. The presence of multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or analysis environments."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'free-solid-svg-icons' and description 'azure package' do not align, which may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package. The absence of author information and the unusual version number '99.10.9' further raise suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
