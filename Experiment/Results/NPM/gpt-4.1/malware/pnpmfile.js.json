      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from the collected data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it silently gathers and transmits system data without user consent."
