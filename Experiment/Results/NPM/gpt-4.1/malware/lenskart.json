It then sends all this collected data, including the shell command output, to an external server (eo2z7l1ydft6861.m.pipedream.net) over HTTPS. This behavior is indicative of reconnaissance and unauthorized remote access attempts, which are malicious activities."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process. Since the content of 'index.js' is not provided, this behavior is suspicious because it can be used to execute arbitrary or malicious code without the user's explicit consent. The presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a common vector for malicious activity in npm packages."
