It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing or potentially for data exfiltration. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) which could be used for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with spyware or a backdoor attempting to fingerprint the host and exfiltrate sensitive environment data without user consent."
