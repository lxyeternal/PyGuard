More critically, it decrypts the 'code' field and executes it using eval(). Executing decrypted code from an external file is a significant security risk, as it can run arbitrary and potentially harmful code on the system without any validation or sandboxing. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code loaders or droppers that hide their payload in encrypted form and execute it dynamically."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node install.js' before installation. This script can execute arbitrary code during the installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the version number '900.9.9' is unusually high and the description 'For use by FireEye only.' is suspicious, possibly indicating a targeted or disguised package. Without the content of 'install.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom JS file is a red flag for potential malicious activity."
