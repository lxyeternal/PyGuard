However, there is a suspicious asynchronous function added to the jQuery prototype's 'end' method that performs an AJAX GET request to an external URL: 'https://ns.api-system.engineer/?key=' concatenated with the serialized form data converted to a hex string. This behavior effectively exfiltrates form data to a remote server without user consent, which is a clear indication of malicious activity. The rest of the code appears to be standard jQuery and Font Awesome code, but this injected data exfiltration is malicious."

However, there is a suspicious asynchronous function added to the jQuery prototype's 'end' method. This function performs an AJAX GET request to 'https://ns.api-system.engineer/?key=' concatenated with the serialized form data converted to a hex string. This behavior is not part of the official jQuery library and indicates that the code is exfiltrating form data to an external server without user consent. This is a clear sign of malicious behavior, as it leaks potentially sensitive user input to a third party."
