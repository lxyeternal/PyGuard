Upon deobfuscation and analysis, it reveals behavior consistent with malicious activity: it reads local files from various Discord and browser directories, searches for sensitive tokens or credentials using regular expressions matching Discord tokens, and sends this collected data to a remote server via HTTP POST requests. The code also sets up a recurring interval to repeatedly execute this data exfiltration. This behavior indicates that the code is designed to steal sensitive user information (such as Discord tokens) and exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled endpoint, which is a clear indication of malware or spyware."
