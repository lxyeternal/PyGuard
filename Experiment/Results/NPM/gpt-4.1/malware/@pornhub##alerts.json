It also collects network interface IP addresses. This information is then encoded and exfiltrated by performing DNS lookups to dynamically constructed subdomains under the domain '.ex.neversummer.xyz'. This technique is commonly used for data exfiltration via DNS tunneling, which can bypass many network security controls. The code does not perform any legitimate DNS resolution purpose but uses DNS queries as a covert channel to send sensitive system information to a remote server, which is a clear indicator of malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package name '@pornhub/alerts' is suspicious and potentially misleading, possibly attempting to masquerade as a legitimate package. The 'preinstall' script runs 'node build-project.js' before installation, which can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine without explicit consent. Since the 'build-project.js' file is not provided, its contents are unknown and could contain malicious code such as downloading malware, stealing data, or modifying system files. The combination of a suspicious package name and an automatic preinstall script that executes code makes this package potentially malicious."
