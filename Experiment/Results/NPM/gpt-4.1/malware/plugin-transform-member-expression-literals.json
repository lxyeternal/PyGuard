      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root-level and drive-level paths (e.g., C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from this data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with information gathering and exfiltration typical of spyware or backdoor malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json defines a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-member-expression-literals' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to known official packages, and the description 'azure package' is vague. The lack of author information and the presence of a preinstall script without any tests or other meaningful metadata increases suspicion that this package may attempt to execute malicious code during installation."
