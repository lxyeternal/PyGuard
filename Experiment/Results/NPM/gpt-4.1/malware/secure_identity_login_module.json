      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to connect to two hardcoded IP addresses on port 18393 as a health check. Upon successful connection, it collects system information (user info, platform, release, hostname), encodes it in base64, and sends it via a curl POST request to a URL constructed with the connected IP on port 8443. The response from this request is piped directly to /bin/sh, effectively executing remote code fetched from the server. Additionally, it runs a command to install an npm package '@ali/secure_identity_login_module' from the root directory. This behavior indicates remote code execution and unauthorized package installation triggered by external servers, which is characteristic of malicious backdoor or malware activity."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json runs a 'preinstall' script executing 'node load.js' before installation, which is a common vector for malicious code execution. Additionally, the 'config' field sets 'unsafe-perm' to true, allowing scripts to run with elevated permissions, increasing risk. Without the content of 'load.js', it is impossible to verify the exact behavior, but these factors combined are suspicious and often used in malicious packages to execute arbitrary code during installation."
