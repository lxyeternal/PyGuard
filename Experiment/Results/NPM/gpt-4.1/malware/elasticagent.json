It encodes this data and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggnsdwfyyyyyyn.interactsh.com), which is a known domain used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration in security testing and potentially malicious activities. The code performs DNS lookups on dynamically constructed subdomains containing encoded system data, effectively leaking sensitive environment information to a remote server without user consent. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or backdoor functionality aimed at covertly exfiltrating system and environment details."
