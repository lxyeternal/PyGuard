      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root-level and drive-level paths (e.g., C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on crafted domain names derived from the collected data, which could be used for covert data exfiltration or command and control signaling. The presence of multiple hostname and path checks to exclude certain environments suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in analysis/sandbox environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Since the content of 'index.js' is not provided, it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
