      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive details about the user's environment and filesystem. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data, which could be used for data exfiltration or command and control signaling. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to avoid detection or analysis in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or telemetry malware designed to stealthily gather and exfiltrate system information without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious payloads or compromise the system. Without reviewing the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
