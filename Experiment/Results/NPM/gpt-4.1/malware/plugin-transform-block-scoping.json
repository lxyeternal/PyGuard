      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths. It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes scanning directories such as C:\\, D:\\, /, and /home, which may expose sensitive file and directory information. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from system data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it stealthily gathers and transmits potentially sensitive system information to a remote server without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-block-scoping' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to known legitimate packages, and the description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated. The lack of author information and the presence of a preinstall script without clear purpose are red flags indicating potential malicious behavior."
