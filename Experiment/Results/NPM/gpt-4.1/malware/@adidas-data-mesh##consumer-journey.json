      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains an obfuscated payload encoded as a hex string, which is decoded and then executed via eval(). The decoded payload performs an HTTP GET request to 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json' to obtain the public IP address of the host machine. It then attempts to resolve the DNS for a suspicious domain 'u3y1r9bzg4917yssqicld2anler7v03p.oastify.com' using the 'dns.resolve4' method. The domain 'oastify.com' is known to be used for out-of-band interaction detection and can be used by attackers to verify if their code is running on a victim machine. The code also calls 'process.exit(1)' if an error occurs during DNS resolution, which can be used to terminate the process abruptly. The use of eval on decoded hex data, network calls to external domains, and DNS resolution to a suspicious domain strongly indicate malicious behavior, likely for reconnaissance or exfiltration purposes."
