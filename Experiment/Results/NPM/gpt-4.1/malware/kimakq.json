However, appended at the very end of the code is a jQuery snippet that hooks into all form submissions on the page: it serializes the form data and sends it via an AJAX GET request to the external URL 'https://patipride.icikipoxx.pw'. This behavior effectively exfiltrates form data (potentially including sensitive user input) to a remote server without user consent or notification. Such data exfiltration is a common malicious activity, indicating that this code contains hidden malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package declares a dependency on itself ('kimakq' version '^9.0.1'), which creates a circular dependency. This is suspicious and can cause issues during installation or runtime. Additionally, the 'main' field points to 'jquery.min.js', which is unusual for a package named 'kimakq' and may indicate an attempt to masquerade as a popular library. The package lacks meaningful metadata (empty author and description), and the test script is a placeholder. While no explicit malicious code is present in this package.json alone, the self-dependency and misleading main file suggest potentially malicious or at least suspicious intent."
