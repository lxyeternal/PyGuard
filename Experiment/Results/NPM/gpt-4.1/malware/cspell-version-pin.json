It encodes this information and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to an external domain (425a2.rt11.ml). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or telemetry without user consent. The code also attempts to gather file paths (commented out) which suggests potential for further data collection. Such unsolicited collection and transmission of sensitive system data to a remote server is considered malicious behavior."
