It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain name (ck3n4402vtc00000ycnggjt41nyyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is likely controlled by an attacker. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration and is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information without consent."

This means that before the package is installed, it will execute the 'index.js' file, which could contain arbitrary and potentially malicious code. Additionally, there are two 'preinstall' entries, but only the last one ('echo \"Hacker here....\"') will take effect due to JSON key overwriting, which is suspicious and may indicate an attempt to hide or confuse. The presence of a preinstall script that executes code is a common vector for malicious behavior in npm packages."
