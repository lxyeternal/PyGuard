After the download completes, it immediately executes this file using child_process.exec. Since '.lnk' files are Windows shortcut files, executing it can trigger arbitrary code execution on the host machine. This behavior is potentially malicious because it downloads and runs an external file without any validation or user consent, which can be used to deliver and execute malware."
