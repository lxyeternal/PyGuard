This behavior constitutes data exfiltration, which is a common malicious activity. Additionally, it writes a local file named 'locatethisfileforpoc' with the content 'execution achieved', which may be used as a marker or proof of execution. The combination of gathering sensitive system information and sending it to an external server without user consent indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious scripts that run 'node index.js --save-prod' during preinstall, postinstall, and start phases. Running arbitrary code during install scripts is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the presence of both 'request' and 'requests' dependencies is suspicious, especially since 'requests' is a less known package and could be malicious or a typo-squatting attempt. The version number '99.9.9' is unusually high, which can be a tactic to evade detection or mimic legitimate packages. Without the actual 'index.js' code, the exact malicious payload cannot be confirmed, but the setup strongly suggests potential malicious intent."
