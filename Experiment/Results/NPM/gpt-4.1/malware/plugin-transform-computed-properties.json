      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root-level and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive information about the user's environment and filesystem. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration purposes. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to avoid detection or analysis in specific environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to run malicious scripts without user consent. Additionally, the package name and version appear unusual and the description is vague ('azure package'), which can be a tactic to disguise malicious intent. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious code, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
