      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from system info before sending the data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it silently gathers and transmits private system information to a remote server without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation without any tests or clear purpose. The package name and description ('plugin-proposal-unicode-property-regex' and 'azure package') do not match, which is unusual and may indicate an attempt to disguise malicious intent. Additionally, the 'author' field is empty and the license field is incorrectly capitalized as 'License' instead of 'license', which are signs of a potentially unmaintained or malicious package. Running code during 'preinstall' can be exploited to execute malicious scripts on the user's machine."
