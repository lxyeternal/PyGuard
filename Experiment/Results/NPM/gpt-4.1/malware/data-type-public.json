This behavior is suspicious because it causes the system to make an outbound network request during installation, potentially leaking information about the environment or triggering a callback to an attacker-controlled server. Using canarytokens.com suggests it might be a honeypot or tracking mechanism, but in any case, executing arbitrary network commands in preinstall scripts is a common vector for malicious activity."
