It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data, which could be used for exfiltration or command-and-control signaling. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to perform malicious actions such as modifying files, stealing data, or installing malware. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
