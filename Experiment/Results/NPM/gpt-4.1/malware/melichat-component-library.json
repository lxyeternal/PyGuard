It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (ar5hdz0303710t4d9n2979k8bzhq5kt9.oastify.com), which is a suspicious domain often used for out-of-band interaction testing. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, which is malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information without consent."
