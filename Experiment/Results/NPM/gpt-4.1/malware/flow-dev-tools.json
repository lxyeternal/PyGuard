It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from this data. The presence of conditional checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance or data exfiltration typically seen in malicious or spyware code."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts or perform unwanted actions on the user's system. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
