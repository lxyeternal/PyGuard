      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the package name, current directory, home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, IP addresses, and package version. It encodes this information and sends DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is likely controlled by an attacker. The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration or command-and-control beaconing mechanism. The code also attempts to gather file listings from system drives (commented out), indicating potential for further reconnaissance. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious code designed to fingerprint the victim's environment and exfiltrate sensitive information covertly."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
