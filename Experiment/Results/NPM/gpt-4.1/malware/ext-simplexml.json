This means arbitrary JavaScript code in 'index.js' will execute automatically during installation, which is a common vector for malicious behavior. Without inspecting 'index.js', this setup is suspicious because it can run any code on the user's machine without explicit consent. Additionally, the package name and version are unusual ('ext-simplexml' with version '99.9.0'), and the author email 'savik@wearehackerone.com' may be an attempt to appear legitimate but could be misleading. Overall, the presence of a preinstall script running code is a red flag for potential malicious activity."
