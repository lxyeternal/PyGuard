It listens for 'exec:cmd' events from the server, executes the received shell commands on the local system using child_process.exec, and sends back the execution results (stdout, stderr, error) to the server via 'exec:result' events. This effectively creates a remote code execution backdoor, allowing the remote server to run arbitrary commands on the infected machine. Additionally, the code attempts to clean the local 'package.json' by removing install scripts and dependencies, and deletes a 'bundle.js' file, likely to remove traces or disable certain behaviors. These actions combined indicate malicious intent to gain remote control and hide its presence."
