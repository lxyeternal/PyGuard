      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from system info before sending the data. This behavior is consistent with information gathering and exfiltration typical of spyware or malware. There is no user consent or indication that this data collection is legitimate, and the external domain is suspicious and not a known trusted endpoint. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior by covertly harvesting and transmitting sensitive system information to a remote server."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package has an unusual version number '99.10.9' and minimal metadata, which are common signs of a potentially malicious or suspicious package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is not possible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a red flag."
