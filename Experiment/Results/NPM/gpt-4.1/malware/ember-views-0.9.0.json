This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is malicious. Additionally, the code writes a file named 'pocByKotko.txt' with a benign message, likely as a decoy or proof of concept, but the main concern is the covert transmission of system information to a remote server."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. Specifically, the 'preinstall' script runs 'npm i request --save-dev', which installs the 'request' package during the installation phase, potentially modifying the dependency tree unexpectedly. The 'postinstall' and 'test' scripts both run 'node index.js', which means arbitrary code in 'index.js' will execute automatically after installation and during testing. This is a common vector for malicious code execution. Additionally, the package incorrectly uses both 'Dependencies' (capitalized) and 'dependencies' (empty), which is non-standard and may be an attempt to confuse or bypass dependency checks. The inclusion of 'crypto', 'ip', 'os', and 'request' in both dependencies and devDependencies is unusual and may be an attempt to mask malicious intent. Overall, the automatic execution of 'index.js' during install and test phases is highly suspicious and could be used to run malicious code."
