      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root-level and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive details about the user's environment and filesystem. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration purposes. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to avoid detection or analysis in specific environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing code is a common vector for malicious behavior."
