      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that executes './exploit.sh' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary shell scripts during installation can lead to execution of malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the description mentions 'dependency confusion vuln', which suggests the package is intentionally crafted to exploit dependency confusion vulnerabilities. The combination of a preinstall script and the description strongly indicates malicious intent."
