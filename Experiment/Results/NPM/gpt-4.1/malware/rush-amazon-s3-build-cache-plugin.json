      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root-level and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive details about the user's environment and filesystem. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The presence of multiple checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or analysis environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase without any tests or clear purpose. The 'index.js' file is not provided, so its contents are unknown, but running code at preinstall can be used to execute malicious payloads or compromise the environment. Additionally, the package name mimics a legitimate plugin name ('rush-amazon-s3-build-cache-plugin'), which could be an attempt to deceive users."
