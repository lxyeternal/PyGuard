It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration and potential reconnaissance, which are common in malicious software. The code attempts to avoid running on certain hostnames or paths, possibly to evade detection or analysis environments. Overall, this is a form of spyware or telemetry malware that stealthily gathers and transmits sensitive environment data to a remote server."
