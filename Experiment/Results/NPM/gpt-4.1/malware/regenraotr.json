Specifically, it decodes a base64 string to get a domain name, performs a DNS lookup to get its IP address, then makes an HTTP GET request to 'http://<resolved_ip>/email'. The response is saved to '/tmp/rehearses', its permissions are set to be fully executable (0777), and then it is executed via child_process.exec. This behavior is characteristic of a backdoor or downloader malware that fetches and runs arbitrary code from a remote server without user consent."
