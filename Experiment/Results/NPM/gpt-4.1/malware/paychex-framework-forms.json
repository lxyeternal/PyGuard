It then sends all this potentially sensitive data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server at webhook.site, which is a known service for receiving and inspecting HTTP requests. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes suspicious dependencies: 'http' version '0.0.1-security', 'https' version '^1.0.0', and 'os' version '^0.1.1'. These are not the standard Node.js core modules but rather small, outdated, or placeholder packages that have been known to be used in malicious or typosquatting attacks. Additionally, the 'preinstall' script runs 'node preinstall.js' which could execute arbitrary code before installation, and without the source code of 'preinstall.js', this is a potential vector for malicious behavior. The combination of suspicious dependencies and a preinstall script is a red flag for malicious intent."
