      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, network interfaces IP addresses, DNS servers, and package metadata. It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com). The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation frameworks, suggests this is a data exfiltration mechanism. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out) which could be used for further data collection. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malicious telemetry or spyware designed to stealthily gather and exfiltrate sensitive environment and system data without user consent."
