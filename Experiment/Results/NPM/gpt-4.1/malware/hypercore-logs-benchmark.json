It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from system data. The data collection is extensive and includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and network configuration. The transmission of this data to a remote server indicates spyware or data exfiltration behavior, which is considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
