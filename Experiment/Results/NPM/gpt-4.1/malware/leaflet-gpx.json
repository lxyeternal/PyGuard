This appended code (_lyEX function and related helpers) attempts to hook into all forms on the page, especially those with password fields or fields named 'pwd' or 'password'. It attaches event listeners to form submissions to capture all form input values along with the current URL and document cookies. This data is then base64-encoded and sent to a remote URL constructed dynamically. The code also manipulates form actions to redirect form submissions to attacker-controlled URLs. Such behavior is characteristic of a form data stealer or credential harvester, which is malicious. The legitimate GPX parsing code is clean, but the appended obfuscated code is malicious."
