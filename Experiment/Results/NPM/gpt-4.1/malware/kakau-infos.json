      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to extract extensive personal and sensitive information from a Discord user account using their authorization token. It fetches user details, billing information, relationships (friends and blocks), guilds, applications (including bot tokens), connections, and even MFA backup codes if a password is provided. It also retrieves IP-related information if an IP is supplied. The function getBotToken extracts bot tokens associated with the user, which can be used maliciously. The code effectively acts as a Discord token stealer and information harvester, which is a common pattern in malicious scripts aimed at compromising Discord accounts and potentially abusing them. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
