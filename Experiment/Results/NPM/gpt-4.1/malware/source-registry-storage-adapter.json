It then sends all this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (https://clgt.cc/dependency-conf-npm.php) without user consent or notification. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration and can be considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive information about the user's environment and system to a third party."

This means that any code inside 'index.js' will be executed automatically during the package installation process, which is a common vector for malicious behavior such as running unauthorized scripts, downloading malware, or stealing information. Without inspecting 'index.js', this setup is suspicious and potentially malicious."
