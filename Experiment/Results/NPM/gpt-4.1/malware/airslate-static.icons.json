      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, home directory, current working directory, local IP address, package name and version, and a generated unique identifier (UID). It then encodes this information into a JSON string, converts it to hex, splits it into chunks, and exfiltrates the data by performing DNS queries to dynamically constructed subdomains under the domain 'pocbb.com'. This technique of data exfiltration via DNS queries is a known covert channel often used by malware to bypass network monitoring and firewalls. The code also includes checks to avoid running in certain environments (e.g., hostnames starting with 'DESKTOP-', or specific paths), which is typical of malware trying to evade detection in analysis or sandbox environments. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior by stealthily leaking sensitive system information to an external server using DNS requests."
