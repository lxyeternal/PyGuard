It sends the entire process environment variables (process.env) serialized as a JSON string, then base64 encoded, to this external server. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment variables, which is a common malicious activity. The obfuscation and the use of an external endpoint to send environment data strongly suggest this code is malicious."

The main file and the script file share the same unusual name 'ckmhtfk.js', which is non-descriptive and suspicious. Running arbitrary JavaScript code during the preinstall phase can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system without their knowledge. Without the actual content of 'ckmhtfk.js', it is impossible to definitively confirm malicious intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running an obscure JS file is a common tactic used in malicious packages."
