      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the package name, current directory, home directory, hostname, username, DNS servers, IP addresses, and package.json metadata. It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection in security testing and often abused by malware for data exfiltration or command and control. The code also attempts to enumerate files on certain drives (commented out), indicating potential for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration typical of malicious code."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the description 'bitfinex whitehat package' may be an attempt to appear trustworthy, but the lack of author information and tests further raises suspicion."
