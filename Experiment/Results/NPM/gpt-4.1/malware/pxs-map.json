It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain name (a long random-looking subdomain on oast.pro, a known domain used for out-of-band interaction testing). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or telemetry without user consent, which is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server."
