It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com). The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, suggests this is a data exfiltration or telemetry mechanism. The code also attempts to enumerate files on common drives (commented out) and sends potentially sensitive environment details without user consent. This behavior is consistent with malicious spyware or backdoor activity designed to fingerprint and exfiltrate system data covertly."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code during package installation, potentially leading to malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system compromise. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script running a custom script is a common vector for malicious behavior."
