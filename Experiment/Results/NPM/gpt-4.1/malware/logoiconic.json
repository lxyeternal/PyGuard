It includes dynamic function creation via the Function constructor, string decoding routines, and attempts to evade detection by manipulating function prototypes and using confusing variable names. The code also performs AJAX requests to external URLs, sending data collected from the page or environment, which is a common behavior in malicious scripts for data exfiltration or command and control communication. The obfuscation and network activity strongly indicate that this code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions, such as stealing information or injecting further malicious payloads."
