After the download completes, it immediately executes this file using child_process.exec. The '.lnk' extension indicates a Windows shortcut file, which can be used to execute arbitrary commands or programs. This behavior is potentially dangerous because it fetches and runs external code without any validation or user consent, which is a common pattern in malware or backdoor scripts."
