It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain '425a2.33mail.ga' on port 443. The data sent includes potentially sensitive details about the user's environment and filesystem. The code also performs DNS lookups on generated domain names based on the collected data, likely for tracking or exfiltration purposes. The obfuscation and the nature of data collection and exfiltration without user consent indicate malicious behavior consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."
