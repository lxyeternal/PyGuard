It then sends this information via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction and exfiltration in security testing and malware. The code also attempts to enumerate files on common drives (commented out) which suggests potential for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and telemetry gathering without user consent, indicating malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but running code at install time is a common vector for malicious behavior."
