      "malicious_behavior": "The code forks a detached child process running the script 'scripts/rsh.js' and then immediately exits the parent process. Running a detached child process allows it to continue executing independently in the background, which can be used to hide malicious activities. Without knowing the contents of 'scripts/rsh.js', this pattern is suspicious as it may be used to run unauthorized or hidden code without user awareness."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including environment variables, current working directory, OS details, CPU info, network interfaces (excluding loopback and localhost), memory info, and user info. It then compresses this data using Brotli compression and appears to decode and execute a large base64-encoded, Brotli-compressed payload via eval(). The use of eval() on decoded data from a hardcoded string is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it executes potentially obfuscated code without transparency. Additionally, the code disables NODE_NO_EVAl environment variable, which could be an attempt to bypass Node.js security restrictions against eval usage. Overall, this behavior is consistent with malware or spyware that gathers sensitive system data and executes hidden code, potentially for unauthorized data exfiltration or system compromise."

      "file_type": "package.json",
      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json references scripts located in the 'scripts' folder, specifically 'init.js' and 'rsh.js'. The 'test' and 'init' scripts both execute 'scripts/init.js', with the 'test' script running it in the background. The repository URL and author name ('51pwn') suggest a potential security researcher or attacker alias. The presence of a script named 'rsh.js' (commonly an abbreviation for 'remote shell') is suspicious and may indicate that the package attempts to establish a remote shell or backdoor. Additionally, the 'files' array explicitly excludes README.md, .npmignore, .github, .git, ps.sh, and node_modules, which is unusual and may be an attempt to hide certain files from the package contents. Without the actual script contents, the behavior cannot be fully confirmed, but these indicators strongly suggest malicious intent or at least suspicious behavior."
