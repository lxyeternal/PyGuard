It then converts this collected data into a hex string and sends it via an HTTP POST request to an external URL (https://eozpdddh3tifjo.m.pipedream.net). This behavior constitutes data exfiltration of potentially sensitive information to an unknown third party, which is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' and redirects all output to /dev/null, effectively hiding any output or errors. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts run automatically when the package is installed, and hiding output is a common tactic to conceal malicious activity. Additionally, the description states 'This is a proof of concept for dependency confusion,' which suggests the package is designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. Without seeing the contents of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively say what the script does, but the combination of a hidden preinstall script and the stated purpose strongly indicates malicious intent."
