It performs DNS lookups (using 'host') on subdomains constructed from the package name, the system's hostname, the current user, and the public IP address, all under the domain 'preben.work'. Additionally, it downloads data from 'http://preben.work/?wm-jquery' using 'wget' and discards the output. These actions indicate potential data exfiltration or tracking of the user's environment without consent, which is characteristic of malicious behavior."
