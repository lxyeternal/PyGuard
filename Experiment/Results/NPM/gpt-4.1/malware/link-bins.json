      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from the collected data, which could be used for covert data exfiltration or command and control signaling. The presence of multiple hostname and path checks to exclude certain environments suggests attempts to evade detection or analysis. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but running code at preinstall stage is a common vector for malicious behavior such as installing malware, stealing data, or modifying the system."
