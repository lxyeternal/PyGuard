It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from this data. The behavior of gathering extensive system and user environment data and exfiltrating it to a remote server without user consent is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package has no author information and a very high version number (99.10.9), which can be indicators of a potentially malicious or untrustworthy package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
