It first runs git commands to add all files, commit them with a prank message, and attempts to push the commit to the remote repository, potentially affecting the user's git history and remote repository. Then, it reads the current working directory, filters out hidden files and the 'node_modules' directory, and deletes all other files and directories recursively. This results in data loss by removing user files. Finally, it displays a prank message using figlet and gradient-string. Overall, the script performs unauthorized file deletion and unwanted git operations, which are malicious behaviors."
