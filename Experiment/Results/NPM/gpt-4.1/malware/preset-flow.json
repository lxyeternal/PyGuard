It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on system info, which can be used for tracking or exfiltration. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package has no author information and a misleading description ('azure package') that does not clarify its purpose, which are common signs of a potentially malicious or deceptive package."
