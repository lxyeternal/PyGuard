It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain name (ck385ge2vtc00008gwb0gjtwnaeyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is likely controlled by an attacker. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration and is considered malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive environment and user information without consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code during package installation, potentially leading to malicious behavior. Additionally, the dependency 'azuretestpackage' is not a known official package and could be malicious or a typo-squatting attempt. The combination of an unknown dependency and a preinstall script executing code makes this package potentially malicious."
