The code includes a self-invoking function that decodes and executes encoded payloads, making static analysis difficult. It accesses process environment variables and reads files from the filesystem, then processes and executes their contents. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution suggest attempts to hide malicious activities such as code injection, unauthorized file access, or execution of arbitrary code. The presence of suspicious patterns like decoding encoded strings, dynamic require calls, and manipulation of file permissions further indicate malicious behavior."
