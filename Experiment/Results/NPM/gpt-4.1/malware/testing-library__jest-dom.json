It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which can be used for tracking or exfiltration. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Additionally, the package name 'testing-library__jest-dom' mimics a well-known legitimate package but uses a double underscore instead of a single, which is a common tactic in typosquatting attacks. The version number '99.10.9' is unusually high and likely intended to appear more legitimate or recent. The description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated to the package name, which is suspicious. The combination of these factors suggests the package is designed to execute potentially malicious code during installation."
