It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from system data. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it gathers and transmits system information without clear user consent or legitimate purpose. The obfuscation via hex encoding and conditional checks to avoid certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or analysis."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-classes' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to known legitimate packages, and the description 'azure package' is vague. The lack of author information and the presence of a preinstall script are common indicators of potentially malicious behavior."
