It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation without any tests or clear purpose. The package name and description are generic and misleading ('helper-remap-async-to-generator' and 'azure package'), which can be an attempt to disguise malicious intent. The absence of author information and the unusual version number also raise concerns. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the exact behavior, but running code at preinstall is a common vector for malicious activity."
