This external request could be used to leak information about the environment where the code is running or to receive commands or data from a remote server. Such behavior is suspicious, especially since the URL is hardcoded and not related to any legitimate service. The rest of the code (the player function) appears benign, but the external HTTP request to a suspicious domain indicates potentially malicious behavior."

This is suspicious and can cause issues during installation or runtime. Additionally, the version number '69.69.69' is unusual and may indicate a placeholder or attempt to obfuscate. While no explicit malicious scripts or code are present, the self-dependency is a red flag that could be used to introduce malicious behavior or cause package manager failures."
