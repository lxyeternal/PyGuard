      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs a JavaScript file named '.pbk.js' with arguments. This script executes before installation, which is a common vector for malicious code execution. The presence of a 'preinstall' script running a potentially unknown or hidden file (note the dot prefix making it a hidden file) is suspicious. Additionally, the description 'Dependency Confusion POC' suggests this package may be designed to exploit dependency confusion vulnerabilities, which can be used to inject malicious code into projects that mistakenly install this package instead of an internal one. Without the content of '.pbk.js', it cannot be definitively stated what the script does, but the setup is indicative of potentially malicious behavior."
