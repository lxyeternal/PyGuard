      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, platform type, user info, and current working directory, then encrypts this data. It encodes the encrypted data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (https://kotko.me) with query parameters containing the encrypted system information. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration of potentially sensitive information without user consent, which is considered malicious. Additionally, the code writes a file named 'pocByKotko.txt' with a proof-of-concept message, which is less concerning but may indicate testing or proof of exploit."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. Specifically, the 'preinstall' script runs 'npm i request --save-dev', which installs the 'request' package during the installation phase, potentially modifying the dependency tree unexpectedly. The 'postinstall' and 'test' scripts both run 'node index.js', which could execute arbitrary code during installation and testing phases. Additionally, the 'Dependencies' field is incorrectly capitalized and the actual 'dependencies' field is empty, which is unusual and may be an attempt to confuse dependency management tools. The presence of 'request' (a deprecated package) and 'crypto' as dependencies is also suspicious, especially since 'crypto' and 'os' are core Node.js modules and should not be installed from npm. Overall, these factors suggest the package may execute unexpected code during installation and could be malicious."
