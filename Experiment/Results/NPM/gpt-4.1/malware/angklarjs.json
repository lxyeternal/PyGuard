This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'angklarjs' and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggest it might be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. Without the content of 'new.js', it is impossible to verify the exact behavior, but running a script at preinstall is a common vector for malicious activity."
