It concatenates this information, converts it to a hex string, extracts the first few characters, and then uses these characters to construct domain names to which it sends HTTP requests. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or command-and-control communication, potentially leaking system information to an external server (oast.fun domain). Such actions are typical of malicious code designed to gather reconnaissance data and communicate with an attacker-controlled server."

This behavior is highly suspicious and malicious as it allows the remote server to gain shell access to the machine running the npm install, potentially leading to unauthorized control, data theft, or further exploitation."
