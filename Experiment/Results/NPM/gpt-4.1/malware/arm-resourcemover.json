      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data collection includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from this data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it silently gathers and transmits private system information to a remote server without user consent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the installation process without any clear reason or safeguards. Since 'index.js' is the main entry point and is executed automatically during installation, it could potentially run malicious code or perform unwanted actions on the user's system. The lack of author information and minimal description further raise concerns about the package's trustworthiness."
