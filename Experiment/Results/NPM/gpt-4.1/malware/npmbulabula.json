      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding to hide its true functionality. After deobfuscation and analysis, the code collects detailed system information using the 'os' module, including architecture, endianness, free memory, home directory, hostname, load average, network interfaces, platform, release, temporary directory, total memory, system type, uptime, and package information. It then serializes this information into JSON, encrypts or encodes it (using a module 'x' which is required but not standard), and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server at 'api.jsjiami.com' on port 4628, path '/api/v1/collect'. The code also checks for certain conditions related to the hostname and exits the process if they are not met. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware, as it stealthily gathers sensitive system data and transmits it to a remote server without user consent. The use of obfuscation and the domain 'jsjiami.com' (a known JavaScript obfuscation service) further indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated, using multiple layers of encoding and string transformations to hide its true functionality. It imports the 'crypto' module and defines a function 'encryptM' that performs encryption operations using a hardcoded public key. The obfuscation and the presence of cryptographic operations with hardcoded keys suggest that the code is designed to conceal its behavior, which is a common trait of malicious scripts. Such code could be used to encrypt data stealthily, exfiltrate information, or perform unauthorized cryptographic operations. The obfuscation itself is suspicious and typically used to evade detection and analysis, indicating malicious intent."
