It encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain '425a2.33mail.ga' on port 443. The data sent includes potentially sensitive details about the user's environment and filesystem. The obfuscation and the nature of data exfiltration without user consent indicate malicious behavior consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."

Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is considered potentially malicious."
