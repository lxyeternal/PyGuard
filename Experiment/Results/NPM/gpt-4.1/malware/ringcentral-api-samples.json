It encodes this data and sends it via DNS lookups and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com), which is likely controlled by an attacker. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious. The use of interactsh.com, a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing and exploitation, further indicates that this code is designed to stealthily leak sensitive environment information to an external party."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because preinstall scripts can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine during package installation. Without inspecting the contents of 'index.js', this behavior is potentially malicious, especially since the package is named 'ringcentral-api-samples' but described as a 'bitfinex whitehat package', which is inconsistent and suspicious. The presence of a preinstall script running a node script is a common vector for malicious code execution."
