It constructs a hostname based on environment variables and sends system data such as process lists, kernel version, network info, and contents of sensitive files (/etc/hosts, /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow) encoded in base64 via curl POST requests to a suspicious domain (burpcollaborator.net). It also attempts to ping attacker-controlled domains. This behavior is indicative of reconnaissance and data exfiltration, which is malicious."
