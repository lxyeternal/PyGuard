      "malicious_behavior": "The code disables TLS certificate validation by setting NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED to 0, which is a security risk as it allows man-in-the-middle attacks. It then creates a hidden directory in the user's home directory named '.vscode' if it doesn't exist, and downloads data from an external URL ('https://npmrepos.com/checkupdate.php') using a synchronous HTTP GET request. The response body is saved to a file named 'jsontoken' inside the '.vscode' directory. This behavior is suspicious because it silently fetches and writes data from an external source into a hidden directory without user consent or clear purpose, which could be used to persist malicious payloads or exfiltrate data. The use of a legitimate-looking directory name to hide files and disabling TLS verification further indicate potentially malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'npm install sync-request' and then executes 'node main.js' before the package installation completes. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the 'sync-request' dependency allows synchronous HTTP requests, which could be used by 'main.js' to exfiltrate data or download further malicious code. Without the content of 'main.js', this behavior is potentially dangerous and indicative of malicious intent."
