It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server with a suspicious domain (a subdomain of oast.pro, which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing and can be used for data exfiltration). This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration, which is malicious as it leaks potentially sensitive information about the user's environment and project to a third party without consent."
