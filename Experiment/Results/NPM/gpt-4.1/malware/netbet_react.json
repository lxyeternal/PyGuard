It then sends this sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to an external server (http://u7obzgeb.requestrepo.com/). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, which is a common malicious activity. The code silently sends potentially private and identifying information without user consent or notification, which can be used for tracking, profiling, or further attacks."
