      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares a large number of dependencies with suspicious and nonsensical package names, all scoped under unusual and likely fabricated namespaces such as '@firantea', '@juiggitea', '@npmteasources', and '@womhla6stea'. These package names do not correspond to known or reputable packages and appear to be autogenerated or obfuscated. The sheer volume and pattern of these dependencies strongly suggest a supply chain attack or an attempt to hide malicious code within these dependencies. Additionally, there are no scripts or other metadata that would justify this many dependencies, and the repository URL points to a user-specific GitHub repository that may not be trustworthy. This pattern is typical of malicious packages designed to execute hidden malicious payloads when installed."
