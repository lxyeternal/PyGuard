It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction and potentially for exfiltration or command and control. The code also attempts to enumerate files from common drive letters (commented out but present), indicating potential reconnaissance. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and telemetry collection without user consent, which is considered malicious."
