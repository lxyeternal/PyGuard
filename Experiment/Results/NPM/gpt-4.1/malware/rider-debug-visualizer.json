It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggde77joyyyyyr.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction in security testing or exfiltration. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration or telemetry collection without user consent, which is considered malicious. The code also attempts to obfuscate the data by encoding it in hex and splitting it across DNS queries, a common technique to evade detection."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install process, which can be used to run malicious code without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package has no author information and an unusually high version number, which can be indicators of a potentially untrustworthy package. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the behavior, but the presence of a preinstall script running code is a common vector for malicious activity."
