It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (nkbs2o51otjl1mngnma6bievvm1dp2.oastify.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing (similar to Burp Collaborator or Interactsh). This behavior constitutes data exfiltration without user consent, which is considered malicious. The code silently suppresses errors and does not inform the user, further indicating malicious intent."

This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to confirm the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
