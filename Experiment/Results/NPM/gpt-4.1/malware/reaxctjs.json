      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'reaxctjs' is a misspelling of 'reactjs', and the repository URL points to a suspicious repository named 'AngulerJS' (a misspelling of 'AngularJS'), which are common tactics used in dependency confusion or typosquatting attacks. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' further suggests this package is designed to exploit such attacks. Without the content of 'new.js', it is impossible to definitively say what the script does, but the presence of a preinstall script running arbitrary code is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
