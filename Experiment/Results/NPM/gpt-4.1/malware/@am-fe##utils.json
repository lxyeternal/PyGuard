It also fetches the external IP address by querying an external service (https://ipinfo.io/json). Then, it packages all this collected data into a JSON object and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server at app.threatest.com on port 443, under the path /report/. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of potentially sensitive personal and system information, including private keys, which is a clear indicator of malicious intent."
