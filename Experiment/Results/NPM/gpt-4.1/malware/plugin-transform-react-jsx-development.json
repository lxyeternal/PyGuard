      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses, and directory listings from root and common drive paths (C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It encodes this data and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive information such as directory contents and user environment details. The code also performs DNS lookups on encoded queries derived from this data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration and reconnaissance typical of malicious spyware or backdoor code."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious scripts without the user's explicit consent. Additionally, the package name 'plugin-transform-react-jsx-development' and version '99.10.9' do not correspond to known official packages, and the description 'azure package' is vague and unrelated. The combination of an unusual preinstall script and vague metadata suggests potential malicious intent."
