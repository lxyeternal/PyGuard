Additionally, it writes a local file named 'locatethisfileforpoc' with the content 'execution achieved', which could be used as a marker or for persistence. The combination of gathering system info and sending it to an external server without user consent indicates malicious behavior related to data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains suspicious scripts that run 'node index.js --save-prod' during preinstall, postinstall, and start phases. Running arbitrary code during install scripts is a common vector for malicious behavior. Additionally, the presence of both 'request' and 'requests' dependencies is unusual; 'requests' is a less known package and could be malicious or a typo. The version number '99.9.9' is unusually high, which can be a tactic to avoid detection. Without the actual index.js code, the scripts running node index.js with '--save-prod' flag during install phases is highly suspicious and could execute malicious code on installation."
