It then sends this data via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (bs7zl9pd8ujs6fwhzvsoldl07rdi1cp1.oastify.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing (similar to Burp Collaborator). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or telemetry without user consent, which is considered malicious, especially if done covertly or without disclosure."
