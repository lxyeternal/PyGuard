These commands send system information such as the current username (via 'whoami'), the host IP address (via 'hostname -I'), and the hostname (via 'hostname') to an external URL (https://lykos.free.beeceptor.com). This behavior leaks potentially sensitive environment information to a third party without user consent, which is considered malicious. Additionally, the dependency on itself ('test_lykos') with a version range could cause unexpected behavior or dependency confusion."
