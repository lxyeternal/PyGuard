      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json declares an unusually large number of dependencies, all with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The naming pattern suggests these packages could be part of a malicious or obfuscated dependency chain. There are no scripts defined that would normally trigger malicious behavior, but the sheer volume and suspicious naming of dependencies strongly indicate a potential supply chain attack or malware hidden within these dependencies. Installing or running this package would likely result in executing unknown and potentially harmful code from these dependencies."
