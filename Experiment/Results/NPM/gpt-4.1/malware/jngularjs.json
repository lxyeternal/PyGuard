      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary code during installation, which can be used to run malicious scripts. Additionally, the package name 'jngularjs' is similar to the popular 'angularjs' package, and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it might be attempting a dependency confusion attack. Without the content of 'new.js', the exact behavior is unknown, but running a script at preinstall is a common vector for malicious activity."
