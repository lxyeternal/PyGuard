      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json contains an unusually large number of dependencies with obscure, autogenerated-like scoped package names that do not correspond to known or reputable packages. The package and dependency names appear to be Latin phrases or gibberish, which is a common tactic used to obfuscate malicious packages. There is no meaningful description, author information, or tests, which is suspicious. The repository URL points to a GitHub repository under the same suspicious namespace, but the presence of so many dependencies with similar naming patterns strongly suggests this package is part of a dependency confusion or supply chain attack attempt. Such packages often contain malicious code hidden in dependencies that can execute arbitrary code, steal data, or compromise systems when installed. Without inspecting the actual code of these dependencies, the sheer volume and naming pattern of dependencies is a red flag indicating likely malicious intent."
