      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'lngularjs' is a typo-squatting variant of 'angularjs', and the keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests it may be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks. The repository and author information point to a GitHub user named 'serialfuzzer', which may be related to security research or exploitation. Overall, the presence of a preinstall script running an unknown file combined with the suspicious naming and keywords indicates potential malicious intent."
