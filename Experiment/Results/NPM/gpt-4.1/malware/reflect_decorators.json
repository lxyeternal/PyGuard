      "malicious_behavior": "The preinstall script is highly suspicious and malicious. It attempts to gather sensitive system information by running various commands such as 'env', 'ps aux', and reading sensitive files like '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow'. It then encodes the output in base64 and sends it via HTTP POST requests to a remote server with a Burp Collaborator domain, which is commonly used for out-of-band interaction detection in security testing but here indicates data exfiltration. Additionally, it attempts to ping the remote domain to confirm connectivity. This behavior is typical of malware trying to exfiltrate system information and credentials before installation proceeds."
