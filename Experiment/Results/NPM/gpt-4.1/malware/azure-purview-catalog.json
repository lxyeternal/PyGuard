It encodes this information and sends it via DNS queries and an HTTPS POST request to a suspicious external domain (c5c77jy2vtc0000xqshggdrmqmoyyyyyd.interactsh.com), which is a domain commonly used for out-of-band interaction testing and can be used for data exfiltration. The code also attempts to list files from common drive letters (commented out) indicating potential for further data collection. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration typically seen in malicious or spyware code."
