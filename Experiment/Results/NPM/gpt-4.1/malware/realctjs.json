      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node new.js' before installation. This is suspicious because it executes arbitrary JavaScript code during the install phase, which can be used to run malicious code on the user's system. Additionally, the package name 'realctjs' and repository URL 'https://github.com/serialfuzzer/AngulerJS.git' appear unrelated and potentially deceptive. The keyword 'dependency_confusion' suggests this package might be designed to exploit dependency confusion attacks, where a malicious package is published with a name similar to an internal package to trick systems into installing it. Overall, the presence of a preinstall script running an external JS file combined with suspicious naming and keywords indicates malicious intent."
