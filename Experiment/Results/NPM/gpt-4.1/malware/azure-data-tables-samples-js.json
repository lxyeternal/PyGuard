      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including hostname, username, home directory, DNS servers, IP addresses (both private and public), and directory listings from root-level and drive-level paths (e.g., C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on specially crafted domain names derived from the collected data. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests an attempt to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. This behavior is consistent with reconnaissance or data exfiltration typically seen in malicious software or spyware."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious actions on the user's system. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to verify the intent, but the presence of a preinstall script executing a local JavaScript file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
