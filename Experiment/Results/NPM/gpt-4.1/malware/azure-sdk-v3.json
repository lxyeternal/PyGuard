It then encodes this information and sends it via HTTPS POST request to a remote server at '425a2.rt11.ml' on port 443. The obfuscation and the nature of data exfiltration without user consent indicate malicious behavior, likely aimed at spying or unauthorized data collection."

      "malicious_behavior": "The package.json includes a 'preinstall' script that runs 'node index.js' before installation. This is suspicious because running arbitrary code during installation can be used to execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the package name 'azure-sdk-v3' and version '99.10.11' do not correspond to official Azure SDK naming conventions, suggesting it may be a typosquatting or impersonation attempt. The 'author' field is empty, and the description is vague ('glints sdk'), which further raises suspicion. Without the content of 'index.js', it is impossible to definitively determine the payload, but the presence of a preinstall script running a local JS file is a common vector for malicious behavior."
