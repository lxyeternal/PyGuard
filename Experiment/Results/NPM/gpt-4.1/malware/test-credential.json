It then encodes this information and sends it via an HTTPS POST request to an external server (425a2.rt11.ml). The data sent includes potentially sensitive environment details and file system contents. The code also performs DNS lookups on dynamically generated domain names based on the collected data, which can be used for covert data exfiltration or command and control communication. The presence of multiple checks to exclude certain hostnames or paths suggests attempts to evade detection or avoid running in certain environments. Overall, this behavior is consistent with spyware or data exfiltration malware."
