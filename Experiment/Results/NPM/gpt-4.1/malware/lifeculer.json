      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute system commands and install Python packages without user consent. Specifically, it tries to read a 'checker.json' file from the %temp% directory, and if not found or an error occurs, it runs a Python version check. If Python is detected, it installs several Python packages (httpx, pycrypto, pypiwin32) via pip, then runs a Python script 'main.py' in the background. It also writes a 'checker.json' file with {\"checker\":\"true\"} to %temp%. This behavior indicates the code is trying to set up and run a Python-based payload silently, which is typical of malicious scripts that attempt to persist or execute further malicious code. The use of console clearing and color-coded logs may be attempts to obfuscate or distract from these actions."
