29	* ``CORS_EXTRA_ALLOW_HEADERS``: headers that are allowed to be sent as part of the cross-domain request. By default, Authorization, Accept-Crs and Content-Crs are already included. The value of this variable is added to these already included headers. Defaults to: ``[]``.
30	Celery
31	------
32	* ``CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND``: the URL of the backend/broker that will be used by Celery to send the notifications. Defaults to: ``redis://localhost:6379/1``.

48	Optional
49	--------
50	* ``SITE_ID``: The database ID of the site object. You usually won't have to touch this. Defaults to: ``1``.
51	* ``DEBUG``: Only set this to ``True`` on a local development environment. Various other security settings are derived from this setting!. Defaults to: ``False``.
52	* ``USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST``: whether to grab the domain/host from the X-Forwarded-Host header or not. This header is typically set by reverse proxies (such as nginx, traefik, Apache...). Note: this is a header that can be spoofed and you need to ensure you control it before enabling this. Defaults to: ``False``.
53	* ``IS_HTTPS``: Used to construct absolute URLs and controls a variety of security settings. Defaults to the inverse of ``DEBUG``.
54	* ``EMAIL_PORT``: port number of the outgoing e-mail server. Note that if you're on Google Cloud, sending e-mail via port 25 is completely blocked and you should use 487 for TLS. Defaults to: ``25``.
55	* ``EMAIL_HOST_USER``: username to connect to the mail server. Defaults to: ``(empty string)``.
56	* ``EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD``: password to connect to the mail server. Defaults to: ``(empty string)``.

61	* ``LOG_QUERIES``: enable (query) logging at the database backend level. Note that you must also set ``DEBUG=1``, which should be done very sparingly!. Defaults to: ``False``.
62	* ``LOG_REQUESTS``: enable logging of the outgoing requests. Defaults to: ``False``.
63	* ``CELERY_LOGLEVEL``: control the verbosity of logging output for celery, independent of ``LOG_LEVEL``. Available values are ``CRITICAL``, ``ERROR``, ``WARNING``, ``INFO`` and ``DEBUG``. Defaults to: ``INFO``.
64	* ``SESSION_COOKIE_AGE``: For how long, in seconds, the session cookie will be valid. Defaults to: ``1209600``.
65	* ``SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE``: The value of the SameSite flag on the session cookie. This flag prevents the cookie from being sent in cross-site requests thus preventing CSRF attacks and making some methods of stealing session cookie impossible.Currently interferes with OIDC. Keep the value set at Lax if used. Defaults to: ``Lax``.
66	* ``CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE``: The value of the SameSite flag on the CSRF cookie. This flag prevents the cookie from being sent in cross-site requests. Defaults to: ``Strict``.
67	* ``ENVIRONMENT``: An identifier for the environment, displayed in the admin depending on the settings module used and included in the error monitoring (see ``SENTRY_DSN``). The default is set according to ``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE``.
68	* ``SUBPATH``: If hosted on a subpath, provide the value here. If you provide ``/gateway``, the component assumes its running at the base URL: ``https://somedomain/gateway/``. Defaults to an empty string. Defaults to: ``None``.
69	* ``RELEASE``: The version number or commit hash of the application (this is also sent to Sentry).
70	* ``NUM_PROXIES``: the number of reverse proxies in front of the application, as an integer. This is used to determine the actual client IP adres. On Kubernetes with an ingress you typically want to set this to 2. Defaults to: ``1``.
71	* ``CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS``: A list of trusted origins for unsafe requests (e.g. POST). Defaults to: ``[]``.
72	* ``NOTIFICATIONS_DISABLED``: indicates whether or not notifications should be sent to the Notificaties API for operations on the API endpoints. Defaults to ``True`` for the ``dev`` environment, otherwise defaults to ``False``.
73	* ``SITE_DOMAIN``: Defines the primary domain where the application is hosted. Defaults to: ``(empty string)``.
74	* ``SENTRY_DSN``: URL of the sentry project to send error reports to. Default empty, i.e. -> no monitoring set up. Highly recommended to configure this.
75	* ``DISABLE_2FA``: Whether or not two factor authentication should be disabled. Defaults to: ``False``.
76	* ``LOG_OUTGOING_REQUESTS_EMIT_BODY``: Whether or not outgoing request bodies should be logged. Defaults to: ``True``.
77	* ``LOG_OUTGOING_REQUESTS_DB_SAVE``: Whether or not outgoing request logs should be saved to the database. Defaults to: ``False``.
78	* ``LOG_OUTGOING_REQUESTS_DB_SAVE_BODY``: Whether or not outgoing request bodies should be saved to the database. Defaults to: ``True``.
79	* ``LOG_OUTGOING_REQUESTS_MAX_AGE``: The amount of time after which request logs should be deleted from the database. Defaults to: ``7``.
80	Specifying the environment variables
81	=====================================
82	There are two strategies to specify the environment variables:
83	* provide them in a ``.env`` file
84	* start the component processes (with uwsgi/gunicorn/celery) in a process
85	  manager that defines the environment variables
86	Providing a .env file
87	---------------------
88	This is the most simple setup and easiest to debug. The ``.env`` file must be
89	at the root of the project - i.e. on the same level as the ``src`` directory (
90	NOT *in* the ``src`` directory).
91	The syntax is key-value:
92	.. code::
93	   SOME_VAR=some_value
94	   OTHER_VAR="quoted_value"
95	Provide the envvars via the process manager
96	-------------------------------------------
97	If you use a process manager (such as supervisor/systemd), use their techniques
98	to define the envvars. The component will pick them up out of the box.
