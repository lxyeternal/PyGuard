      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during the installation process, establishes a reverse shell connection to an external IP address (104.248.19.57 on port 3333). It redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket and spawns a shell (/bin/sh), effectively giving an attacker remote control over the compromised system. This behavior is characteristic of malicious backdoors or remote access trojans (RATs), enabling unauthorized remote command execution and control.",
