      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (mezLYlFERIvLubZWTlLxzepCnlyvpKHQ) that, when the package is installed on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a byte string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide the true behavior of the code from static analysis and to deliver malware, such as backdoors, credential stealers, or remote access trojans. The code only triggers on Windows systems, further suggesting targeted malicious activity. The obfuscated variable names and lack of legitimate package functionality reinforce the conclusion that this is a malicious package designed to execute hidden code on the installer's system.",
