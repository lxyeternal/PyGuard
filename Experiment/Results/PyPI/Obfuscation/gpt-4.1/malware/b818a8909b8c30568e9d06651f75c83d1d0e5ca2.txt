      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload that, upon execution on Windows systems, downloads an executable from a remote URL and saves it to the user's startup folder as 'Update.exe'. It then attempts to execute this file, which likely results in persistent malware infection. The code is designed to run silently, evade detection, and establish persistence by auto-starting the malicious executable every time the user logs in. This behavior indicates clear malicious intent, such as remote control, data theft, or system compromise.",
