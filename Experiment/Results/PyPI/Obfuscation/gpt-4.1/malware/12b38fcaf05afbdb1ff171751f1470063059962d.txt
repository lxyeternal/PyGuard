      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It is designed to exfiltrate sensitive information from the system where it is installed. Specifically, during the installation process (via a custom setuptools install_scripts command), it collects the following data: the system's hostname, current working directory, public IP address (by querying external services), and all IP addresses associated with the host. It then encodes this information and sends it out via DNS queries to a hardcoded domain (tkhifq33bf1r414tr9fqnn06txznnc.burpcollaborator.net) using a specified DNS server (defaulting to 8.8.8.8). This is a classic data exfiltration technique that can bypass some network monitoring tools, as DNS traffic is often less scrutinized. The code also attempts to disguise itself as a legitimate pip-related package and prints a misleading message about being a 'security test.' The use of obfuscated variable names and unnecessary complexity further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This code poses a significant security risk and should not be executed.",
