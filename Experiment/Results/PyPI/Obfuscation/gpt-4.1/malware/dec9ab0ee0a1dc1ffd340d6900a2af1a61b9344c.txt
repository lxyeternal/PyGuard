      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() to run decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The actual payload is hidden from static analysis, but this pattern is commonly used to deliver malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration tools. The obfuscated variable names and the use of setup_requires to pull in dependencies further indicate an attempt to evade detection. Installing this package could compromise the system.",
