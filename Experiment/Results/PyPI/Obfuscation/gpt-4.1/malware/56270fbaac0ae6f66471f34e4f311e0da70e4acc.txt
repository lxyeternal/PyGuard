It searches through specific browser and application directories for files, scans their contents for patterns matching Discord tokens, and collects these tokens. It then sends the collected tokens to a specified Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive user credentials without consent. Additionally, the code constructs a detailed message with system and token information and attempts to send it via an HTTP POST request, indicating malicious intent to harvest and transmit user data surreptitiously.",
