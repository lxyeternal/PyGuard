      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It is designed to steal the user's Roblox authentication cookie (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Opera) using the browser_cookie3 library. It then validates the cookie, collects sensitive account information (username, Robux balance, premium status, account age, friends count, RAP, creation date, IP address), and sends all of this data, including the authentication cookie, to an external Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account and potentially cause financial and reputational harm. The code is heavily obfuscated with random variable names to evade detection and analysis.",
