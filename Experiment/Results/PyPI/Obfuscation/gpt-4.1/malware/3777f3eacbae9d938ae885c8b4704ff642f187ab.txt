      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command is run with a hidden window, indicating an intent to operate covertly. Although the exact payload is encoded, such obfuscation and silent execution strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially to download, install, or execute malicious code without user awareness. The presence of this obfuscated command execution is a significant indicator of malicious behavior.",
