      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It uses obfuscation (exec with chr/map) to hide its true intent. The code attempts to install a large number of Python packages (some of which are suspicious or not standard, e.g., 'pycaw', 'pyautogui', 'pycryptodome', 'discord', 'browsers_history', etc.), which is a common tactic for preparing an environment for further exploitation or data exfiltration. More critically, the function 'send_discord_info' downloads and executes a remote Python script from 'https://pastebin.pl/view/raw/e0db51a5', saves it as 'WindowsDefender.py' in the user's home directory, executes it, and then deletes the file. This is a classic remote code execution and persistence technique, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The use of 'exec' to run the downloaded code further increases the risk, as it can execute any payload the attacker chooses to serve. This behavior can lead to full system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
