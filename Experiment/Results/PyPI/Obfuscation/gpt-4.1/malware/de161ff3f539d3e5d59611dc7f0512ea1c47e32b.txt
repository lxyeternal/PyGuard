      "malicious_behavior": "The code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via `exec`. When decoded, it appears to be a complex, encrypted, or encoded payload that likely contains malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or malware installation. The use of `exec` on decoded data is a common technique to hide malicious intent, making analysis difficult and indicating intent to execute potentially harmful code without easy detection. Overall, this code is designed to conceal malicious activities and should be considered malicious.",
