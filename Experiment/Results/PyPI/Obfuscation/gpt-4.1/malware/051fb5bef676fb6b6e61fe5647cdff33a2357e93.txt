      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It uses PyArmor, a commercial obfuscation and code protection tool, to execute a large, opaque, and encrypted payload. The code imports pytransform, calls pyarmor_runtime(), and then invokes a function __pyarmor__ with a massive encrypted byte string. This is a classic pattern for running obfuscated or protected code, which is commonly used to hide the true intent of the script. The actual behavior of the payload cannot be determined without decryption, but such techniques are often used to conceal malware, backdoors, credential stealers, or other harmful activities. The use of strong obfuscation and encrypted payloads is a red flag, especially when there is no legitimate reason for such protection (e.g., commercial software licensing). In summary, this code is almost certainly malicious or at least designed to evade analysis and hide its true purpose.",
