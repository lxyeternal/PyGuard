      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (ThnpbKVfhJSvuIUQwCrWZLTuNeiBRfwj) that, when run on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed at install time, making static analysis difficult. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The payload could perform any action, such as data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or system compromise. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted code further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis. This package is highly dangerous and should not be installed.",
