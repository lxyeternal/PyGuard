      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded payload and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. The payload, when decoded, imports the 'lib' module and makes an HTTP request to a suspicious URL ('https://cyberresearch.pythonanywhere.com/reporter.py'), then decodes the response. This behavior indicates an attempt to fetch and execute remote malicious code, potentially allowing remote command execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The presence of obfuscated imports and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to access and read the contents of a 'cacert.pem' file from the 'certifi' package, which is typically used to obtain SSL/TLS certificate authorities. While this behavior alone is not inherently malicious, the obfuscated and inconsistent manner in which the code retrieves and reads this certificate file suggests an attempt to hide its true purpose. Such behavior can be part of a malicious script that exfiltrates or verifies SSL certificates to facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks, intercept secure communications, or verify the presence of certain security files for malicious purposes. The code's obfuscation and conditional logic across different Python versions further indicate an intent to evade detection or analysis. Therefore, this code is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if embedded in a context where such access is unnecessary or unexpected.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports modules from the 'certifi' package using obfuscated, nonsensical attribute names, which do not correspond to any known functions or classes within 'certifi'. It then calls these imported objects as functions, which would result in runtime errors unless these are maliciously crafted objects with callable behavior. The obfuscation and nonsensical attribute names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent or payload. Additionally, the code's structure indicates it may be designed to execute different functions based on command-line arguments, potentially executing malicious code or exfiltrating data if the imported objects are malicious. Overall, the obfuscation, nonsensical imports, and dynamic execution pattern strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at hiding its true purpose.",
