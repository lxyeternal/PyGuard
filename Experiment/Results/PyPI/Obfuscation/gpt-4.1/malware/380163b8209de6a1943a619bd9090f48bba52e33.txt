      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that, on macOS systems, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, user ID, current directory, and network configuration. It then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP request to an external IP address (81.70.191.194) without user consent or awareness. This behavior indicates data exfiltration and unauthorized surveillance, which are malicious activities. Additionally, the code's obfuscated variable names and the use of system commands suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent.",
