      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during the installation process, collects system information such as hostname, username, and current directory, then serializes and encodes this data. It further splits the encoded data into chunks and generates random strings, seemingly to obfuscate or prepare for covert communication. The code constructs domain-like strings with embedded variables, which suggests it may be attempting to generate or communicate with malicious command-and-control servers or exfiltrate data covertly. The obfuscation, data collection, and potential network activity indicate malicious intent, likely for data exfiltration or remote control purposes.",
