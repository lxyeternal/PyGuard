      "malicious_behavior": "The code is heavily obfuscated with multiple layers of encoding, dynamic imports, and runtime code execution. It dynamically constructs and executes code snippets, often using XOR-based string transformations, which are typical techniques to hide malicious intent. The code appears to perform network operations (e.g., importing 'httpx_socks', 'threading', 'secrets', and making HTTP requests), and it manipulates data in a way that suggests it could be exfiltrating data, executing remote commands, or establishing covert communication channels. The presence of functions that set and get attributes, dynamically import modules, and execute code from obfuscated strings strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at evading detection and maintaining persistence or control over the host system.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated, heavily encrypted, and dynamically loaded modules that perform malicious activities such as executing arbitrary code, possibly downloading or executing external payloads, and manipulating system or network resources. The use of dynamic imports, encrypted strings, and complex control flow strongly suggests an intent to hide malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or malware deployment. The code's structure and obfuscation techniques are typical of malware or advanced persistent threats (APTs).",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains numerous obfuscated and encrypted data segments, dynamic imports, and functions that execute code via eval, exec, or threading, often with complex, encrypted, or encoded payloads. The presence of multiple layers of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and threading functions suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code likely decrypts or decodes payloads at runtime, which could be used to execute malicious scripts, download or run malware, or perform unauthorized actions on the host system. Overall, this pattern is characteristic of malware or malicious scripts designed to evade detection and execute harmful operations.",
