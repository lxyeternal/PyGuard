      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common technique to avoid repeated execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a script that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is intended to evade detection by users and security software. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script. This code is highly dangerous and should not be executed.",
