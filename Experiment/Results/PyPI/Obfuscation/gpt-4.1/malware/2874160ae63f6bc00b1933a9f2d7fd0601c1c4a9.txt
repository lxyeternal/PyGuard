      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly malicious information-stealing malware designed to extract sensitive user data from various applications and browsers. It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n- **Credential Harvesting:** Extracts stored passwords, cookies, and tokens from browsers like Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, and Discord by copying their local databases, decrypting stored credentials, and parsing log files.\n- **Token Theft:** Finds and validates Discord tokens and other authentication tokens, then exfiltrates them.\n- **Account Data Collection:** Gathers user profile information, email, phone number, Nitro status, badges, billing info, and friends list from Discord accounts.\n- **File Stealing:** Searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files containing keywords related to accounts, passwords, crypto wallets, and tokens, then zips and uploads them.\n- **Wallet and Application Data:** Archives wallet files (e.g., Exodus, Atomic Wallet), gaming client data (Steam, Riot), and other application data.\n- **Data Exfiltration:** Sends all collected data to a specified Discord webhook, effectively stealing user credentials, tokens, cookies, and files.\n- **Persistence and Obfuscation:** Uses threading for concurrent operations, attempts to install missing modules, and employs obfuscation techniques like regex parsing and dynamic file handling.\n\nOverall, this code is a comprehensive credential stealer targeting browsers, Discord, crypto wallets, and other applications, with the purpose of compromising user accounts and sensitive information for malicious use or resale.",
