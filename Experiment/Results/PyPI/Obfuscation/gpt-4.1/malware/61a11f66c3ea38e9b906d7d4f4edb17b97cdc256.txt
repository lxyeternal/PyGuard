      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making static analysis difficult. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The payload could perform any action, such as data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or system compromise. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names and hides its true purpose, further indicating malicious behavior. This package, if installed, will execute hidden code on the victim's machine, potentially causing significant harm.",
