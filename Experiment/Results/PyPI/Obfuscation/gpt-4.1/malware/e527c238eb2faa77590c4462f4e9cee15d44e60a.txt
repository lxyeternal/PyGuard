      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs multiple suspicious and potentially malicious actions: (1) It overrides core socket functions and socket.getaddrinfo to intercept and modify network connections, including replacing DNS resolution and TCP connection behavior, which can facilitate man-in-the-middle attacks or traffic redirection. (2) It patches environment variables and imports modules like 'requests' and 'gunicorn' to inject custom behaviors, such as injecting cookies and TCP port mappings, indicating an attempt to manipulate HTTP requests and network traffic. (3) It conditionally executes code based on environment variables, potentially targeting specific deployment environments. (4) It patches the 'gunicorn' worker and connection cleanup routines to insert custom logging and connection handling, possibly to hide malicious activity or maintain persistence. (5) It encodes UUIDs into base62, which could be used for covert communication or tracking. Overall, these behaviors suggest the code is designed to intercept, manipulate, and potentially exfiltrate data or control network traffic surreptitiously, indicating malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is obfuscated and attempts to execute dynamically constructed code via an eval/exec statement. It uses string reversal and indexing tricks to hide its true intent. The presence of a try-except block that suppresses errors suggests an attempt to conceal malicious actions. The code appears to invoke functions and methods with obfuscated names, likely to perform malicious operations such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or other harmful activities. Overall, this code is designed to hide malicious behavior and should be considered malicious.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a configuration validation and storage mechanism with obfuscated variable names, which is often used to hide malicious intent. It maintains a set of allowed environments and regions, raising exceptions if the current environment or region is not recognized. The functions `gOKJJRPUSPmEUyjJCGVlgOSIqxeAyYqM` and related logic suggest it is tracking certain identifiers (`rkWMzYahstPghuasJFTqfzDkFLKaACdy`) and storing associated values in a global dictionary. The obfuscation, combined with the pattern of validating environment/region and storing arbitrary key-value pairs, indicates it could be used for malicious purposes such as secret data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or covert configuration management. The code's structure and naming conventions strongly suggest it is designed to hide its true intent, which is characteristic of malicious scripts.",
