      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed code that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it at runtime. The decoded payload appears to be designed to perform network requests to external URLs (e.g., https://pst.klgtrg.io/paste/bcexv/raw), which could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, command and control communication, or downloading additional malicious payloads. Additionally, the code imports and uses potentially dangerous modules and functions (like exec and compile) in a way that obscures its true intent, indicating malicious intent to evade detection. The presence of such obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at hiding its true purpose and potentially compromising the target system.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed payloads that decode base64-encoded malicious scripts, which likely perform unauthorized actions such as executing system commands, manipulating terminal output, or potentially executing harmful code. The presence of base64 decoding, use of 'exec', and complex, opaque functions suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code includes functions for terminal manipulation, cursor hiding, and animated text, which could be used to mask malicious activities or deceive users. Overall, the code exhibits typical signs of malicious obfuscation and behavior, indicating it is malicious.",
