      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory and then running it. This behavior is typical of malware droppers, which are used to download and execute additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and try/except to suppress errors) further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
