      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (oxCqgfvtSdVjdIeQxVpLuTCyRNgQZfoY) that, when the package is installed on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes code that is decrypted at runtime using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This technique is commonly used to hide the true intent of the code and evade static analysis. The decrypted code is not visible in the source, but the use of runtime decryption and execution (via exec) is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it can be used to download and execute further malware, steal information, or perform other harmful actions on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names and the targeting of Windows systems further supports the conclusion that this is a malicious package.",
