      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly sophisticated malware designed for data theft and espionage. It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n- **Token and Credential Stealing:** Extracts Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and other sensitive data from various browsers and applications, including Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, and Steam. It copies and decrypts stored login data, cookies, and local state files, then exfiltrates this information.\n- **Account Information Gathering:** Uses Discord API endpoints to gather user relationships, billing info, and badges, likely to identify high-value targets or for further exploitation.\n- **File and Data Exfiltration:** Collects files from specific directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) and sensitive application data, zips them, and uploads to external servers.\n- **Remote Command Execution and Process Termination:** Kills specific processes (e.g., browsers, Steam, Metamask) to prevent interference, then archives and exfiltrates their data.\n- **Webhook Notification:** Sends detailed reports of stolen data, including tokens, emails, IP addresses, and other personal info, to a Discord webhook controlled by the attacker.\n- **Persistence and Obfuscation:** Uses threading, environment variables, and obfuscated variable names to evade detection.\n\nOverall, the code is clearly designed for malicious purposes, primarily to steal sensitive user data, credentials, and tokens, and to exfiltrate this information to an attacker-controlled server. It exhibits typical traits of malware, including data harvesting, process killing, file archiving, and remote exfiltration.",
