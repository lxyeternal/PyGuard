It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain ('fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com'), which could be used for malicious purposes such as tracking, data exfiltration, or reconnaissance. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code designed to gather and transmit user environment details without user consent, indicating clear malicious intent.",
