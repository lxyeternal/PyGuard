      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() to run the decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide the true behavior of the code from static analysis and to deliver malware, such as backdoors, credential stealers, or remote access trojans. The code only activates on Windows systems, further suggesting a targeted attack. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted payloads are classic hallmarks of malware designed to evade detection.",
