      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that is decoded from a base64-encoded, compressed (lzma) byte string and executed dynamically via `exec()`. This pattern is a common technique used in malware to hide malicious intent. The payload likely performs unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or other malicious activities. Additionally, the code attempts to disguise its true purpose by embedding the payload within a setup script, which could be used to trick users or automated systems into executing it. Overall, the presence of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and the hidden payload strongly indicates malicious behavior.",
