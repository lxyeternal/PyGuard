      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `ElVYJWBWJJOalhlSZIzprwvUqNUzUHOn()` that downloads an executable file (`Cleaner.exe`) from a remote URL (`https://a4a08d21-3950-435e-8b39-12ab7788cd10.id.repl.co/Cleaner.exe`) and then executes it with elevated privileges using `os.system('set __COMPACT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker | start Cleaner.exe')`. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and run potentially malicious software on the host system, which is characteristic of malware or remote code execution attacks. Additionally, the code integrates this malicious payload into the setup process by invoking it during the installation or development commands, further embedding malicious behavior into legitimate package installation workflows.",
