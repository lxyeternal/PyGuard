      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a backdoor that establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server at IP 49.233.121.53 on port 54. It decodes the IP and port from base64, creates a socket connection, and redirects the process's input/output streams to this socket, then spawns an interactive shell. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system, which is a clear malicious behavior intended for unauthorized remote access and control.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a system command that outputs the message \"恶意代码执行成功\" (which translates to \"Malicious code executed successfully\"). While the command itself is benign in appearance, the context suggests that the script is designed to simulate or indicate successful malicious activity. The use of a function with a nonsensical name and the execution of a system command are common traits in malicious scripts attempting to obfuscate or demonstrate malicious intent. Therefore, this code is considered malicious as it explicitly executes a system command, which could be exploited for harmful purposes or serve as a proof of concept for malicious behavior.",
