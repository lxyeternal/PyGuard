      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which can be used to deliver further malware to the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup metadata) is intended to evade detection. This code poses a significant security risk, as it can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or further compromise of the system.",
