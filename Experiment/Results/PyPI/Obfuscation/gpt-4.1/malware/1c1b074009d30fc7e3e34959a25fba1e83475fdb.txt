      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden network request that exfiltrates system information, including the username, IP address, and environment variables, to an external server ('https://eo6sl0hu84cr4pa.m.pipedream.net'). This behavior is characteristic of data theft or command-and-control communication, which is typical in malicious scripts. Additionally, the code constructs and encodes environment variables into a base64 string, possibly to obfuscate the data being sent. The presence of such a network call without any legitimate purpose, combined with obfuscation techniques, indicates malicious intent aimed at compromising user privacy and security.",
