      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that, when decoded and executed, performs several actions indicative of malicious intent. It appears to import modules related to system operations, networking, and subprocess management, and then executes a script that likely attempts to establish unauthorized network connections, possibly to exfiltrate data or control the system remotely. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and the use of dynamic execution (exec) are common techniques used to hide malicious behavior. Additionally, the code references suspicious URLs and commands that suggest it may be designed to download or execute further malicious payloads, or to communicate with command-and-control servers. Overall, the code exhibits typical traits of malware or backdoor scripts, making it malicious.",
