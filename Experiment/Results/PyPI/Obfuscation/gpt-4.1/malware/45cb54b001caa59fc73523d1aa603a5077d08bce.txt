      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, which is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malicious code (such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions) during the installation of a Python package. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and execution during the install process are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The actual decrypted payload is not visible in the provided code, but the mechanism is clearly designed to execute hidden code on the victim's machine, which is a hallmark of malware.",
