      "malicious_behavior": "The code is highly obfuscated and employs extensive use of base64 and zlib compression/decompression, which is a common technique to hide malicious payloads. It appears to extract sensitive data such as browser cookies, passwords, and system information (HWID, IP, MAC address) from the victim's machine. It then encrypts and exfiltrates this data via Discord webhooks, indicating data theft and remote command-and-control capabilities. The code also manipulates system files, kills processes, and deletes traces, which are typical behaviors of malware or spyware. Overall, the script is designed to stealthily gather, encrypt, and send sensitive user and system data to an attacker-controlled server, confirming malicious intent.",
