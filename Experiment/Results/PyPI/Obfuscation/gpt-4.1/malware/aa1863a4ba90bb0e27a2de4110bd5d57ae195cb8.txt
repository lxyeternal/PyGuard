      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic dropper behavior, where the Python script acts as a loader for a potentially malicious executable. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup metadata) is intended to evade detection and analysis. This code can compromise the system by downloading and executing arbitrary code from the internet, which is a severe security risk.",
