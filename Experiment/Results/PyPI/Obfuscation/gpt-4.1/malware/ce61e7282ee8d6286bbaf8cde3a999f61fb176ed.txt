      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. It installs a Chrome extension by creating a 'background.js' script with obfuscated code, which appears to be designed for malicious purposes such as data theft or browser hijacking. Additionally, it modifies Windows shortcut (.lnk) files across various system directories to automatically load this extension when Chrome, Edge, or Brave browsers are launched, effectively persisting malicious code on the system. The extension's script includes obfuscated JavaScript that manipulates clipboard data and potentially intercepts sensitive information like cryptocurrency addresses, suggesting intent to steal or monitor user data. These behaviors—installing malicious extensions, modifying system shortcuts for persistence, and obfuscated code—are characteristic of malware or spyware, confirming the code's malicious nature.",
