      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by reading and executing a potentially harmful file ('WebQuickAuth/tmp.py') from disk and dynamically importing it into the current process. Specifically, it writes the contents of 'WebQuickAuth/tmp.py' into a file in the source file's directory and then imports it, which can be used to execute arbitrary code, perform malicious activities such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or establishing backdoors. Additionally, the code conditionally prints source file information and manipulates environment variables, which may be used to evade detection or facilitate malicious operations. Overall, these actions indicate an attempt to execute hidden or malicious code at runtime, making this code malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity. It attempts to create a persistent, hidden cache file in the system's temporary directory and monitors its modification time to avoid repeated execution. It then spawns a background thread that establishes an encrypted socket connection to a remote IP address (8.217.153.123) on port 8889, likely for command and control (C2) communication. The data received over this connection is read, reconstructed, base64-decoded, and decompressed, suggesting it is receiving and executing obfuscated payloads or commands. This pattern is characteristic of malware or backdoor behavior, enabling remote control, data exfiltration, or further malicious actions.",
