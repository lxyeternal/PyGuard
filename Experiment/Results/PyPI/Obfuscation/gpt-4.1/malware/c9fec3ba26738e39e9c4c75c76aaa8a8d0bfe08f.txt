      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (QKSSxLDXlMSAOixBEiZbGjeXrnqTzgGx) that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, credential stealers, or downloaders, on the victim's machine. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis. The code only triggers on Windows, suggesting it targets that platform specifically. The potential harm includes full compromise of the system where the package is installed.",
