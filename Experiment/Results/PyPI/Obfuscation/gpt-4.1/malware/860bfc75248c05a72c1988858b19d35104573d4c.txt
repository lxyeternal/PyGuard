      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It dynamically downloads and executes code from a remote server using the exec() function. Specifically, it constructs a URL (http://files.inostage.ru/version/check/a), fetches the content from this URL using the requests library, and immediately executes the fetched code. This behavior is highly dangerous, as it allows the remote server to deliver and execute arbitrary Python code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. Additionally, the use of obfuscated variable names and the lack of any validation or sanitization of the downloaded code further indicate malicious intent.",
