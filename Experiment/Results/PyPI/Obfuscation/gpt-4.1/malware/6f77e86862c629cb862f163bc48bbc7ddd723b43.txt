      "malicious_behavior": "The code is heavily obfuscated and employs multiple layers of decoding, eval, and dynamic execution. It decodes base64-encoded strings, then decodes further encoded data, and finally executes the resulting code via eval. This pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to hide their true intent, which often includes downloading, executing, or manipulating system files, or establishing backdoors. The use of eval with dynamically decoded code indicates an attempt to run hidden or malicious payloads, making this code malicious. It could be used for executing arbitrary code, downloading malware, or establishing persistent backdoors, posing significant security risks.",
