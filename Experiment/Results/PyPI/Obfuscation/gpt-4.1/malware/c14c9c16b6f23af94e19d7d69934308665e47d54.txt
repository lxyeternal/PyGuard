      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package using setuptools. The custom install class (BsUlXdScNZhRfzxypcUmjWtvpmHVivhX) overrides the install process to execute an additional command: it runs a Python module ('poc_nvk.my_module') as a subprocess during installation. This is a classic 'setup.py' attack pattern, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine when they install the package (e.g., via pip). The use of obfuscated class and method names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The executed module ('poc_nvk.my_module') could perform any action, including downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. This behavior is highly dangerous and constitutes a supply chain attack vector.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code collects sensitive system information from the host machine, including the hostname, operating system name, and local IP address. It then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to an external server (https://eowdq5q6u6qkhxe.m.pipedream.net/poc) without the user's knowledge or consent. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware, as it exfiltrates potentially identifying or sensitive data to a remote endpoint. Such actions can be used for reconnaissance, profiling, or as part of a larger attack chain. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive function and variable names, which is a common tactic to evade detection and hinder analysis.",
