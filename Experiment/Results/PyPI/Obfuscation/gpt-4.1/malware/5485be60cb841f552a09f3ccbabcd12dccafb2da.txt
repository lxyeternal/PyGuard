The base64 string decodes to a command that uses 'curl' to download content from a remote URL ('https://cdn.discorapp.com/attachements/1169414844689174588/11889453743...') and pipes it directly into 'min ckd', which appears to be a typo or obfuscated command. This behavior suggests an attempt to fetch and execute remote malicious code or payloads during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, malware infection, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and execution during setup indicates malicious intent.",
