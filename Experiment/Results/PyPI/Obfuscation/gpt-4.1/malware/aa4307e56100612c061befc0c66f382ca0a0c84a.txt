This behavior is suspicious because it involves collecting system information and transmitting it to an external server without user consent, which is characteristic of data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities. The code does not perform any legitimate setup functions related to the package itself and appears designed solely to gather and leak system information, indicating malicious intent.",
