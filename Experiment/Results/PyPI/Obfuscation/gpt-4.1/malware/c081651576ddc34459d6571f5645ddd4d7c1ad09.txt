      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a segment that, on Windows (nt) systems, executes a base64-encoded payload which appears to be a complex, obfuscated script. This payload decodes and runs code that performs network operations, likely establishing a proxy or backdoor, and includes logic to connect to external servers, potentially for command and control (C2) purposes. The presence of such obfuscated, dynamically decoded code that interacts with network-related keywords (e.g., 'proxy', 'socks', 'http', 'https') and the conditional execution on Windows suggests malicious intent, such as remote control, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The rest of the script appears to be a package setup, which is benign, but the embedded payload indicates malicious behavior.",
