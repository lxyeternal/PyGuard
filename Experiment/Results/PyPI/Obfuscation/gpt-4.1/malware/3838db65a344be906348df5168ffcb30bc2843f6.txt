      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that overrides the install command to execute a base64-encoded shell command during installation. This command decodes and runs a script that establishes a reverse shell connection to an external IP address (121.4.154.240) on port 4501, allowing remote attackers to gain unauthorized shell access to the compromised system. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, such as backdooring or remote control, and poses significant security risks.",
