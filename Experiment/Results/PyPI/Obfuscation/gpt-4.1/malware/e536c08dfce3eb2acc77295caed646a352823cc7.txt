      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encoded payloads that are dynamically decoded and executed using `marshal.loads`, `base64`, and `marshal.loads`. It appears to download or execute hidden code, potentially malicious scripts or payloads, which could be used for unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or remote control. The presence of base64-encoded, marshaled data and the use of `exec` strongly suggest malicious intent, especially since the code is designed to run arbitrary, obfuscated code snippets. Additionally, it interacts with Telegram via the Telethon library, possibly to receive commands or send data covertly. Overall, the code exhibits typical characteristics of malicious scripts, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hidden payloads, indicating it is malicious.",
