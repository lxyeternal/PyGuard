      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is a setup script for a Python package that declares dependencies on 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. While the script itself does not directly perform any malicious actions, the combination of these dependencies is highly suspicious and commonly associated with information-stealing malware. 'browser_cookie3' is used to extract browser cookies, 'discordwebhook' is used to exfiltrate data via Discord webhooks, and 'robloxpy' is often used in malicious packages targeting Roblox users. The package name 'woqe23un47i6vjuj' is nonsensical and resembles those used in malware campaigns to evade detection. The likely intent is to install dependencies that can be used to steal sensitive user data (such as browser cookies and Roblox credentials) and send it to an attacker via Discord. Therefore, this setup script is part of a malicious package ecosystem.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior. It uses eval and dynamic code execution extensively, with variable and function names that are random and meaningless, which is a common obfuscation technique to hinder analysis. The code decodes large blobs of base64 and hexadecimal data, then further decodes and executes them, likely to reconstruct and run a hidden payload at runtime. The use of multiple layers of encoding (base64, hex, bz2, uu, etc.) is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade detection and static analysis. The final payload is executed via eval, and the code appears to be designed to reconstruct and run arbitrary code, which could be anything from a backdoor, data exfiltration tool, or other forms of malware. The presence of such techniques, especially in combination, is a strong indicator of malicious intent and potential harm, such as unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.",
