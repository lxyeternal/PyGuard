      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to collect system information such as hostname, current working directory, username, and IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6). It encodes and obfuscates this data, then sends it via an HTTP POST request to a remote server ('https://425a2.rt11.ml'). The code also attempts to resolve a hostname constructed from the collected data, which could be used for further malicious activities like command and control communication or data exfiltration. Additionally, it modifies network interface data and encodes parts of the system environment, indicating an intent to gather and transmit sensitive system details covertly. The use of obfuscation, data encoding, and external communication strongly suggests malicious intent, likely for tracking, espionage, or establishing a backdoor.",
