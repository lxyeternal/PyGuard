      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making static analysis difficult. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The payload could perform any number of harmful actions, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or further malware installation. The obfuscated variable and class names, as well as the use of encrypted code, are classic techniques to evade detection and hinder analysis. This code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful actions on the victim's machine during package installation.",
