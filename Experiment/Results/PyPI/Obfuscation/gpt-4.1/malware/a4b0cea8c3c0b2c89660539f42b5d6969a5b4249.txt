      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a seemingly benign setup script that primarily contains a large block of HTML/Markdown content for a project description, along with a standard setup() call. However, it includes a suspiciously obfuscated string ('rOisBqkklcVlAKSTMfJzcuoRaDLGepOI=') assigned to the 'authors' parameter, which does not conform to typical usage. This string resembles base64-encoded data, and its presence suggests an attempt to embed or hide malicious payloads or data within the package metadata. Such obfuscation can be used to conceal malicious intent, such as exfiltrating data, executing hidden code, or compromising systems when the package is installed or inspected. Therefore, despite the superficial appearance, the code contains malicious behavior aimed at hiding malicious payloads or activities.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. It downloads external files from potentially malicious URLs and saves them to the system's TEMP directory and a specific path within the Python installation directory. Specifically, it retrieves a DLL-like file and a Python script, which could be used to execute malicious payloads or establish persistence. Additionally, the code attempts to start a process with a filename derived from the current executable, potentially executing malicious code or payloads. The presence of obfuscated variable names and the download of external content from suspicious URLs strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at compromising the host system, establishing persistence, or executing malicious payloads.",
