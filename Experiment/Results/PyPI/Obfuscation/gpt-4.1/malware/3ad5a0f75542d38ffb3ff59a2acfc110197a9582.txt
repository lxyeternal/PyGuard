      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the installation process, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain ('cdf7ymt2vtc0000eer0gggz6haayyyyyf.oast.fun'), which is likely controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, a common malicious tactic to gather information about the target system. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
