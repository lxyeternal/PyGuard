The embedded base64 string decodes to marshaled Python code, which is a common obfuscation technique used to hide malicious behavior. The decoded payload appears to include references to network resources (e.g., URLs) and potentially harmful actions such as downloading or executing remote files, establishing connections, or executing arbitrary code. Overall, this code is designed to conceal malicious activities, making it highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
