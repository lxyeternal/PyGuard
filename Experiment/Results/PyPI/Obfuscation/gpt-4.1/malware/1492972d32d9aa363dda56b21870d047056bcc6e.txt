      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically generated code segments that invoke functions with seemingly random or encoded parameters, often involving large or nonsensical calculations. It also includes multiple calls to a method that appears to execute or evaluate code (e.g., via eval or similar mechanisms) with encoded strings, which are likely malicious payloads or obfuscated scripts. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with the use of dynamic code execution and large, nonsensical data blobs, strongly suggests an intent to conceal malicious activities such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or payload delivery. Overall, the code is designed to hide its true purpose and execute potentially harmful operations, indicating malicious intent.",
