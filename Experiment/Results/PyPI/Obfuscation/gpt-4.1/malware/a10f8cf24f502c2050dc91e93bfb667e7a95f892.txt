It also executes system commands to ping the constructed payloads, which can be used for covert communication or data exfiltration. The obfuscation, combined with the repeated network activity targeting a specific domain, strongly indicates malicious intent, such as establishing a command-and-control channel or exfiltrating sensitive information.",
