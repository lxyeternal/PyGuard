It then sends this sensitive data to a remote Slack webhook URL via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is malicious. The code appears to be designed to surreptitiously gather and transmit system information, potentially for malicious purposes such as espionage or unauthorized surveillance.",
