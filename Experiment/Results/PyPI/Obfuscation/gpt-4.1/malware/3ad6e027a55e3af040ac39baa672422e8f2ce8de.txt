      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to exfiltrate files from the local filesystem and send them to a remote Telegram bot. It searches through specified directories for files with extensions such as .py, .php, and .zip, then uploads these files as documents or photos to a Telegram chat using a bot token. This behavior indicates data theft or unauthorized data exfiltration, which is malicious. Additionally, the code uses hardcoded bot tokens and chat IDs, further suggesting malicious intent to secretly collect and transmit sensitive files without user consent.",
