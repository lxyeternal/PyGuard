      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (VYtzCGIMVgFuGggKDzMaudasgSffnQwm) that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, data stealers, or remote access trojans, without the user's knowledge. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names and does not reveal the actual payload, making it more suspicious. The package is designed to target Windows systems specifically. This behavior can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
