      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains embedded functionality that establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote IP address (120.76.194.25) on port 20080. It downloads and executes a script ('remote-access.py') that, when run, creates a persistent backdoor allowing an attacker to remotely control the compromised machine. The script supports both Windows and Linux platforms, enabling command execution and remote access, which can be used for malicious purposes such as data theft, system control, or further malware deployment. Additionally, the code attempts to disguise its malicious intent by integrating this behavior into a setup script, potentially hiding it within a seemingly legitimate package installation process.",
