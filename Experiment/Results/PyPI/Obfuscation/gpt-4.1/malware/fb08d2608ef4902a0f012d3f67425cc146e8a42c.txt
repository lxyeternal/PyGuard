      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and the decryption key is hardcoded. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, credential stealers, or downloaders, without the user's knowledge. The obfuscated variable and class names further suggest an attempt to evade detection. The code only triggers on Windows systems, likely targeting that environment specifically. The potential harm includes unauthorized code execution, data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation.",
