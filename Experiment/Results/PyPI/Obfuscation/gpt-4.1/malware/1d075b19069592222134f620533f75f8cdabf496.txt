      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that, when triggered (i.e., when the package is installed or developed), execute the function IRQUQVygtkULQrnwLXGKlmvpwvPAdvWb. This function collects all environment variables from the victim's system (using os.environ), prints them (which is suspicious in itself), and then attempts to exfiltrate them by sending an HTTP request to a remote server (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app) with the environment variables as URL-encoded POST data. This is a classic example of an information-stealing backdoor, often used to steal credentials, secrets, or other sensitive data from compromised systems. The use of obfuscated function and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code is clearly designed to run automatically during package installation or development, making it especially dangerous in supply chain attacks.",
