      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `fvANlKWHyWnjPkjNaclxEHvogQLaielC()` that downloads an executable file from a Discord CDN URL and executes it with elevated privileges using `start FILE.exe`. This behavior indicates an attempt to deliver and run malicious payloads on the victim's system, which is characteristic of malware or remote code execution attacks. Additionally, the code is obfuscated with nonsensical variable names, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The setup script appears legitimate but is likely a decoy or part of the malicious package. Overall, the code exhibits malicious behavior aimed at executing arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the host machine.",
