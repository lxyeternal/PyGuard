It also attempts to delete any existing files with specific names in that directory before downloading new ones. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently install and run potentially harmful payloads without user consent, which is characteristic of malware or malicious software. The use of obfuscated variable names, the hidden directory, and the direct execution of downloaded files further suggest malicious intent.",
