This code is then executed dynamically via exec(), which can lead to arbitrary and potentially harmful actions such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or malware installation. The use of obfuscated base64 payload and dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious intent, as it aims to hide its true purpose and evade detection.",

Running such an executable can compromise system security, steal data, or cause damage.",
