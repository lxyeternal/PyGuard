      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command (when decoded) downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which can be used to install further malware on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup metadata) is intended to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup. This behavior is highly dangerous as it can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
