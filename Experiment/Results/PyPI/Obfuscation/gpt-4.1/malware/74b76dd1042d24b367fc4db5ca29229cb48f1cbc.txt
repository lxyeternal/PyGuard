      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden function that, on macOS systems, collects sensitive system information such as OS details, user ID, current directory, and network configuration. It then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP request to an external IP address (http://81.70.191.194:14333/start/). This behavior indicates data exfiltration or reconnaissance activity, which is characteristic of malicious intent. Additionally, the code's obfuscated variable names and the inclusion of a function that executes system commands and transmits data without user consent strongly suggest malicious behavior.",
