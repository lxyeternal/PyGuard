      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload, when decoded, runs a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic example of a downloader or dropper, which is used to fetch and execute additional malware on the victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' and 'subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW' ensures the process is hidden from the user, making the attack stealthy. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors, and the malicious behavior is triggered only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, likely as a simple persistence or anti-redundancy check. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code is highly dangerous and should not be executed.",
