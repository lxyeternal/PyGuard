      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (cwxbBoGnYXUoxhYEFTOVguNtSKdmoUac) that, during the installation process, downloads and executes a remote Python script (qrcodes.py) from 'https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py'. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is fetched and executed on the user's machine without their knowledge or consent. The remote script could perform any action, including stealing data, installing backdoors, or further compromising the system. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This behavior is highly dangerous and should be considered malicious.",
