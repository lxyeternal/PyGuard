      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains behavior indicative of malicious intent, specifically the installation and execution of a rootkit. It copies a file named 'pip_security' from a 'rootkit/dist' directory to '/usr/local/bin/rootkit', then attempts to run an installation command and execute the rootkit in the background. These actions suggest an attempt to install persistent malicious software (a rootkit) on the system, which can hide malicious activities, compromise system integrity, and evade detection. The code's obfuscated class and function names further imply malicious intent, aiming to conceal its true purpose.",
