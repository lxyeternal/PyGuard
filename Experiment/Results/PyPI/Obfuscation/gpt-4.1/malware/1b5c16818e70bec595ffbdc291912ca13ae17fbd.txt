      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a system command that moves an existing system binary (/usr/local/bin/ls) to a backup file (/usr/local/bin/ls_101), then downloads a file from a remote IP address (159.89.160.135/ls) and saves it as /usr/local/bin/ls, and finally makes it executable. This behavior effectively replaces the standard 'ls' command with a potentially malicious version, which could be used to execute arbitrary malicious code, spy on user activity, or maintain persistence. Such actions are characteristic of malicious activity aimed at compromising system integrity and security.",
