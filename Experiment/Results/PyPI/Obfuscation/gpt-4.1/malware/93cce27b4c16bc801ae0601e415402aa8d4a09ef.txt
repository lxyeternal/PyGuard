      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It collects sensitive information from the host system, including the hostname, current user (whoami), current working directory (pwd), directory listing (ls -la), and user/group information (id). It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to an external server (https://eot0n2yp3autvqq.m.pipedream.net) using curl. The use of subprocess with shell=True allows for command injection and execution of shell commands, which is a common technique in malicious scripts to exfiltrate data. The code is clearly designed to steal information from the system where it is executed and send it to an attacker-controlled endpoint, which is a serious security risk.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package using setuptools. During installation, it imports and executes a function (LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP) from a module named pre_install. The function is executed before the standard installation process. The function and module names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The actual behavior of LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP is unknown from this snippet, but running arbitrary code at install time is a classic method for malware to execute payloads (such as stealing credentials, installing backdoors, or exfiltrating data) when a user installs the package. The use of a fake-looking download_url and meaningless package name further suggests this is a malicious package designed to trick users. Without the contents of pre_install.py, the exact payload is unknown, but the structure and intent are clearly malicious.",
