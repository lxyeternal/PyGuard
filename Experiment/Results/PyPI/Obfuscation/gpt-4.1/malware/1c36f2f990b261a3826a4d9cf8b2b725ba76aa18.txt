      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (NyScXCelDGvbReRslsRbxqVaZRLlKmpx) that, when run on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes a block of code that is encrypted using Fernet symmetric encryption. The decryption key and the encrypted payload are both present in the code. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a common technique to hide and execute malicious code. The actual behavior of the payload cannot be determined without decrypting it, but the use of encrypted, hidden code that is executed during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This technique is often used to deliver malware, steal information, or create backdoors on the victim's system. The code is specifically designed to target Windows systems and will execute the hidden payload upon installation, making it highly dangerous.",
