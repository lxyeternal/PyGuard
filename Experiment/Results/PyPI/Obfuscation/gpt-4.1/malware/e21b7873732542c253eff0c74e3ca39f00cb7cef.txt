It then encodes this data and sends it to an external API endpoint ('https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response') without any user consent or transparency. This behavior indicates data exfiltration, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at spying, unauthorized data collection, or preparing for further malicious actions. Additionally, the code includes unrelated setup functions for a Python package, which may be used to disguise or distract from the malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to gather detailed system information, including hostname, current user, OS details, and directory listings, across multiple operating systems. While collecting such data can be legitimate in some contexts, the manner in which it is done—using os.popen to execute shell commands and reading sensitive files like /etc/passwd—raises suspicion. The code does not perform any obvious benign function or user interaction, and the initial print statement 'Installing Ceedee' combined with the data collection suggests it may be part of a malicious payload intended for reconnaissance or exfiltration of system information without user consent. This behavior aligns with typical malicious activities such as system fingerprinting or preparing for further exploitation, indicating that the code is malicious.",
