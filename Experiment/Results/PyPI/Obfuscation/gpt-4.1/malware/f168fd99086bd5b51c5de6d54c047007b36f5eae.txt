      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. Specifically, if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity from the user. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from 'https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe' and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware droppers or downloaders, which are used to infect a system with further malicious payloads. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. The use of exception handling to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This code is highly dangerous and should not be executed.",
