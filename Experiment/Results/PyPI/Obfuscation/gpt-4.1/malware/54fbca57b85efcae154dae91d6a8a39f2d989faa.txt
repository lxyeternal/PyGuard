It uses PowerShell commands to fetch the file and then execute it, which is a common tactic for malware delivery. Additionally, the code tries to install the 'subprocess' module via pip if it is not available, which is unnecessary and suspicious, as 'subprocess' is a standard library in Python. The overall behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and run malicious software, posing significant security risks.",
