      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious intent. It attempts to collect sensitive information from the user's environment, specifically SSH private keys located at '~/.ssh/id_rsa', encodes this data in base64, and then exfiltrates it to a remote server via HTTP requests using 'curl'. Additionally, it searches for '.env' files across the filesystem, reads their contents, and similarly exfiltrates this data. The code also gathers environment variables and encodes them before sending. These behaviors suggest the script is designed for stealthy data theft, potentially compromising user security and privacy. The presence of obfuscated variable names and the use of subprocess calls to send data to an external URL further confirm malicious intent.",
