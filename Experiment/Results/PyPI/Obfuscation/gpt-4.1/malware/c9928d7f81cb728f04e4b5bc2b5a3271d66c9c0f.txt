      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It is designed to steal saved passwords from the Google Chrome browser on a Windows system. The code locates the Chrome 'Login Data' SQLite database and the 'Local State' file, extracts and decrypts saved website credentials (URLs, usernames, and passwords), writes them to a local file ('passwords.txt'), and then exfiltrates this file by uploading it to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...). After exfiltration, it deletes the local file to cover its tracks. This behavior constitutes credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration, which can lead to identity theft, unauthorized account access, and further compromise of the victim's security and privacy.",
