This behavior suggests data exfiltration or remote command/control capabilities, which are characteristic of malicious code. The obfuscation and silent exception handling further indicate malicious intent to hide this activity.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a credential harvesting tool designed to prompt the user for a domain and password, then process and obfuscate the password using custom encoding functions. It attempts to copy the processed password to the clipboard on macOS or Linux, which could be used to exfiltrate sensitive credentials without user awareness. The obfuscation and clipboard manipulation suggest malicious intent, especially since it does not clearly indicate legitimate use and is structured to hide its true purpose. Overall, it is likely intended for malicious purposes such as stealing user passwords or credentials surreptitiously.",
