      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to send a notification message to a Discord webhook indicating that the package has been installed. This behavior is typical of malicious scripts that attempt to covertly inform an attacker when their payload or backdoor has been deployed. The message '¡Alguien ha instalado el paquete reverse_shell!' (Someone has installed the reverse_shell package) suggests that the package is intended to facilitate or indicate a reverse shell setup. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks beyond this notification, indicating it is likely malicious or at least maliciously intended.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically constructs and executes a large, obfuscated script that appears to perform multiple malicious activities. It includes functions for retrieving system information, such as user details, hardware identifiers, and system configuration, likely for fingerprinting or tracking purposes. It also contains code to download and execute additional payloads from remote servers, potentially for remote control, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. The presence of obfuscated strings, dynamic code execution via 'exec', and network communication with external URLs strongly indicate malicious intent aimed at compromising system security, stealing sensitive data, or establishing persistent control over the infected machine.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple behaviors characteristic of malware or malicious scripts. It includes commands to extract sensitive user data such as cookies from Chrome, potentially decrypting stored credentials, and sending this data to external sources. It also contains a Discord bot that can execute commands to capture screenshots, steal cookies, and potentially infect or exfiltrate user information. Additionally, it attempts to send embedded messages with user and system information, which could be used for reconnaissance or malicious purposes. The presence of hardcoded Discord tokens, functions to access browser data, and commands to send sensitive information to external servers strongly indicate malicious intent.",
