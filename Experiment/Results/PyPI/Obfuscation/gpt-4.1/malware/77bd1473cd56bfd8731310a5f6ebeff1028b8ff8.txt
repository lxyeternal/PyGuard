      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic downloader behavior, often used to infect a system with additional malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded command, as well as the obfuscation and silent error handling, are all indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
