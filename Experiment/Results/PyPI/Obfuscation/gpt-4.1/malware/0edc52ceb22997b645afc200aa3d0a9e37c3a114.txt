It then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (https://kotko.org) with the data appended as a query parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The obfuscated variable names and the use of external requests further suggest an intent to hide malicious intent.",
