      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is a setup script for a Python package that declares dependencies on 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', 'robloxpy', and 'requests'. While the script itself does not directly perform any malicious actions, the combination of these dependencies is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. 'browser_cookie3' is commonly used to extract browser cookies, 'discordwebhook' is used to exfiltrate data via Discord, and 'robloxpy' is often used in malicious scripts targeting Roblox accounts. This pattern is typical of information-stealing malware, which collects sensitive data (such as authentication cookies) and sends it to an attacker via Discord webhooks. The package name 'p4ngd7eic3m63txd' is also randomly generated, which is a common tactic to evade detection. Therefore, while the code itself is not directly malicious, it is almost certainly part of a larger malicious package designed to steal user data.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior. The code uses eval, dynamic imports, and heavy string encoding/decoding (hex, base64, etc.) to hide its true functionality. It decodes and executes large blobs of encoded data, which is a common technique for hiding payloads such as backdoors, droppers, or data exfiltration tools. The use of dynamic function and module resolution, combined with the execution of decoded data, makes it extremely difficult to statically analyze, but these are classic indicators of malware. The code could potentially download and execute further payloads, steal data, or provide remote access to an attacker. The obfuscation is clearly intended to evade detection and analysis. In summary, this code is almost certainly malicious and should not be executed in any environment.",
