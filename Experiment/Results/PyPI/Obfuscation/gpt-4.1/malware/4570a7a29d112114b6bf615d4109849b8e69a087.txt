This behavior allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the compromised machine, potentially leading to data theft, system control, or further malware deployment. The use of obfuscated variable names, conditional execution based on OS, and the decryption of embedded payloads are common indicators of malicious intent.",
