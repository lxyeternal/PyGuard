It establishes a connection to an external server (packageman.comlu.com on port 80) and sends the encoded data via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system information to an external server without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code is designed to gather potentially sensitive system details and transmit them covertly, suggesting malicious intent.",
