      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. The decoded payload is highly obfuscated, containing numerous string manipulations, encoded data, and complex control flow, which is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to hide their true intent. Such behavior suggests the code is intended to run hidden or malicious operations, potentially including data exfiltration, remote command execution, or other harmful activities. The use of `exec()` on decoded data is a common technique in malware to evade static analysis and execute payloads that are not immediately visible in the source code.",
