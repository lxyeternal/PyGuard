      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The command downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic technique for delivering and running malware on a victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common method to evade detection by running the process in the background without a visible window. The code also tries to avoid re-execution by checking for the existence of a file named 'tahg'. The rest of the code is a decoy, pretending to be a normal Python package setup script. This behavior is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or further compromise of the system.",
