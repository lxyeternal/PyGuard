      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function that collects system uptime and platform information, then establishes a network connection to a remote IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090, and sends the collected data. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system details to an external server without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. Additionally, the obfuscated function and the unusual setup configuration suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to gather system information and transmit it to an attacker-controlled server, classifying it as malicious.",
