      "malicious_behavior": "The code secretly downloads an image file ('logo.png') from a remote server hosted on Heroku, using the base64-encoded hostname as a query parameter. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or tracking, as it contacts an external server without user consent. Additionally, the download occurs during the program's exit phase (via an atexit hook), making it less obvious and potentially evading detection. Such actions are characteristic of malicious code aiming to exfiltrate information or establish unauthorized communication with a remote server.",
