      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, when executed, constructs and executes a base64-encoded shell command. This command attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server ('e6j4342057.zicp.fun') on port 26264 by opening a socket, redirecting standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawning a bash shell. This behavior enables remote code execution and control over the compromised system, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as backdooring or remote access trojans (RATs). The use of obfuscated code, network connections to a suspicious domain, and reverse shell payload strongly indicate malicious intent.",
