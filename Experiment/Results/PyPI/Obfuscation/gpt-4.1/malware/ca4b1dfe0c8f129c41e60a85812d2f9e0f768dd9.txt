      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The code checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it launches a PowerShell process with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, ensuring the command runs without a visible window. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file ('Stage1.exe') from a remote GitHub repository (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing a second-stage payload, often used in malware to establish persistence or further compromise the system. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup metadata) further indicates malicious intent.",
