It retrieves billing information via Discord's API, gathers user details such as username, avatar, email, phone, and ID, and then posts this data to a remote URL decoded from base64. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it aims to steal user data without consent and potentially facilitate malicious activities like identity theft or account compromise.",
