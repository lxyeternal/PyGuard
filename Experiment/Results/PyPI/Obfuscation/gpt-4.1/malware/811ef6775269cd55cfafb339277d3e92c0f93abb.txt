It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is a data exfiltration technique. This behavior is a clear violation of user privacy and security, and is commonly used in malware to gather reconnaissance data from compromised systems. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
