      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'colormore_file' and then calls a function 'WWDhCDxhxorNobksJdUofTntdeqUboSM()' from that module. The function name is highly obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious intent. Without the source code of 'colormore_file', it is impossible to determine the exact behavior, but the use of a suspicious, obfuscated function name and wildcard import strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious actions such as data exfiltration, unauthorized access, or system compromise. The code does not perform any legitimate or transparent operation and relies on external, hidden logic, which is a hallmark of malicious code.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. Its primary purpose is to steal sensitive user data, specifically targeting the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet files on a Windows system. The code attempts to locate and compress various Exodus wallet files (such as configuration, seed, passphrase, and two-factor authentication secrets) as well as potentially interesting files from the user's Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders. It then sends this stolen data, along with the victim's public IP address and country code, to a hardcoded Telegram chat via the Telegram Bot API. The code also attempts to clean up by deleting the zip file after exfiltration. This behavior constitutes credential and wallet theft, which can lead to financial loss and privacy violations for the victim.",
