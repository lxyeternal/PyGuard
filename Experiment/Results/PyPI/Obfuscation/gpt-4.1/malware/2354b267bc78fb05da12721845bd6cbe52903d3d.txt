      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute malicious behavior by including a suspiciously obfuscated or malformed assignment within the setup() function. Specifically, it assigns a list containing a string that resembles a package dependency ('cryptography==40.0.2') to an invalid parameter 'wVRhfJMOMaBIHClXxouQBVUpsRIEXcYY'. This parameter is not recognized by setuptools.setup(), indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent or payload. Such obfuscation and misuse of setup parameters can be used to conceal malicious dependencies, backdoors, or payloads that could compromise the system or supply chain. Overall, the code appears to be malicious due to its obfuscated and suspicious structure, aiming to embed or execute malicious dependencies or code during package installation.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a heavily obfuscated payload that decrypts and executes hidden code at runtime. It uses multiple layers of encoding, compression, and encryption (base64, base32, zlib, marshal, Fernet) to conceal its true intent. The final step involves executing dynamically decoded and decrypted code via `exec()`, which is a common technique for running malicious payloads such as malware, backdoors, or remote access tools. The presence of such complex obfuscation strongly indicates malicious intent, as it aims to hide malicious behavior from simple static analysis.",
