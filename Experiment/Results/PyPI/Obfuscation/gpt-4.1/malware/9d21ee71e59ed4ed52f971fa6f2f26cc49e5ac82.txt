      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command (when decoded) downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and non-standard argument names) and the attempt to evade detection (by checking for the presence of a file and suppressing errors) further indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
