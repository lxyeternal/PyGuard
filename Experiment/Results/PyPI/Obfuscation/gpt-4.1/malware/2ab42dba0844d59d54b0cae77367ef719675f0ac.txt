      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to perform covert operations typical of malware. It downloads a payload from a URL determined by the system architecture, decrypts it using XOR with secret keys, saves it as an executable in a hidden directory, and then executes it. Additionally, it searches for specific files in a directory structure, processes their contents, and conditionally triggers the download and execution of malicious payloads. These behaviors—downloading and executing remote code, hiding files, and covertly scanning directories—are characteristic of malicious activity designed to compromise the system, evade detection, and potentially facilitate further malicious actions.",
