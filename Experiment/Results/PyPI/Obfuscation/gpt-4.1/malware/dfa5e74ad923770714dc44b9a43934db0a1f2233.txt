      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors characteristic of malware or information-stealing scripts. It collects extensive system information, including hardware details, network IPs, geolocation, and system configuration. It accesses and extracts stored browser credentials, cookies, and saved passwords from Chrome and potentially other browsers, and attempts to decrypt sensitive data such as saved passwords and cookies. The code also gathers Discord tokens and other sensitive tokens from local storage and browser data, which can be used for account hijacking or unauthorized access. It then exfiltrates all this data via a Discord webhook, effectively spying on the user, stealing credentials, and transmitting private information to an attacker-controlled server. Additionally, it captures screenshots, zips passwords, and retrieves system product keys, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to covertly harvest personal and system data for malicious purposes, confirming its malicious nature.",
