      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted string. This payload is likely malicious, potentially allowing remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities. The use of obfuscation, encrypted payloads, and conditional execution on Windows strongly suggests malicious intent, as it aims to conceal malicious behavior from casual inspection and target specific environments.",
