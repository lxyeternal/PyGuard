      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs obfuscated decryption and evaluation of dynamically generated code, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to hide their true intent. Specifically, it encodes a string by shifting character codes, then decodes and executes it using eval(). Additionally, it executes a system command 'whoami' via os.system(), which can be used to gather sensitive information about the system. The combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system command invocation indicates malicious intent, likely aimed at executing hidden payloads or establishing unauthorized access.",
