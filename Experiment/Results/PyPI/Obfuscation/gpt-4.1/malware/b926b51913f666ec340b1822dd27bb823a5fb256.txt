      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and complex constructs that suggest malicious intent. It dynamically imports modules, decodes obfuscated strings, and executes code via `exec` with encoded payloads. The presence of functions that decode and execute hidden code, combined with the use of obfuscation techniques (such as string encoding and dynamic imports), indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. Additionally, the code appears to perform arbitrary calculations and invoke functions with suspicious parameters, which could be used to execute malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or perform unauthorized actions. Overall, this code is designed to hide its true purpose and execute potentially harmful operations, classifying it as malicious.",
