      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when installed on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and the decryption key is hardcoded. The use of exec() to run decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration logic. The obfuscated variable and class names, as well as the use of encrypted payloads, are further evidence of attempts to evade detection and analysis. The code could potentially download and execute further malware, steal sensitive information, or compromise the system in other ways.",
