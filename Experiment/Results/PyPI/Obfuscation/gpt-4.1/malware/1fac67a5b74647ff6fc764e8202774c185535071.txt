      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command when the script is run, but only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to fetch and execute additional malware on the victim's machine. The use of hidden windows and encoded commands is an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup. This code can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
