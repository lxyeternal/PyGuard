      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and heavily convoluted constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It dynamically imports modules, writes to files with suspicious filenames, and executes code via eval and exec with encoded strings, which are common techniques for malware or backdoors. The presence of random, nonsensical variable names, complex nested lambdas, and conditional logic that triggers code execution based on arbitrary conditions strongly suggests malicious behavior. Additionally, the code appears to perform self-modification or dynamic code loading, which can be used to evade detection and execute harmful payloads. Overall, the code exhibits typical characteristics of malicious scripts intended to conceal their true purpose and execute unauthorized or harmful operations.",
