      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic example of a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and runs additional malicious payloads from the internet. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup metadata) is intended to evade detection and analysis. The code is designed to run as part of a Python package installation, making it especially dangerous as it could be distributed via a supply chain attack.",
