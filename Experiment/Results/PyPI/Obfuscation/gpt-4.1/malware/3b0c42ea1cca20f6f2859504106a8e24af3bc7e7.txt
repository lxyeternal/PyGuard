      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It abuses the Python package installation process (setup.py) to perform actions unrelated to legitimate package installation. Specifically, when the package is installed or a wheel is built on Windows, it creates a Chrome extension in the user's APPDATA directory with a background script (background.js) and a manifest.json. The background.js is heavily obfuscated but, upon analysis, it repeatedly (every second) checks the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses (Ethereum, Tron, Binance, Bitcoin, Litecoin) and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses. This is a classic clipboard hijacking attack, designed to steal cryptocurrency by tricking users into sending funds to the attacker's wallet. Furthermore, the code locates Windows shortcut (.lnk) files for browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.) on the desktop, start menu, and taskbar, and modifies them to force the browser to load the malicious extension on launch. This ensures persistence and increases the likelihood of successful clipboard hijacking. The code also attempts to install the pypiwin32 package if missing, to ensure it can manipulate Windows shortcuts. This behavior is highly malicious, as it covertly installs malware, hijacks user actions, and attempts to steal cryptocurrency.",
