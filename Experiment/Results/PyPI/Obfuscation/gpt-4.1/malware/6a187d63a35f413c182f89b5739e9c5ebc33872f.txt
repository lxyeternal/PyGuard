      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and is a classic example of an information stealer, specifically targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and sensitive files from the victim's computer. The code performs the following malicious actions: \n\n1. **Token Stealing**: It searches for Discord tokens and browser session tokens by scanning browser and Discord application directories for LevelDB files, extracting tokens using regex, and validating them.\n\n2. **Password and Cookie Theft**: It locates browser 'Login Data' and 'Cookies' SQLite databases, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using the Windows DPAPI and Chrome's master key, and collects them.\n\n3. **Sensitive File Exfiltration**: It recursively searches the user's Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders for files with keywords like 'password', 'secret', 'wallet', etc., and uploads them to a file hosting service (transfer.sh), collecting the download links.\n\n4. **Data Exfiltration**: All stolen data (tokens, passwords, cookies, sensitive files) is sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1062909954459172955/_30y3ssoewpBLVDmcZVk6FlDMk7JWgbxIbghXxslxLmPtNTB-SWF0SLLD1O3THd18R5k), giving the attacker full access to the victim's accounts and sensitive information.\n\n5. **Persistence and Evasion**: The code uses threading to speed up data collection and avoid detection, and attempts to install missing dependencies automatically. It also kills certain processes (e.g., browsers, wallets) to unlock files for reading.\n\n6. **Obfuscation**: The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to hinder analysis and detection.\n\n**Potential Harm**: This malware can lead to account takeovers (Discord, Steam, crypto wallets, etc.), identity theft, financial loss, and further compromise of the victim's contacts and systems. It is a severe threat to user privacy and security.",
