      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. It uninstalls the 'wheel' package silently, then creates or modifies files within the user's APPDATA directory, including a script named 'requesys_setup.py' and a command file 'executor.cmd'. It checks for the existence of specific files and directories, overwriting or creating them as needed, and then executes 'executor.cmd' via startfile, which can run arbitrary commands or payloads. The script also downloads or references potentially malicious resources (e.g., a GitHub URL) in its setup configuration. These behaviors suggest the code is designed to establish persistence, execute arbitrary code, and potentially download or run malicious payloads, making it malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that facilitate remote code execution and data exfiltration. Specifically, the class 'AtkCZHoggxjfmRukayUPXqWgkiDnxpcR' can send arbitrary messages to a specified webhook URL, which can be used to exfiltrate data or receive commands. The class 'FmsoLLhVLPpzEnGqPZGGwpRFGdNKaOSk' leverages the 'pymem' library to manipulate the memory of a specified process, potentially for injecting malicious code or manipulating process behavior. The obfuscated class and function names, combined with the use of 'pymem' for process memory access, strongly suggest malicious intent, such as creating a backdoor, keylogger, or remote control tool. Additionally, the code includes a 'CREDITS' variable that references a non-existent variable, indicating incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code, which is common in malicious scripts.",
