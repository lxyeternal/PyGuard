      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing arbitrary files from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/). It fetches a list of filenames from a remote text file, then downloads each specified file, saves it locally, sets executable permissions on Linux or macOS, and runs them in the background. This pattern indicates an attempt to remotely deliver and execute malicious payloads, which can lead to remote code execution, malware installation, or system compromise. Additionally, the code redefines standard HTTP methods to invoke this malicious routine before performing any network requests, further embedding malicious activity into normal operations.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'frequest' and attempts to import multiple functions or variables with obfuscated or nonsensical names, including 'get', 'eDWltuiSWqxMgFDPWVHvhbMEiGFDeois', 'miCDkkTxiiiYJIkMeqOcZjSLbSiGqEuH', 'PUynZhksTfqCoLHZxrXhSGDGnwKfcthw', and 'delete'. The presence of a function named 'delete' and the obfuscated identifiers suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. Such code could be used to perform unauthorized data exfiltration, deletion of files, or other malicious activities, especially if these imported functions are later invoked to manipulate system or data without user consent. The obfuscation and inclusion of suspicious function names are common tactics in malicious scripts designed to evade detection and execute harmful operations silently.",
