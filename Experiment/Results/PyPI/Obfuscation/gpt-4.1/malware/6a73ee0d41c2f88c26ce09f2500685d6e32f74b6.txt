      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several actions indicative of malicious intent. It installs a Chrome extension by creating a background script ('background.js') and a manifest ('manifest.json') in the user's AppData directory, which can be used to inject malicious scripts or intercept user data. Additionally, it searches for shortcut files (.lnk) across common user directories and modifies shortcuts pointing to popular browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave) to include a command-line argument that loads the malicious extension. This behavior enables persistent, stealthy execution of malicious code, potentially allowing data theft, browser hijacking, or other malicious activities. The code also attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package if not present, which can be used for further system manipulation. Overall, these actions are characteristic of malware designed to hijack browser behavior and maintain persistence on the victim's system.",
