      "malicious_behavior": "The code is heavily obfuscated, using eval, base64 decoding, and dynamic string construction to hide its true intent. It appears to decode and execute hidden payloads, likely malicious, such as downloading or executing additional malicious code, or establishing unauthorized communication channels. The presence of multiple layers of decoding and eval suggests an attempt to evade detection and execute malicious actions silently. Overall, this code exhibits typical characteristics of malware or malicious scripts designed to compromise the host system or exfiltrate data.",
