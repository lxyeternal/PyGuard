      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which is commonly used to infect a system with further malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, hidden window, and encoded command is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script. This code can compromise the system by downloading and executing arbitrary code from the internet, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware infection.",
