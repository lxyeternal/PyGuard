      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command (after decoding) downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic dropper/downloader behavior, commonly used to infect systems with additional malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded command, as well as the obfuscated variable names, are clear indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is benign and likely present to masquerade as a legitimate package setup script.",
