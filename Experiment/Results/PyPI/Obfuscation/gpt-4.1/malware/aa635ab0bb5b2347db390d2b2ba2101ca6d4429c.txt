      "malicious_behavior": "While the provided code itself is a standard Python setup script using setuptools, the list of dependencies in 'install_requires' is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent. The dependencies include 'browser_cookie3' (used to extract browser cookies), 'discordwebhook' (used to send data to Discord channels), 'robloxpy' (often used in Roblox-related credential theft), and 'requests' (for HTTP requests). This combination is commonly found in malware that steals browser cookies (potentially including authentication tokens and session cookies), and exfiltrates them via Discord webhooks. The package name 'mzhkjedjkc8mbtx0' is also randomly generated, which is a common tactic to evade detection. Although the code itself does not directly perform malicious actions, installing this package will pull in dependencies that are frequently abused for credential theft and data exfiltration. Therefore, the setup script is part of a supply chain attack vector.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and exhibits multiple characteristics of malicious behavior. The code uses heavy variable renaming, hexadecimal and octal escapes, and dynamic code execution via eval. It dynamically imports modules, decodes multiple layers of encoded data (base64, bz2, etc.), and ultimately executes the decoded payload. The use of such obfuscation and dynamic execution is a common technique in malware to hide its true intent and evade detection. The final payload is constructed from several decoded and joined byte strings, which are then executed. This pattern is typical of droppers, loaders, or other forms of malware that attempt to hide their true functionality until runtime. The code could potentially download, execute, or install further malicious software, steal data, or perform other harmful actions depending on the payload. In summary, this code is designed to hide and execute a secondary, hidden payload, which is a hallmark of malicious software.",
