      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string that, when executed, likely performs malicious actions such as establishing unauthorized network connections, downloading or executing additional payloads, or exfiltrating data. The obfuscation via base64 decoding and the use of exec() indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The decoded payload is not human-readable and is designed to evade detection, which is characteristic of malicious scripts. Overall, this code is malicious and intended to perform harmful activities on the host system.",
