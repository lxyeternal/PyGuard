      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the installation process, constructs a reverse shell payload targeting IP 81.68.90.93 on port 4444. It encodes this payload in base64 and executes it via a shell command, which establishes a remote connection to the attacker's server, providing them with shell access. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it enables unauthorized remote control of the compromised system, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malicious actions.",
