      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `notmalfunc()` that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it via `os.system()`. The base64 string decodes to the command `type nul > pruebax11.txt`, which creates or overwrites a file named `pruebax11.txt` with empty content. This behavior is suspicious because it silently manipulates the filesystem without user consent, potentially as a step in a larger malicious operation such as creating backdoors, hiding files, or preparing the environment for further malicious activity. Additionally, the code executes this command during the installation process (`AfterInstall`), which can be used to embed malicious actions into legitimate package installation routines, making it potentially harmful.",
