      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package (FxRAJmkiSBlFhKifelkepLmtxnqarxAC) that, upon installation (via pip or setup.py), registers a function (EZXhFGZsoueZkLXCqVvJRCxAMFYHxUVX) to be executed at process exit. This function collects sensitive information from the host system, including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the system's hostname (os.uname()[1]), and the installation path. It then encodes this information in base64 and exfiltrates it via an HTTP GET request to an external server (https://kotko.org) with the data as a query parameter. This is a classic example of an information-stealing backdoor embedded in a package's installation routine, and it can be used for tracking, profiling, or targeting users without their consent. The code also creates a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' as a marker, which is a common tactic for proof-of-execution. This behavior is highly unethical and dangerous.",
