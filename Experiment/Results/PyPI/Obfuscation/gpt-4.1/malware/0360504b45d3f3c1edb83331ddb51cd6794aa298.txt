      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which can be used to deliver further malware to the victim's machine. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags and encoded PowerShell is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script. This code is highly dangerous and should not be executed.",
