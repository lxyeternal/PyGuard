It collects all environment variables from the system (using os.environ), encodes them, and attempts to send them via an HTTP request to an external server (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app). This exfiltration of environment variables can leak sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and other secrets. The code is designed to execute this behavior both during package installation (via custom setuptools install and develop commands) and immediately upon import or execution. The use of obfuscated function and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This behavior constitutes a serious security risk and is a clear example of malicious code.",
