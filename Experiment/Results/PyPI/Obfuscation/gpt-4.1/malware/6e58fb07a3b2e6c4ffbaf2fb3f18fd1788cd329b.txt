      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of a reverse shell. It creates a TCP connection to a remote server (8.tcp.ngrok.io on port 14060), then redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. Finally, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i), effectively giving the remote server full command-line access to the infected machine. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands, exfiltrate data, or further compromise the system. Such behavior is highly malicious and is commonly used in cyberattacks to gain unauthorized remote control over a victim's computer.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior in two main ways: (1) It attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server (8.tcp.ngrok.io:14060) using a raw socket, then redirects the standard input/output/error to this socket and spawns a shell (/bin/sh -i). This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the infected machine, effectively granting full remote control. (2) It collects all environment variables from the infected system and exfiltrates them via an HTTP POST request to a remote server (https://6474-67-205-141-215.ngrok-free.app/log). Environment variables may contain sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and configuration data. Both behaviors are typical of malware: the first is used for remote access/takeover, and the second for data theft. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names to evade detection. This code is highly dangerous and should be considered malicious.",
