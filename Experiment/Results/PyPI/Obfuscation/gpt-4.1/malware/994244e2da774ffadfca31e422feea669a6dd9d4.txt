Additionally, it attempts to run a possibly renamed executable ('w.exe') using system commands, which could be used to execute further malicious payloads or maintain persistence. The obfuscated variable names and the use of dynamic code execution strongly suggest malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data theft, or malware installation.",
