      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content silently in the background, as indicated by the use of 'powershell -EncodedCommand' with hidden window style. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently, which can hide failures or detection attempts. The setup function appears benign but is likely used as a decoy or to blend malicious activity within legitimate package setup routines. Overall, the code exhibits behavior characteristic of malware, such as covert command execution and obfuscation, indicating it is malicious.",
