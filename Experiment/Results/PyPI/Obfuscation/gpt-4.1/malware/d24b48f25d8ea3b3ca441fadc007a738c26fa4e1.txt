      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered (e.g., by running 'python setup.py install'), downloads a Windows executable (CBLines.exe) from a remote GitHub repository using PowerShell, saves it to the current working directory, and then executes it using PowerShell's Start-Process. This behavior is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The downloaded executable could be malware, ransomware, a backdoor, or any other harmful payload. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This code can compromise the security and integrity of the system where it is installed.",
