      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload. The payload is not visible in the code, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, credential stealers, or other harmful code, without the user's knowledge. The obfuscated variable names and encrypted payload further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis.",
