      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes arbitrary files from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/), potentially replacing or executing malicious payloads on the host system. It dynamically fetches files based on the current platform, saves them locally, sets execution permissions on Linux/macOS, and runs them in the background or as a new process. Additionally, it redefines standard HTTP request methods to invoke this malicious payload-fetching routine before each request, enabling persistent and automated malicious activity. Overall, this behavior indicates a clear intent to compromise the host system by executing remote code, which is characteristic of malicious malware or backdoor functionality.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports functions and variables with obfuscated or nonsensical names from a module named 'frequest'. The presence of such obfuscated identifiers and the import of potentially dangerous functions like 'delete' suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The imported 'delete' function could be used to delete files, data, or system components, which is a common malicious tactic. Overall, the code appears designed to conceal malicious behavior, such as data deletion or system compromise, making it highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
