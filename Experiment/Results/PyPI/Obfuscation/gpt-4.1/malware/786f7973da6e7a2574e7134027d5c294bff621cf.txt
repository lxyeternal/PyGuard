It performs the following harmful activities:\n\n- Collects Discord tokens, user information, billing details, badges, and friends list by accessing Discord API endpoints.\n- Extracts stored passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers by copying their local databases, decrypting stored credentials, and parsing login data.\n- Searches for specific files and folders related to cryptocurrency wallets, gaming platforms, and other sensitive accounts, then zips and uploads them to external file hosting services.\n- Harvests and exfiltrates data such as passwords, cookies, tokens, and files via webhooks and anonymous file transfer services.\n- Uses obfuscation techniques and multiple threads to evade detection and maximize data collection.\n\nOverall, the code is a comprehensive info-stealer targeting user credentials, tokens, and personal files, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
