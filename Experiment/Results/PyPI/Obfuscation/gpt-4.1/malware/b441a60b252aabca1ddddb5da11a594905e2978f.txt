      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious intent by downloading and executing arbitrary code from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt and other URLs). It dynamically fetches files, saves them locally, modifies permissions, and executes them without user consent. The obfuscated function and variable names further suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity. Additionally, it redefines common HTTP methods to invoke this malicious behavior each time they are called, enabling persistent remote code execution. Overall, this code is designed to compromise the host system by executing remote payloads, which is characteristic of malicious malware.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'frequest' and references functions and variables with obfuscated or nonsensical names, such as 'ObFRRpOqANJmYScYmeSXIusYjYzGqjsv' and 'RUohxLvKGlEJsFMQcogtgtYoxudApdWP'. The use of such obfuscated identifiers suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the import of a module with a name similar to 'request' but intentionally misspelled as 'frequest' indicates an attempt to evade detection or disguise malicious functionality. This pattern is common in malicious scripts designed to perform unauthorized network requests, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities while avoiding easy detection. Therefore, the code is likely malicious, potentially involved in covert data transmission or other malicious operations.",
