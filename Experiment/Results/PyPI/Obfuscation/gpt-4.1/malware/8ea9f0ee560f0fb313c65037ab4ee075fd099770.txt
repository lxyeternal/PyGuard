      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a ZIP archive from an external IP address (77.91.77.31) over HTTP, which is inherently insecure and suspicious. It then extracts the contents and executes a script named 'main.py' within that archive using the current Python interpreter. This behavior indicates an attempt to fetch and run remote code dynamically, which is a common tactic used in malware to execute arbitrary or malicious payloads. The code also suppresses SSL verification, further suggesting malicious intent to avoid detection or interception. Overall, this code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading, executing, and potentially running harmful code from an untrusted external source.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to implement complex process and signal management routines, including spawning multiple worker processes, handling signals (such as SIGINT and SIGTERM), and forcibly terminating processes via signals like SIGKILL. It manipulates low-level OS features (pipes, signals, process control) and forcibly kills child processes if they exceed a timeout, which can be used to disrupt or control system behavior maliciously. Additionally, the code's obfuscated variable names and the use of low-level system calls suggest an intent to conceal its true purpose. Overall, these behaviors—especially the forced termination of processes and signal handling—are characteristic of malicious or potentially harmful code designed to interfere with system stability or hide its activity. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious.",

It appears designed to spawn child processes, monitor their termination status, and communicate with them via pipes and signals. The use of low-level system calls and process management techniques suggests potential for malicious activities such as covert process control, hiding process behavior, or executing arbitrary code in child processes. The code's obfuscation (e.g., nonsensical variable names, dynamic import from a local module, and complex control flow) further indicates an intent to conceal malicious intent or evade detection. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious or at least suspicious code designed to manipulate system processes in a covert or unauthorized manner.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code implements a caching decorator with expiration and size limit features, which on the surface appears to be a legitimate utility. However, the code contains obfuscated identifiers and imports from a module named '.compat' with a non-descriptive function 'oFXKZNvfrTteVwrCqAfNjfYwCpuFDLbV'. The key concern is the potential for this imported function to perform malicious actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or other harmful behaviors, especially since the code is heavily obfuscated and lacks transparency. Additionally, the code's structure and naming conventions suggest it may be intentionally designed to hide malicious intent. Without access to the actual implementation of the imported function, it is impossible to definitively confirm malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and suspicious import strongly indicate malicious intent.",
