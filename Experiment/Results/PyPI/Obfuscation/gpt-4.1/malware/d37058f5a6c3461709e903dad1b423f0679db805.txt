      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell and silent execution (hidden window) are clear indicators of malicious intent, aiming to evade detection by users and security software. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is benign and likely present to masquerade as a legitimate package.",
