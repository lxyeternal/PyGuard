      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines and immediately executes a function (EeTHdaPaEnHQyNRTnvIJDSmzahzxvKJr) that downloads a binary file named 'node' from an external URL (https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node) and saves it to /tmp/node. It then makes the file executable and runs it. This behavior is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source. The code also attempts to write to /tmp/config.json, though the content is missing. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, as well as the execution of a remote binary, are strong indicators of malicious intent. This could lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
