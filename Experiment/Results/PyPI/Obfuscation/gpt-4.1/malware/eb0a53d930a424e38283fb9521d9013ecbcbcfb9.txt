      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors, including: 1. Data Exfiltration: It collects sensitive user information such as browser cookies, saved passwords, local storage data, and possibly other credentials from various browsers and applications. 2. Token Stealing: It scans log files and memory for tokens (e.g., Discord tokens, API keys) and uploads them to remote servers. 3. Password and Credential Theft: It extracts stored passwords from browser databases and decrypts them using Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI). 4. Credential and File Uploading: It uploads stolen data and files to remote servers or transfer.sh, facilitating unauthorized data theft. 5. Remote Command Execution and Process Termination: It kills specific processes (e.g., browsers, wallets, Steam) to interfere with user activity or prevent detection. 6. Discord Integration for Data Sharing: It sends collected information to a Discord webhook, likely for the attacker to receive stolen data. 7. Persistence and Data Collection: It searches common directories for sensitive files, collects browser and application data, and may attempt to gather 2FA codes or other secrets. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily steal user credentials, tokens, and sensitive files, then exfiltrate them to an attacker-controlled server, which classifies it as malicious malware (e.g., info stealer, RAT, or spyware).",
