Additionally, the use of an empty 'exec()' statement suggests obfuscation or incomplete code, possibly intended to execute further malicious payloads. The overall structure and the presence of the webhook indicate malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or remote command execution.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code executes a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, imports modules and executes further code via `exec`. The decoded payload appears to be obfuscated and likely contains malicious behavior such as downloading or executing remote payloads, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The use of `exec` with decoded data is a common tactic in malicious scripts to hide their true intent and evade detection. Overall, this code is malicious, designed to run hidden, potentially harmful operations on the host system.",
