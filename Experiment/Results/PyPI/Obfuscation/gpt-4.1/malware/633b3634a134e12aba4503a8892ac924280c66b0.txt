It uses multiple layers of encoding, compression, and encryption (including base64, zlib, marshal, and Fernet encryption) to conceal malicious instructions. The final step involves executing dynamically decoded and decrypted code via `exec()`, which can run arbitrary malicious commands, such as downloading, installing malware, or establishing unauthorized remote access. This behavior indicates an intent to hide malicious activities and execute code without detection, confirming the code is malicious.",
