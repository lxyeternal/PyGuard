It installs a Chrome extension that injects obfuscated JavaScript designed to manipulate clipboard content, potentially to steal sensitive information like cryptocurrency addresses. Additionally, it searches for shortcut files (.lnk) across common user directories and modifies their target shortcuts to load a malicious extension into browsers like Chrome, Edge, or Brave. These behaviors aim to surreptitiously inject malicious scripts into the user's environment, facilitate data theft, and persist by hijacking browser shortcuts, all of which are characteristic of malware.",
