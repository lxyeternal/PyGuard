Additionally, it downloads and executes an external executable ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') from a suspicious URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') on Windows systems. This behavior indicates an attempt to perform unauthorized data exfiltration and execute potentially harmful code, which are characteristic of malicious activity.",
