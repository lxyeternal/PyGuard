      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious activities, including data exfiltration and potential denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. It fetches a remote URL, likely containing malicious payloads or commands, and attempts to extract Discord tokens from local storage files, which can be used for account hijacking or unauthorized access. Additionally, it includes functions that perform network requests to Discord's API with user tokens, possibly to verify or misuse these tokens. There are also functions that simulate or prepare for DDoS attacks, and some code snippets suggest user deception or social engineering (e.g., asking for passwords or IP addresses). Overall, the code's behavior aligns with typical malware or hacking tools aimed at stealing credentials, hijacking accounts, or disrupting services, confirming its malicious intent.",
