      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function that executes a crafted shell command via subprocess.run with shell=True, which constructs and sends a POST request to an external IP address (http://43.139.166.32). The command includes multiple shell command substitutions that gather sensitive system information such as hostname, user identity, current directory, contents of /etc/passwd, and bash history, and embeds this data into the HTTP request headers. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of sensitive system information to an external server, which is characteristic of malicious activity. Additionally, the code's obfuscated function names and the use of shell commands to collect system data further suggest malicious intent.",
