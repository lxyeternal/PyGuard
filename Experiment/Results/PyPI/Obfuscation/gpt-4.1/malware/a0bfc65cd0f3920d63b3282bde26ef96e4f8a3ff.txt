      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It disguises itself as a Python package setup script but contains obfuscated and hidden behavior. The most critical part is the use of base64-encoded data, which, when decoded and executed, performs the following actions:\n\n1. It checks for the existence of a file named 'hifromDreamyOak' and exits if it exists, likely as a kill-switch or to avoid re-infection.\n2. It downloads a Windows executable ('Windows.exe') from a Discord CDN URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/accounts/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe).\n3. It saves the downloaded file to a temporary location.\n4. It executes the downloaded file using subprocess.\n\nThis behavior is typical of a dropper or loader malware, which downloads and executes additional malicious payloads from the internet. The use of Discord CDN is a common tactic to evade detection and abuse legitimate infrastructure. The code is highly dangerous as it can compromise the system by running arbitrary code from a remote source, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code downloads an executable file ('Windows.exe') from a remote server (hosted on Discord's CDN) and saves it to a temporary file on the local system. It then executes this downloaded file using subprocess.call. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, as it allows the remote execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The downloaded executable could perform any number of malicious actions, such as stealing data, installing backdoors, or further compromising the system. Downloading and executing code from an untrusted remote source is a classic technique used in malware delivery and is considered highly dangerous.",
