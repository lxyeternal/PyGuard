Additionally, it downloads and executes a potentially malicious script from a remote URL, which could lead to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. The use of shell=True in subprocess.Popen further increases the risk of command injection or execution of arbitrary code. Overall, these behaviors indicate malicious intent aimed at compromising the host system and exfiltrating data.",
