It collects sensitive information from the host system, including the current call stack, environment variable names, system information (os.uname()), and the public IP address (via https://ipinfo.io/ip). It then encodes this data as JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a remote server (the URL is base64-encoded and decodes to a Slack webhook endpoint). The code attempts to evade detection by not running on specific hostnames or filenames. This behavior constitutes data exfiltration and is a clear indicator of malicious intent, as it leaks potentially sensitive information to an external party without user consent.",
