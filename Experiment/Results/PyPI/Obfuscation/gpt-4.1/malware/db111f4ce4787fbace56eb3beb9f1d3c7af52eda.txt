      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and non-standard argument names) is intended to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy (a fake setup() call) to make the file look like a legitimate Python package setup script. This code, if run on a Windows system, will compromise the machine by downloading and executing potentially harmful software.",
