      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (kBxWDQaqVHecJsWoPfjbXnfFYZelVbmI) that, during installation on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute a block of encrypted Python code via exec(). The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, but this pattern is a classic method for hiding and executing malicious code (such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or system compromise) during package installation. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and execution during the install process are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This code could potentially harm the system by running arbitrary, hidden code with the user's privileges.",
