Additionally, it makes an HTTP request to an external server ('http://homografo.junquera.xyz:9999') with encoded parameters that include a flag indicating whether the file writing succeeded. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or remote command/control communication, potentially used for malicious purposes such as compromising the system, spying, or controlling the infected host. The obfuscated variable names and the attempt to contact an external server further support the malicious intent.",
