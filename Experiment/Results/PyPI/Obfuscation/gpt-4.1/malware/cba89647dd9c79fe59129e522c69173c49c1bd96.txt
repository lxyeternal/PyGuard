      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated or intentionally misleading setup script. It imports standard packaging modules but assigns nonsensical or random variable names, and includes suspiciously encoded or obfuscated strings such as 'XAfwAWwOhAshypKkAcogKSHTCCYmgPgI=' which is assigned the value 'text/markdown'. Additionally, the 'keywords' parameter is set to 'maths', and the 'install_requires' (likely intended as 'install_requires') is assigned a list containing 'pynput'. While these elements alone are not inherently malicious, the obfuscation, random variable names, and unusual parameter assignments suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent or payloads. This code could be used to disguise malicious package setup or to embed malicious dependencies or scripts, especially if further obfuscated code exists elsewhere. Therefore, it is flagged as malicious due to its suspicious obfuscation and potential for hidden malicious behavior.",

This behavior suggests an attempt to run potentially malicious or unauthorized code without user consent or awareness. The script 'secretary.py' could contain malicious payloads, backdoors, or other harmful operations. Additionally, the code does not perform any validation or checks on the external script, increasing the risk of executing malicious content. Overall, this behavior indicates malicious intent or at least suspicious activity that could compromise system security.",

It uses the 'pynput' library to monitor keyboard input, logs the keystrokes, and periodically emails the data to a specified email account. This behavior is characteristic of malicious keylogging malware designed to steal sensitive user information such as passwords, personal data, or confidential communications without user consent.",
