      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during installation, asynchronously sends the host's hostname and IP address to a specified Discord webhook URL. This behavior is suspicious because it collects system information without user consent and transmits it to an external server, which is characteristic of data exfiltration or reconnaissance activities. The use of asynchronous code within a setup script and the obfuscated class name further suggest malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to secretly gather and send system information, indicating malicious behavior.",
