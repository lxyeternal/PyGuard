      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('supra.exe') from a suspicious external URL and saves it to the user's startup folder, specifically targeting the Windows startup programs directory. It then attempts to execute this file immediately. This behavior indicates an attempt to persist malicious code on the victim's system, likely for purposes such as remote control, data theft, or further malware deployment. The use of obfuscated or non-descriptive filenames and the placement in the startup folder are common tactics used by malware to maintain persistence and evade detection.",
