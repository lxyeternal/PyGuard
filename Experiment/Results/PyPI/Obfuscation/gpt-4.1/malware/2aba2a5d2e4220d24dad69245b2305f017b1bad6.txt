Specifically, the payloads include code that appears to set up network communication, potentially for command-and-control or data exfiltration, and may include code to download or execute additional malicious scripts. The presence of base64 decoding and dynamic execution (via exec) strongly indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code also references network-related functions, such as making HTTP requests, which could be used to send stolen data or receive commands. Overall, the code is designed to conceal malicious behavior, likely to compromise the system, exfiltrate data, or establish remote control, making it malicious.",
