      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a command that fetches and runs a script from an external URL (ghttp://gsocket.io/x) via a curl command, which is a common technique for downloading and executing malicious payloads. Additionally, it restricts execution to Linux systems only, possibly to avoid detection or analysis on other platforms. The obfuscated function and class names, along with the use of system calls to download and run external code, strongly suggest malicious intent, such as installing backdoors, remote access tools, or other malware. The overall behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and execute potentially harmful code from an external source.",
