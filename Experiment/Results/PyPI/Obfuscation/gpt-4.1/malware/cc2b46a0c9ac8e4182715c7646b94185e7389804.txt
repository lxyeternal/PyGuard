      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and convoluted logic that appears designed to hide malicious intent. It dynamically imports modules, manipulates data in a way that suggests code injection or remote code execution, and references external URLs (including a GitHub repository and a Discord link) that could be used for command and control or data exfiltration. The presence of complex, nonsensical code structures, such as lambda functions with obfuscated strings, dynamic attribute access, and conditional logic that triggers functions with suspicious payloads, strongly indicates malicious behavior. Overall, this code is likely intended to perform malicious activities such as remote command execution, data theft, or establishing unauthorized connections, while attempting to evade detection through obfuscation.",
