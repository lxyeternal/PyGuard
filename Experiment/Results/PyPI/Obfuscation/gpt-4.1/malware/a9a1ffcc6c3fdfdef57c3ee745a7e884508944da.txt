It uses 'Invoke-WebRequest' to fetch the file and 'Invoke-Expression' to execute it, which can lead to remote code execution and compromise of the host system. Additionally, the code tries to install the 'subprocess' module via pip if it's not available, which is unnecessary since 'subprocess' is a standard library in Python 3. The overall behavior indicates an attempt to silently download and run malicious payloads, making this code malicious.",
