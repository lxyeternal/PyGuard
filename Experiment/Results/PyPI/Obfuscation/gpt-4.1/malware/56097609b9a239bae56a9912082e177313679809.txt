Specifically, it decrypts and executes a Fernet-encrypted payload, which could be used to run arbitrary malicious code, establish remote access, or perform other harmful actions. The obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and conditional execution on Windows are typical indicators of malicious intent designed to evade detection and compromise the host system.",
