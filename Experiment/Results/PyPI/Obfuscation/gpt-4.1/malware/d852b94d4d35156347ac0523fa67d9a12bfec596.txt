      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that exfiltrates environment variables to an external server. Specifically, during the installation process, the custom 'AfterInstall' class executes the 'iirisfunc()' function, which encodes all current environment variables into a base64 string and sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external URL ('https://eow8fqyd1emg87l.m.pipedream.net/'). This behavior can be used to harvest sensitive information such as environment variables, system details, or credentials, and transmit them to an attacker-controlled server without user consent. The code also references a package description indicating it is for a 'Dependency Confusion attack,' which suggests malicious intent to deceive or compromise systems through package misdirection. Overall, this code is designed to surreptitiously collect and exfiltrate data, constituting malicious behavior.",
