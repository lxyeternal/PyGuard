      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior designed to establish persistence and potentially facilitate remote control or data exfiltration. Specifically, it clones a GitHub repository into the Windows startup folder, ensuring the cloned content executes automatically on system startup. Additionally, it moves a script named 'test.py' into this startup directory, which could be used to execute malicious payloads without user consent. These actions are typical of malware aiming to maintain persistence, execute malicious code at startup, and potentially compromise the infected system.",
