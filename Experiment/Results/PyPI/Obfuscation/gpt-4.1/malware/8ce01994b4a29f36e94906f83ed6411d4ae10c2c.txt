      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated payload that decodes and executes base64-encoded Python code, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activities. The decoded code imports socket, threading, base64, struct, and time modules, and appears to establish network connections, potentially for command and control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, or remote code execution. The use of 'exec' on decoded data and the obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, such as creating a backdoor, malware, or spyware.",
