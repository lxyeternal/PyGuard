Additionally, on Windows systems, it downloads and executes an external executable ('ini_file_pyp_41.exe') from a suspicious URL ('https://python-release.com/python-install.scr') without user consent. This behavior indicates an attempt to exfiltrate data and execute potentially harmful code, characteristic of malware or a backdoor.",
