      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload, when decoded, runs a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic remote code execution and malware delivery technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags and encoded PowerShell commands is a common method to evade detection. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script. The actual purpose is to download and execute potentially harmful software, which could be a trojan, backdoor, or other type of malware, putting the system and user data at risk.",
