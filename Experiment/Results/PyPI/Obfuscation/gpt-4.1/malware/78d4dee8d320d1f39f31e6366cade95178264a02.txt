      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (EysNsyJHvMvzZvrmDjiLJTdTnKkBdMrs) that, during installation on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and the decryption key is hardcoded. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, data stealers, or remote access trojans. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis. The code could potentially download and execute further malicious code, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system in other ways.",
