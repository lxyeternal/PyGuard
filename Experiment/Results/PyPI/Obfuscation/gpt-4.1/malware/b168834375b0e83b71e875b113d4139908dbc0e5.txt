Additionally, it imports all functions and variables from the 'colorama' library, a legitimate library used for colored terminal text. The critical malicious activity is the invocation of 'AkaZRlGQjVIqeitKqceyYidozfYNwsXp()', a function with an obfuscated name that appears to be randomly generated. This function call suggests an attempt to execute hidden or malicious code, possibly to perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or establishing persistence. The obfuscation and the lack of context strongly indicate malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious data exfiltration and wallet theft. It collects sensitive files related to a cryptocurrency wallet (exodus), including configuration, wallet info, seed, passphrase, and two-factor secrets, and compresses them into a ZIP archive. It then retrieves the victim's IP address and country code, encodes the country code into a flag emoji, and sends the ZIP file along with system information to a Telegram bot via its API. The code also constructs a message containing the IP and country code, which it sends as a message to the Telegram chat. This behavior indicates an intent to steal wallet data and personal information, and exfiltrate it covertly, which is characteristic of malicious malware such as info-stealers or trojans.",
