It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server controlled by an attacker. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is malicious. The code does not perform any legitimate setup-related functions with this data, suggesting its primary purpose is to gather and transmit potentially sensitive information surreptitiously.",
