      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity. It attempts to gather sensitive system information such as AWS IAM credentials, hostname, current working directory, username, IP address, and SSH configurations. It then encodes and obfuscates this data, writes it to a temporary file, and exfiltrates it via HTTP POST requests to external servers (graphs.pygrata.com). Additionally, it performs DNS queries with encoded data, likely for covert communication or command-and-control purposes. The presence of these behaviors—data collection, obfuscation, and exfiltration—strongly suggests malicious intent, such as espionage, data theft, or establishing a backdoor.",
