      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes a remote script from an external URL, which is a common tactic used in malicious activities. It retrieves a shell script from 'https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh', saves it locally, makes it executable, and then runs it with specific arguments. This behavior allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host machine, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions. The script's purpose appears to be to install or run potentially harmful operations without user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
