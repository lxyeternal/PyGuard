This behavior suggests data exfiltration or tracking of the target machine's name, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks related to the package itself, indicating that its primary purpose is likely to secretly send information to an attacker-controlled server, making it malicious.",
