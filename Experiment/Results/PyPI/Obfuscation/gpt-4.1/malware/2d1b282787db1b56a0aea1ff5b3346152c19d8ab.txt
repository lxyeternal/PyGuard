      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It is a trojanized Python package that, when installed or imported (except during 'sdist' source distribution creation), executes a large, obfuscated, and base64-encoded payload. The payload is different for Windows and non-Windows systems, but both are designed to perform harmful actions. \n\n**Windows branch:**\n- The code writes a binary file (with a random name) to the system's temporary directory. The binary content is a large, obfuscated, base64-encoded blob, which is then written to disk and likely executed. The binary appears to be a Windows executable (EXE) and contains a message indicating it cannot be run in DOS mode, which is typical of Windows PE files. This is a classic technique for dropping and running malware on a victim's machine.\n\n**Non-Windows branch:**\n- The code decodes and executes a large base64-encoded Python script. This script imports a wide range of modules (including os, io, base64, requests, PIL, etc.), and contains functions for data exfiltration, file system access, screenshot capture, browser data theft, and communication with remote servers. It attempts to steal browser cookies, credentials, and other sensitive information, and uploads them to remote servers (including Telegram and other endpoints). It also attempts to persist on the system and evade detection.\n\n**General behavior:**\n- The code is heavily obfuscated, uses base64 encoding, and attempts to evade detection by only running the payload when not building a source distribution.\n- It targets both Windows and Linux/Mac systems, adapting its payload accordingly.\n- It attempts to steal sensitive data (browser data, credentials, screenshots, etc.) and exfiltrate it to remote servers.\n- It may download and execute additional payloads, and attempts to persist on the victim's system.\n\n**Potential harm:**\n- Theft of sensitive information (passwords, cookies, files, screenshots, etc.)\n- Remote code execution and system compromise\n- Installation of further malware or ransomware\n- Use of the victim's system as part of a botnet or for further attacks\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a highly dangerous, multi-platform information stealer and remote access trojan (RAT) embedded in a Python package. It should be considered extremely malicious and should not be run under any circumstances.",
