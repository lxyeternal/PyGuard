      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encrypted payloads that are decoded and executed dynamically using eval and exec functions. It employs multiple layers of encoding (base64, zlib compression, character code transformations) to hide its true intent. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with the use of eval on decoded data, indicates an attempt to conceal malicious actions such as downloading, executing, or manipulating malicious code at runtime. Additionally, the code references external URLs and includes complex, unreadable strings that suggest it is designed to evade detection and perform harmful operations, such as installing malware, stealing data, or establishing unauthorized access.",
