However, it contains a suspicious and non-standard keyword argument 'dVYRvPLQMYZdIQlejBNEVsWEGnSmVurk' with a value of 'x0oe1j1gmm691vfx' passed to the setup() function. This is not a recognized argument for setuptools and may be used to trigger malicious behavior in a modified or trojanized version of setuptools, or to exfiltrate data or signal to a C2 server in a compromised environment. The use of a random, obfuscated keyword is a common tactic in malicious packages to evade detection and may be used to execute arbitrary code or perform other harmful actions during package installation. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and is a variant of the 'W4SP Stealer' malware. Its primary purpose is to steal sensitive user data from the infected system and exfiltrate it to an external server via a Discord webhook. The malicious behaviors include:\n\n1. **Credential and Token Theft**: The code searches for and extracts Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other authentication data from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) and Discord installations. It uses Windows cryptographic APIs to decrypt stored credentials.\n\n2. **File and Wallet Stealing**: It searches for files with keywords related to accounts, passwords, wallets, and cryptocurrency, and uploads them to an external file hosting service (gofile.io), then sends the download links to the attacker's webhook.\n\n3. **Exfiltration**: All stolen data, including credentials, cookies, tokens, and files, are sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/1038260153943871570/IR9X_stIH1BofuEaty3yogzkViJfw1bI_lYdrukq4qox1r9xcuK8JTqJWpwYnsE-F3Tj) controlled by the attacker.\n\n4. **Persistence and Evasion**: The code uses threading to speed up data collection and to evade detection. It also attempts to kill certain processes (e.g., browsers, wallets) to access locked files.\n\n5. **Geolocation and System Info**: It collects the victim's public IP, geolocation, and system username to include in the exfiltrated data.\n\n6. **Self-Installation of Dependencies**: The code attempts to install missing Python packages (requests, pycryptodome) automatically, increasing its chance of successful execution.\n\n7. **Obfuscation**: The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to hinder analysis and detection.\n\n**Potential Harm**: This malware can lead to severe privacy breaches, account takeovers (Discord, social media, banking, crypto wallets), financial loss, and further compromise of the victim's digital identity. It is designed to operate stealthily and efficiently, targeting a wide range of sensitive data.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a credential stealer and infostealer malware, and running it will result in the theft of a wide range of sensitive information from the victim's computer.",
