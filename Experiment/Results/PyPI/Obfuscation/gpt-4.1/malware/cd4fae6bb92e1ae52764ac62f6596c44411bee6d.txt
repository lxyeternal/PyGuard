      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server (IP 3.228.3.164 on port 80). It reads process information from /proc, writes it to a file, and then connects to the attacker's server, redirecting the shell's input/output streams to this connection. This allows an attacker to remotely execute commands on the compromised machine, effectively taking control of the system. The code is embedded within setup scripts, which may be used to disguise malicious intent under the guise of a legitimate package installation. Overall, this behavior constitutes a clear backdoor or remote access trojan, making the code malicious.",
