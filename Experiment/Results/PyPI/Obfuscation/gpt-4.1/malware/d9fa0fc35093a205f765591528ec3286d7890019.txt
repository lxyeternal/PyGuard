      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the username, hostname, and public IP address by making an HTTP GET request to an external service ('https://enabledns.com/ip'). It then sends this data, along with additional metadata (e.g., package name, language version, timestamp), to an external server ('http://123.206.22.33:5000/p/') via an HTTP POST request. This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code also creates a hidden file in the temporary directory, likely as a marker to prevent repeated execution, which is a common tactic in malware to maintain persistence or avoid detection. Overall, these actions suggest the code is designed to secretly gather and transmit system information, making it malicious.",
