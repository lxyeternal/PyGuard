      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that hooks into the installation process of a Python package. During installation, it imports modules such as aiohttp, socket, requests, and discord, then retrieves the hostname and IP address of the machine. It constructs a Discord webhook and sends messages containing the hostname, IP address, and platform information. This behavior indicates that the script is exfiltrating sensitive system information to an external Discord webhook, which is a common tactic used in malicious activities such as data theft, remote monitoring, or command-and-control communication. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest malicious intent, aiming to hide its true purpose.",
