      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden and suspicious behavior that indicates malicious intent. Specifically, it registers a function to execute upon program exit, which writes a proof message to a file ('pocbykotko.txt') and then collects sensitive system information such as the public IP address, hostname, and script path. It encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain ('kotko.org') with a custom query parameter. This behavior suggests data exfiltration of system information without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity aimed at spying or unauthorized data collection.",
