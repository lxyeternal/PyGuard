It also performs similar operations with another URL (http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg'), saving it as 'local_b.txt' and executing it as a batch file ('loc.bat').

The class `cQTuyFaSxjlzEqARIUFPJVWvTgFlxvqR` appears to be a lookup or configuration object that retrieves data from its internal dictionary or from its `__dict__`.

Such code could be used to store, retrieve, and conceal malicious payloads, configuration, or command-and-control data, especially since it does not perform any obvious legitimate function.
