      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits typical characteristics of obfuscated malware. It begins by installing numerous packages, including system and cryptography libraries, which suggests an intent to perform complex operations or evade detection. The core of the code is an 'exec' statement that executes a payload decompressed from gzip-compressed binary data using 'marshal.loads'. This pattern indicates code obfuscation aimed at hiding malicious intent. Such techniques are commonly used to deliver payloads that can perform unauthorized actions like data theft, remote command execution, or establishing persistence. The presence of cryptography libraries (pycryptodome, win32crypt), system interaction modules (winreg, win32gui, psutil), and clipboard access (pyperclip) further supports the likelihood of malicious activities such as credential harvesting, system manipulation, or covert data exfiltration. Overall, this code is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
