      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, performs the following actions: (1) It collects the victim's computer name from the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' and sends it to a remote server (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a clear exfiltration of system information. (2) If the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', then executes it using os.system. This behavior can result in the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to further compromise, such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or taking control of the system. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, as well as the silent exception handling, further indicate an attempt to evade detection. This code is highly dangerous and should be considered malware.",
