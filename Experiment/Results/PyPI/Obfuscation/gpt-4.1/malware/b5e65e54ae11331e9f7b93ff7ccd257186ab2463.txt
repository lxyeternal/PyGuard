      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function that, when executed, performs the following malicious actions: it opens a URL connection to a suspicious domain, establishes a TCP connection to an external IP address on port 8080, and then redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. Finally, it spawns an interactive shell ('/bin/sh') connected to this socket. This effectively creates a backdoor, allowing an attacker to remotely access and control the compromised system. The code is designed to silently establish remote access, which is characteristic of malicious remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors.",
