      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that overrides the installation process to execute a decryption and remote code execution step during installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it decrypts a payload using Fernet symmetric encryption and executes it via `exec()`. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary malicious code during package installation, which is a common tactic for malware or backdoor deployment. The use of obfuscated variable names and the inclusion of encrypted payloads further suggest malicious intent, as legitimate code typically avoids such obfuscation and hidden behaviors.",
