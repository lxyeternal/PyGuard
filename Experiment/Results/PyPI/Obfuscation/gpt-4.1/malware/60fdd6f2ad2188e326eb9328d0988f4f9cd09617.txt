      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that, upon execution on Windows systems, decrypts and executes malicious code fetched from an embedded Fernet-encrypted payload. This behavior allows remote code execution, potentially enabling an attacker to run arbitrary commands, steal data, or compromise the system. The obfuscated variable names and the use of cryptographic decryption further suggest an intent to conceal malicious activity. Overall, this code exhibits typical traits of malicious malware designed to establish unauthorized access or control over the host system.",
