      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, misleading variable names, and hidden execution) is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup. This code can compromise the system by downloading and executing arbitrary code from the internet, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware infection.",
