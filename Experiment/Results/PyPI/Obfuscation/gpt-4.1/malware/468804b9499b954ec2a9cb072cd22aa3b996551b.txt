      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded PowerShell, as well as the attempt to evade detection by checking for a marker file ('tahg'), are clear indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
