      "malicious_behavior": "This code downloads an executable file ('kekwltd.exe') from a remote server ('https://kekwltd.ru/kekwltd.exe') and saves it to a directory within the user's APPDATA\\Microsoft folder. It then executes the downloaded file using the Windows 'start' command. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper, which is a common component in malware delivery chains. The code attempts to hide the downloaded file in a system-related directory, which is a common tactic to evade detection. Downloading and executing remote binaries without user consent is highly malicious, as it can lead to the installation of further malware, data theft, system compromise, or other harmful actions.",
