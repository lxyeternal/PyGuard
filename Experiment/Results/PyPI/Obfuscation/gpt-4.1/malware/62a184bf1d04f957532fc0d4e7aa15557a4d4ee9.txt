      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `notmalfunc()` that decodes a base64-encoded string into Python code and executes it via `os.system()`. The decoded code appears to perform network requests to a remote URL (`https://github.com/Excel75/neofetchev/blob/main/pyw`) and potentially executes further commands or payloads. This behavior suggests an attempt to run arbitrary or malicious code fetched from an external source, which could lead to remote command execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and the execution of decoded code are common techniques in malicious scripts to evade detection and execute harmful payloads.",
