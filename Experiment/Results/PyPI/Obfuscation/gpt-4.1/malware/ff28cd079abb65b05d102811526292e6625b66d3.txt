      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, which is decrypted at install time and executed via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions, while evading static analysis. The use of obfuscated variable names and encrypted payloads is a strong indicator of intent to conceal malicious activity. The code will execute automatically when the package is installed, potentially compromising the system.",
