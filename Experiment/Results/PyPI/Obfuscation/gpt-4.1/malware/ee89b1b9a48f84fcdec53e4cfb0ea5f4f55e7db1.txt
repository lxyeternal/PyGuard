      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function that establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server at IP 49.233.121.53 on port 54. It does so by decoding base64-encoded IP and port, creating a socket, connecting to the remote host, redirecting standard input/output/error to the socket, and then invoking an interactive shell. This behavior allows an attacker to gain remote control over the compromised system, which is a classic malicious activity. Additionally, the code is embedded within a setup script, which may be used to disguise or deploy the malicious payload during installation.",
