      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command (when decoded) downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader or dropper, which is used to fetch and execute additional malware on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, misleading variable names, and hidden window execution) further indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup.",
