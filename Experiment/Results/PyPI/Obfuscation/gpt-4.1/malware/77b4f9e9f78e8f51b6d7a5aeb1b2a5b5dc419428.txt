      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, which is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malicious code, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions, while evading static analysis. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and execution during the installation process are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code could potentially download and execute further malware, steal sensitive information, or compromise the system in other ways.",
