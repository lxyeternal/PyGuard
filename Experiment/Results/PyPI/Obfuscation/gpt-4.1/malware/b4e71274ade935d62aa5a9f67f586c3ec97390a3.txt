      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and employs multiple layers of decoding, eval, and dynamic code execution. It decodes base64-encoded strings, interprets them as code, and executes them at runtime. The use of eval with decoded strings, combined with the complex, unreadable structure, strongly suggests an attempt to hide malicious payloads such as malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. The code likely downloads or executes malicious scripts, potentially compromising the system or stealing data. Overall, this is malicious code designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions.",
