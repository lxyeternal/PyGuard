      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbuq0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing malware on a victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' ensures the command runs without a visible window, making it stealthy. The check for the existence of the 'tahg' file is likely used to prevent repeated execution. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup. This behavior can result in remote code execution, compromise of the system, and further malicious activity.",
