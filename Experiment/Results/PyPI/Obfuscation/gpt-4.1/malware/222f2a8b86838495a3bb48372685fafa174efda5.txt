      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated payload that decodes and executes hidden Python code embedded as a base64-encoded string. This technique is commonly used to conceal malicious activities such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or installing backdoors. The decoded code appears to import modules, connect to a remote server, and potentially execute arbitrary commands, which indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the use of 'exec' on decoded data is a significant red flag, as it allows execution of arbitrary, potentially harmful code without transparency or oversight.",
