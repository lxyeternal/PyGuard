      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that, during installation on macOS systems, decodes base64-encoded commands to execute system commands via subprocess. It appears to check for specific identifiers and, upon matching, reads a PDF file, creates directories, writes a segment of the file to disk, sets permissions, and then executes the file. This behavior suggests the code is designed to download, extract, and execute potentially malicious payloads covertly during installation, which is a common tactic in malware distribution. The obfuscation through base64 encoding and the dynamic execution of external files indicate malicious intent to compromise the system.",
