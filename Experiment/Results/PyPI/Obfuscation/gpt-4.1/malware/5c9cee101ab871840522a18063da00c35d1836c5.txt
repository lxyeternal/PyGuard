      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic technique for downloading and executing malware on a victim's machine. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded command, as well as the obfuscation and silent error handling, are all indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code can result in remote code execution, compromise of the system, and further malicious activity.",
