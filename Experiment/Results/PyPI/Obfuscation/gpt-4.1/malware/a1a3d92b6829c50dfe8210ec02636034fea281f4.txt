It also downloads another file (http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg), saves it as 'local_b.txt', and executes it as a batch file ('loc.bat'). These actions are characteristic of malicious behavior such as downloading and executing remote payloads, potentially leading to remote code execution, malware installation, or other harmful activities. The code also attempts to install the 'requests' library if not present, which is common in malicious scripts to ensure they can fetch remote content. Overall, the code exhibits typical malicious patterns of remote command and control, payload delivery, and execution, indicating it is malicious.",

However, the obfuscation, unusual import patterns, and the presence of nonsensical or placeholder exception names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent or to evade detection. Such obfuscation is common in malicious code designed to perform covert operations, such as data exfiltration, command and control communication, or other malicious activities, under the guise of a legitimate library.
