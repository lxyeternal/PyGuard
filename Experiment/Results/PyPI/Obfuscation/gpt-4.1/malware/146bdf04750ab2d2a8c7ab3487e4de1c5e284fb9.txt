      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and base64-encoded payloads that, when decoded and executed, perform malicious activities. Specifically, it appears to be a heavily obfuscated script designed to execute remote code, potentially download and run malicious payloads, or establish backdoors. The presence of encoded strings, dynamic execution via `exec()`, and the inclusion of suspicious URL references (e.g., 'http://ip-api.com/line/?fields=') strongly suggest it is intended for malicious purposes such as remote command execution, data exfiltration, or establishing persistence on the compromised system. The code's structure and obfuscation techniques are typical of malware or malicious scripts aiming to evade detection and analysis.",
