      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects all environment variables from the system (using os.environ.items()) and sends them via an HTTP POST request to an external server (https://a5gpivpedls2wjfxl0bm6dmwenke84wt.oastify.com) using the requests library. Exfiltrating environment variables is a common technique for stealing sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and other secrets that may be present in the environment. This behavior is hidden within the installation process of a Python package, making it a supply chain attack vector. The code attempts to print a success or failure message based on the HTTP response, but its primary purpose is data theft.",
