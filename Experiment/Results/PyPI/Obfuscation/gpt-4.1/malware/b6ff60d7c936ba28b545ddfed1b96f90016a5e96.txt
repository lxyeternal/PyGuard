      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains dynamically generated and obfuscated eval calls that decode and execute hidden code. It uses complex, meaningless variable names and large blocks of seemingly random strings, which are typical obfuscation techniques. The presence of functions that manipulate strings with character shifts and conditional execution based on Python version indicates an attempt to hide malicious payloads. The code likely decodes and runs malicious scripts or commands at runtime, making it a clear case of malicious behavior designed to evade detection and execute harmful actions.",
