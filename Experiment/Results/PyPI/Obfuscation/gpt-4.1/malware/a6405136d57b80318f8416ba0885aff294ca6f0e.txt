      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload, when decoded, runs a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic example of a downloader or dropper, which is used to fetch and execute additional malware on the victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' and 'subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW' ensures the process is hidden from the user, making the attack stealthy. The code is wrapped in try/except blocks to suppress errors and avoid detection. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the file look like a legitimate Python package setup script. This code can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or further compromise of the system.",
