      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic example of a downloader or dropper, which is used to fetch and execute additional malware on the victim's machine. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags and encoded PowerShell is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or further compromise of the system.",
