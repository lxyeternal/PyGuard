      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that perform unauthorized data exfiltration by sending system and user information to an external server (http://3.221.152.203:8000/acl/package/...). It gathers sensitive environment details such as the current working directory, username, and home directory, then attempts to send this data via curl commands embedded in the code. Additionally, the code's obfuscated function and variable names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The use of network requests to an external IP address and the collection of system information without user consent are typical malicious behaviors aimed at spying, data theft, or remote control.",
