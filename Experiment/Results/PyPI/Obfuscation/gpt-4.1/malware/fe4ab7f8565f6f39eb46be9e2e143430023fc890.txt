      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, as indicated by the presence of a URL-like string within the encoded command. Additionally, the code creates a directory named 'tahg' and then proceeds to run the obfuscated PowerShell command without any user interaction or validation, which is suspicious. The use of 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' and hidden window style further suggests an intent to operate covertly. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts designed to download, execute, or persist malicious payloads on a victim's system.",
