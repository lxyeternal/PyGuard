      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, ensuring it is not visible to the user. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download and execute additional payloads on the victim's machine, potentially leading to further compromise, data theft, or system damage. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden execution, and misleading setup metadata) further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
