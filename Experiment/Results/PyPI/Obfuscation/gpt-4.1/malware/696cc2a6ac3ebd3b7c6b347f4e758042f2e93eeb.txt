      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `notmalfunc()` that decodes a base64-encoded string into Python code and executes it via `os.system()`. The decoded code appears to perform network requests to a remote URL (`https://github.com/Excel75/neofetchev/blob/main/pyw`) and potentially download and execute further malicious payloads. The presence of obfuscated code, combined with the behavior of executing decoded code and making network requests, strongly suggests malicious intent. Additionally, the code's structure, including the obfuscation and delayed print statements, indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity and deceive analysis. Overall, this code is designed to download and execute malicious payloads, making it malicious.",
