      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The payload is decrypted at install time using a hardcoded Fernet key and then executed via the exec() function. This technique is commonly used to hide the true intent of the code and evade static analysis. The decrypted payload could perform any arbitrary action, such as downloading and executing further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and execution during the installation process are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
