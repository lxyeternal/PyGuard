      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic remote code execution and malware delivery technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common method to evade detection and run commands without user visibility. The code also tries to hide its activity by running only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, and it suppresses all exceptions. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code can compromise the system by downloading and running arbitrary executables, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware infection.",
