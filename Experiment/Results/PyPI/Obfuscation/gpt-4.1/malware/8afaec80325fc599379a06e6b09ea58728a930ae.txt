      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing malware on a victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common method to evade detection and run commands without user visibility. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is benign and likely present to disguise the malicious intent. The code is designed to run on Windows systems and will attempt to infect the machine by downloading and executing a potentially harmful executable.",
