      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The code checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command in hidden mode (using -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW) to download and execute a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then executes it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to fetch and run additional malware on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated and encoded PowerShell commands, as well as the attempt to hide the process window, are clear indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is likely a decoy to make the script appear as a legitimate Python package setup script.",
