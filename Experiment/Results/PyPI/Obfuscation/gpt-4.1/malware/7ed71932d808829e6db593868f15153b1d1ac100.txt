It also sends an HTTP request to a suspicious URL ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw') with the machine's hostname, which could be used for tracking or command-and-control purposes. The code is designed to run during the installation process of a package, making it likely to be part of a supply chain attack or malware distribution scheme.",
