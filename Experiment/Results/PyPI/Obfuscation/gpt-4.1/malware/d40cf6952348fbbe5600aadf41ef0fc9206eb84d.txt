      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated, dynamically executed payloads that decode and run hidden code via zlib decompression and eval/exec functions. It employs complex, nested lambda functions with obfuscated strings, likely to conceal malicious activities such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or payload delivery. The presence of such obfuscation, combined with the use of eval, compile, and decompress functions, strongly indicates malicious intent aimed at evading detection and executing arbitrary code at runtime.",
