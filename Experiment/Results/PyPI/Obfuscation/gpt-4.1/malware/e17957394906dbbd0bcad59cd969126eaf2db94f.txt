      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, ensuring it is not visible to the user. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is a common first stage in malware infections. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden execution, and misleading setup metadata) further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code is designed to be executed as part of a Python package installation, making it especially dangerous as it could be distributed via a package repository and executed on unsuspecting users' systems.",
