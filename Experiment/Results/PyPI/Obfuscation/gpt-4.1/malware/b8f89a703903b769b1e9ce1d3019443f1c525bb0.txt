      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered (such as during package installation), collects sensitive information from the victim's system. Specifically, it gathers the current working directory, system information (via uname/systeminfo), network configuration (ifconfig/ipconfig), public IP address (via curl ifconfig.me), the current user (whoami), and the hostname. It then exfiltrates all this data by sending it to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL using a crafted curl command. This behavior constitutes a data exfiltration attack, leaking potentially sensitive information to an external attacker without the user's knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
