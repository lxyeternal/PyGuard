      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing malware on a victim's machine. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, hidden window, and encoded command is a common method to evade detection. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script. This code is designed to compromise the system by downloading and running potentially harmful executable code from the internet.",
