      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that, when run on Windows systems, decrypts and executes a payload embedded within the script. Specifically, it uses the Fernet encryption scheme to decrypt a payload and execute it dynamically via exec(). This behavior allows an attacker to run arbitrary malicious code on the host machine, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of encrypted payloads are common tactics in malicious scripts to evade detection.",
