      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and is a classic example of an information stealer, specifically targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, cryptocurrency wallets, and other sensitive user data. The code performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. **Credential and Token Theft**: It searches for and extracts Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data from various locations on the victim's computer, including Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, Yandex, and Discord installations.\n\n2. **Decryption of Stored Credentials**: The code uses Windows cryptographic APIs and the AES algorithm to decrypt browser-stored credentials, allowing it to access plaintext passwords and tokens.\n\n3. **File Exfiltration**: It searches the user's Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders for files with keywords like 'password', 'wallet', 'crypto', 'secret', etc., and uploads them to a remote server (gofile.io).\n\n4. **Data Exfiltration via Webhook**: Stolen data is sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1052549671110848542/IJbJYSGisCyG7LPj4Seg5CGxSiA_Fo3FtrSAtgUN8pT3utKu4q9suI3Dge1yl7aNWgs4), giving the attacker immediate access to the victim's sensitive information.\n\n5. **Persistence and Evasion**: The code attempts to install required dependencies at runtime, making it more likely to run successfully on the victim's machine. It also uses threading to speed up data collection and exfiltration.\n\n6. **Targeted Data**: The code specifically targets cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Exodus, Atomic Wallet), gaming accounts (Steam, Riot, NationsGlory), and messaging apps (Telegram), in addition to browser and Discord data.\n\n7. **Obfuscation**: The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to hinder analysis and detection.\n\n8. **Abuse of Setup Script**: The malicious code is embedded in what appears to be a Python package setup script, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks.\n\n**Potential Harm**: This malware can lead to severe privacy violations, financial loss (via stolen crypto wallets and accounts), account takeovers, and further compromise of the victim's digital life. It is designed to operate stealthily and exfiltrate as much valuable data as possible.\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a dangerous credential stealer and data exfiltration tool. It should be considered highly malicious and must not be executed under any circumstances.",
