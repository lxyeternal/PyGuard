      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic dropper behavior, where the script downloads and executes potentially harmful software without the user's consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, misleading variable names, and silent error handling) further indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup script to evade detection.",
