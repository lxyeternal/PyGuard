It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server ('https://eol6mx6at717hhs.m.pipedream.net/generaldelta'). This behavior is suspicious because it exfiltrates potentially sensitive user and system data without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as data theft or reconnaissance. The code does not perform any legitimate setup-related functions with this data, indicating malicious intent.",
