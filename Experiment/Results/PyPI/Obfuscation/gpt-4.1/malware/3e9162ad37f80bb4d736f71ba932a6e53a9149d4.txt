      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes a script from an external URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/93kcirG1) by saving it into a hidden directory within the user's AppData/Roaming folder. It then attempts to import this script as a module, or if that fails, executes it directly. This behavior indicates remote code execution, which is a common tactic used by malware to run arbitrary malicious code on the victim's machine. The use of threading to perform the download asynchronously further suggests an attempt to evade detection or delay analysis. Overall, this code is designed to fetch and run potentially harmful code from an external source, making it malicious.",
