      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes. It searches for environment files (*.env) across the system, reads their contents, and encodes them in base64, potentially exfiltrating sensitive environment variables. Additionally, it attempts to read the user's SSH private key ('id_rsa') and send it to a remote server via a curl command, which could lead to credential theft. The code also constructs URLs with parameters that include encoded data and makes HTTP requests to a remote server, indicating data exfiltration. The package metadata describes it as an exploit for Windows RPC vulnerabilities, further suggesting malicious intent. Overall, the code is crafted to gather sensitive information and transmit it to an attacker-controlled server, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
