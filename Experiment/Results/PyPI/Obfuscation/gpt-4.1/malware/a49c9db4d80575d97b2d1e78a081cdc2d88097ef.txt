      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded command, as well as the obfuscation and attempt to avoid detection (e.g., only running if a file 'tahg' does not exist), are all indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
