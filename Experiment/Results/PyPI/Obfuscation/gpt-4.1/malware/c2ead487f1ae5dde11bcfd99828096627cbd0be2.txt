The actual command or code to be executed is hidden within the base64 string, which is currently represented as 'CODE_REPLACE'. When the package is installed or developed, the `notmalfunc()` function is invoked during the installation process, executing arbitrary code on the host system. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands or payloads without user consent or awareness, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malicious actions.",
