      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be heavily obfuscated, likely using a code protector or obfuscator (e.g., pyarmor), which is common in malicious scripts to hide their true intent. The presence of a function call like __pyarmor__ with a large binary blob suggests that the script is designed to conceal malicious payloads or behaviors. Such obfuscation is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection and analysis. Without deobfuscation or execution, it is highly probable that this code contains malicious behavior, potentially including remote command and control, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities.",
