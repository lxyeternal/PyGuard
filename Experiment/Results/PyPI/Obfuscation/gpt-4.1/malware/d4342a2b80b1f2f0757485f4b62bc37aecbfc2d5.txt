      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload, when decoded, runs PowerShell to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory and then executing it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup metadata) is intended to evade detection. The code is designed to run as part of a Python package installation, making it especially dangerous as it could be distributed via a package repository and executed on unsuspecting users' machines.",
