      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be an obfuscated or intentionally malformed setup script that references suspicious variable names and potentially malicious dependencies. The presence of nonsensical variable names and unusual package list entries suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The inclusion of common package dependencies like 'requests', 'sockets', 'pycryptodome', and 'uuid' could be used to facilitate malicious activities such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or cryptographic operations for malicious purposes. Overall, the code's obfuscation and suspicious structure indicate it is likely malicious, aiming to disguise malicious behavior under the guise of a legitimate setup script.",

It includes functions to steal cookies from Chrome's local storage, extract sensitive data such as encrypted passwords, and send screenshots of the user's screen. It also attempts to send the user's cookies and system information to a remote Discord channel, effectively acting as a remote access trojan (RAT) and information stealer. The presence of obfuscated variable names, the use of Discord for command and control, and the capability to exfiltrate sensitive data confirm malicious behavior aimed at compromising user privacy and security.",
