      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and encrypted segments that, when decoded, execute dynamically compiled code via 'exec' on base64-decoded data. This pattern is typical of malicious scripts designed to hide their true intent. The initial base64 string decodes to code that imports modules, executes further code, and potentially runs arbitrary commands or payloads. Additionally, the code includes functions for terminal manipulation, cursor hiding, and complex string operations, which are often used to create deceptive or stealthy behaviors. Overall, the code's structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, likely to execute hidden or harmful operations on the host system.",
