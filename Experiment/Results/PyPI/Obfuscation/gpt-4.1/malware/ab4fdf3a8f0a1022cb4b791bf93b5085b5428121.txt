      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious intent. It clones remote repositories from GitHub into startup directories, which can be used to persist malicious payloads or backdoors on the victim's machine. It then moves a script ('test.py') into a startup folder, ensuring it executes on system startup. Additionally, it launches an executable ('main.exe') from a hidden or persistent location. These behaviors are characteristic of malware designed to establish persistence, execute malicious code automatically, and potentially control or exfiltrate data from the compromised system.",
