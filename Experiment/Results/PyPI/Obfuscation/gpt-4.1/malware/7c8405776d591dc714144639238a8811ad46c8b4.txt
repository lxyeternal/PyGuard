      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The code checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command in hidden mode. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup code) further indicates malicious intent. The setup() call is a decoy to make the script appear as a legitimate Python package setup script.",
