      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It is a disguised Python package setup script that, when installed or imported (except during 'sdist' source distribution), executes a large, obfuscated, base64-encoded payload. The payload is different for Windows and non-Windows systems, and both are designed to perform harmful actions:\n\n1. **Windows Payload**: The decoded base64 string is a Windows PE executable (as seen by the MZ header and binary data). The script writes this binary to a temporary directory as a .exe file and attempts to execute it. The binary itself is not analyzed here, but dropping and running an unknown executable is a classic malware technique, often used for backdoors, ransomware, or other forms of system compromise.\n\n2. **Non-Windows Payload**: The base64 string decodes to a Python script that:\n   - Imports a wide range of modules for system, file, network, and cryptographic operations.\n   - Contains code to search for browser data, cookies, and configuration files for browsers like Firefox, Chrome, and Telegram, as well as other sensitive files (wallets, config, etc.).\n   - Steals credentials, cookies, and other sensitive data from the victim's machine.\n   - Exfiltrates the stolen data to a remote server via HTTP POST requests (e.g., to api.telegram.org or other endpoints).\n   - Uses obfuscation, anti-analysis, and anti-debugging techniques (e.g., try/except, dynamic imports, encoded strings).\n   - May attempt to persist or further propagate itself.\n\n**Purpose and Harm**: The code is a classic info-stealer/backdoor. It is designed to steal sensitive information (passwords, cookies, browser data, cryptocurrency wallets, Telegram sessions, etc.) and send it to an attacker-controlled server. It may also drop and execute additional malware. This can lead to identity theft, financial loss, further system compromise, and use of the victim's machine in larger attacks (e.g., botnets).\n\n**Conclusion**: This is a highly dangerous, malicious Python package that should not be run under any circumstances. It is designed to steal data and compromise the victim's system.",
