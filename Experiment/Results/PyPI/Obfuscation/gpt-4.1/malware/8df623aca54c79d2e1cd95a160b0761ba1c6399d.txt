      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It downloads two executable files (ZYXMN.exe and ZYRBX.exe) from hardcoded Discord CDN URLs, saves them to disk, renames them to appear as Windows system files in a hidden directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), and then executes both files using os.startfile. After execution, it attempts to clean up by deleting the temporary directory. This behavior is typical of a dropper or loader malware, which is designed to fetch and run additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names, the creation of a suspiciously named directory, and the execution of unknown binaries from the internet all indicate clear malicious intent. The code could result in the compromise of the victim's system, data theft, or further malware infection.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code downloads an executable file ('main.exe') from a remote URL (hosted on Discord's CDN), saves it to disk, moves it to a hidden system-like directory ('C:\\$Windows.~SXK\\XMICNEI.exe'), and then executes it. This behavior is characteristic of a dropper or downloader malware, which is used to fetch and run potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. The use of a suspicious directory name mimicking Windows system folders is an attempt to evade detection. The code does not verify the contents or origin of the downloaded file, and running arbitrary executables from the internet poses a severe security risk, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
