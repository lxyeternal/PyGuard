      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, as indicated by the presence of a URL-like string within the encoded command. Additionally, the script creates a setup configuration with arbitrary package details, which may serve as a decoy or to blend malicious activity with legitimate package setup. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution combined with the context suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution or malware download.",
