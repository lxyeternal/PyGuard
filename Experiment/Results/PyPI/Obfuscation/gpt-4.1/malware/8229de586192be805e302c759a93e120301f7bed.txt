      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to obfuscate its true purpose through multiple layers of decoding and decompression. It uses base64, string reversal, zlib decompression, and marshaling to reconstruct and execute potentially harmful code dynamically. This pattern is typical of malware or malicious scripts aiming to hide their behavior from static analysis. The decoded payload likely contains malicious instructions such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or other harmful activities. Overall, the code exhibits clear malicious intent by employing obfuscation techniques to conceal its true operations and execute arbitrary code.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to obfuscate its true purpose by decoding and executing a payload that is heavily encoded and compressed. It uses base64, string reversal, zlib decompression, and marshal loading to conceal malicious instructions. The payload, once decoded, is likely to execute arbitrary code, potentially downloading, installing, or executing malicious payloads, or performing unauthorized actions on the host system. This level of obfuscation and dynamic code execution strongly indicates malicious intent, aimed at evading detection and executing harmful operations.",
