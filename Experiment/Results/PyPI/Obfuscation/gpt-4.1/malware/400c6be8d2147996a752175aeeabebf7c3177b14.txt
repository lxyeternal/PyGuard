      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to fetch and execute a script from an external URL ('https://sharetext.me/raw/gf8pcwkix5') using the requests library. This behavior is highly suspicious because it allows remote code execution, which can be used to run arbitrary malicious code on the host system. Additionally, the code installs the 'requests' library if it is not already present, which is a common tactic to ensure the environment can perform the malicious fetch. Overall, this pattern indicates malicious intent, as it enables remote control or execution of harmful code without user consent.",
