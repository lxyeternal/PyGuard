      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs network reconnaissance and exfiltration activities. It retrieves the host's IP address using proxy configurations, resolves DNS records for a specified domain, and generates a SHA-1 hash of combined system and network information. It then encodes this data into a hex string, segments it, and resolves each segment as a DNS query to an external server (notably 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net'). This pattern indicates data exfiltration via DNS tunneling, a common technique used by malware to stealthily transmit information from an infected host to an attacker-controlled server. Additionally, the code's final print statement suggests it is a security test, but the core behavior aligns with malicious data exfiltration activities.",
