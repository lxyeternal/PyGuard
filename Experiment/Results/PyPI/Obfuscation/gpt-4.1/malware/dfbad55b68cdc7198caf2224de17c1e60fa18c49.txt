It collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the current username (os.getlogin()), the hostname (platform.node()), detailed system information (platform.uname()), the current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the local IP address (by creating a UDP socket to 8.8.8.8 and reading the local socket address). It then concatenates this information, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (http://162.62.15.24/v/...). This exfiltration of system and user information to an external server is a clear indicator of malicious intent, as it compromises the privacy and security of the affected system. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks via Python packages.",
