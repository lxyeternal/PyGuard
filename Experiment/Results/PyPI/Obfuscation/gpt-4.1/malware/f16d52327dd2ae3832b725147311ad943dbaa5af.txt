This behavior indicates an attempt to contact a remote server, potentially to download malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or trigger malicious actions. The use of a suspicious URL and the context of fetching a PHP script from an external source are common indicators of malicious activity, such as command-and-control communication or deploying malware.",
