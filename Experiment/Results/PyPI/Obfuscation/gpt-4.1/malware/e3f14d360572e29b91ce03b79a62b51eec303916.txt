      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a remote GitHub repository (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic dropper/downloader behavior, commonly used to infect systems with malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to evade detection and execute potentially harmful code without user consent. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script.",
