      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. It attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package if not present, which is often used for Windows COM automation. More concerningly, it creates a directory within the user's AppData folder and writes a 'background.js' JavaScript file containing obfuscated code that appears to be designed for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information or executing malicious scripts within a browser context. Additionally, it creates a 'manifest.json' to load this extension into Chrome or similar browsers. The script then searches for shortcut files (.lnk) across common user directories and modifies their target shortcuts for specific browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave) to include a command-line argument that loads the malicious extension. This behavior indicates an attempt to persistently inject malicious code into the user's browser environment, potentially enabling data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities. Overall, these actions are characteristic of malware or a malicious payload aimed at compromising user security and privacy.",
