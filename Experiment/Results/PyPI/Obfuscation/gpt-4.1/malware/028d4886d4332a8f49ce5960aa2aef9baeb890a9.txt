      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the installation process, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, and username, and then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server ('https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/'). This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration or reconnaissance, which is typical in malicious activities. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks beyond this data collection and transmission, indicating it is designed to surreptitiously gather and send user environment information without user consent.",
