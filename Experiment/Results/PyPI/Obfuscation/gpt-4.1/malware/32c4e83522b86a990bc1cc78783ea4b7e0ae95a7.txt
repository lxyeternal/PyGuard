      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs obfuscated payloads by encoding system information (hostname, username, current directory) into hexadecimal strings, then further encodes these into base64. It then uses these encoded strings to generate command-line commands and URL parameters. The script attempts to send this data to a remote server via multiple HTTP requests (both GET and POST) using different libraries (urllib, requests). The use of obfuscation, data collection of system info, and transmission to an external server strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for data exfiltration, command and control, or tracking purposes. The code's behavior aligns with typical malware or spyware activity designed to stealthily gather and transmit system information.",
