      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes a ZIP archive from an external URL, extracts it to a system directory, and then runs a script (likely 'server.pyw') using a hidden process. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently install potentially malicious payloads onto the system, which can be used for remote control, data theft, or other malicious activities. The use of PowerShell commands to fetch and extract files, combined with executing scripts without user consent, strongly suggests malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that execute system commands to manipulate the console environment, such as clearing the screen, setting window titles, and hiding/showing the cursor. It also includes obfuscated and complex functions that generate animated or stylized terminal output, which can be used to disguise malicious activity or create deceptive interfaces. The presence of functions that perform system calls, manipulate terminal display, and the overall obfuscated structure strongly suggest intent to conceal malicious behavior, such as hiding malicious payloads or creating misleading user interfaces. Additionally, the code references a 'developer area' and contains functions with ambiguous or intentionally confusing names, indicating an attempt to obfuscate malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to manipulate the terminal and potentially hide or execute malicious actions, classifying it as malicious.",
