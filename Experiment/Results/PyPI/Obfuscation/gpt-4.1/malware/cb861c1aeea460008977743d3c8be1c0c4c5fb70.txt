It creates a socket connection and spawns an interactive bash shell, redirecting its input and output through the socket. This behavior allows an attacker to remotely control the compromised system, execute arbitrary commands, and potentially cause harm or exfiltrate data. The infinite loop following the connection setup appears to be a placeholder or an attempt to keep the script running, but the core malicious activity is the reverse shell establishment.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decodes and executes a base64-encoded string, which likely contains malicious instructions. The presence of 'exec' with decoded code suggests an attempt to run hidden or malicious code at runtime. This behavior is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to conceal their true intent, potentially leading to unauthorized actions such as data theft, system compromise, or remote code execution.",
