      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor mechanism that connects to an external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090 and transmits system uptime and platform information. This behavior suggests data exfiltration or remote command/control capabilities, which are typical malicious activities. Additionally, the code is obfuscated with nonsensical variable names, indicating an attempt to conceal its true purpose. The use of a custom install command within a setup script to execute this behavior further supports malicious intent, as it could be embedded in a seemingly legitimate package to infect systems during installation.",
