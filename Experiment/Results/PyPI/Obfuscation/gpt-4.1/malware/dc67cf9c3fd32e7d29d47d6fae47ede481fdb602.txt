      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The code checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command in hidden mode (using -WindowStyle Hidden and subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW) to download and execute a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as '~/WindowsCache.exe', and then executes it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is a common first stage in malware infections. The use of obfuscation (base64-encoded PowerShell) and silent execution are clear indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to make the file look like a legitimate Python package setup script.",
