      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (hevLVWdhQoUkmMrJptzdlNJpzPNRrSgI) that, when run on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' libraries and then executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code, such as downloading and running additional malware, stealing data, or creating backdoors. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and execution during the install process are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code will execute automatically when the package is installed, potentially compromising the system.",
