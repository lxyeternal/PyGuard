      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed at install time, making static analysis difficult. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a common obfuscation and evasion technique in malware. The payload could perform any arbitrary action, such as data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or system compromise. The code is designed to execute only on Windows, further indicating targeted malicious intent. The use of misleading variable names and obfuscated logic further supports the conclusion that this is malicious code.",
