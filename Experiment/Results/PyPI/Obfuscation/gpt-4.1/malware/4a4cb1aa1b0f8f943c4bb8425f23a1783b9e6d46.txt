      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (rFDBbDvtHqpCffVlrrVMiXCBtPumvWEK) that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, credential stealers, or downloaders, on the victim's machine. The code is specifically designed to target Windows systems and will execute the hidden payload as soon as the package is installed, potentially compromising the system. The obfuscated variable names and encrypted payload further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis.",
