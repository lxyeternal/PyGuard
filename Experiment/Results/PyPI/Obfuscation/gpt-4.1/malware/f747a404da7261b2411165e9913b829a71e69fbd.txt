      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered (such as during package installation), collects sensitive information from the victim's system, including the operating system details, current working directory, network configuration, public IP address, current user, and hostname. It then sends all this information to a hardcoded external Slack webhook (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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). This is a classic example of an information-stealing backdoor embedded in a Python package. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, as well as the abuse of the setuptools install process, are clear indicators of malicious intent. The potential harm includes unauthorized exfiltration of system and network information, which could be used for further attacks or reconnaissance.",
