It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered during package installation, collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://9.30.214.68:9090), which is a classic data exfiltration technique. This behavior is hidden within the installation process, making it stealthy and potentially harmful, as it leaks private system information without user consent.",
