      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. It attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package if not present, which is often used for Windows COM automation. More notably, it creates a directory within the user's AppData folder and writes a 'background.js' JavaScript file containing obfuscated code that appears to monitor or manipulate browser activity, potentially for malicious purposes such as data theft or unauthorized access. Additionally, it creates a 'manifest.json' to load this extension into Chrome or similar browsers. The script then searches for shortcut files (.lnk) across common user directories and modifies their target shortcuts to include a command-line argument that loads the malicious extension. This behavior indicates an attempt to persistently inject malicious browser extensions and potentially hijack user sessions or steal sensitive information, which is characteristic of malware or spyware.",
