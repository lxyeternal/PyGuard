      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (TTiTPhkDEKfoLKJeuXmyVWzfLCBYOigH) that, when the package is installed on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is not visible in the code, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, credential stealers, or downloaders, on the victim's machine. The obfuscated variable and class names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The code only triggers on Windows systems, likely to target a specific user base. This package, if installed, could compromise the security and integrity of the affected system.",
