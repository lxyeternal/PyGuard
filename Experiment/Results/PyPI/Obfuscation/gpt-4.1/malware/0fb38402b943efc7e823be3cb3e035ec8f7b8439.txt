      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and employs multiple layers of decoding and dynamic execution (via `exec`). It decodes a large base64-encoded string, which is then decoded into ASCII, and subsequently executed. The code also includes a complex character mapping that transforms a string into another form before decoding. Such techniques are characteristic of malicious scripts designed to hide their true intent, often to execute arbitrary or harmful payloads, such as malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. The use of `exec` on dynamically decoded data is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows the code to run obfuscated or encrypted payloads without easy detection. Overall, this code appears to be malicious, aiming to conceal its true purpose and execute potentially harmful operations.",
