      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making static analysis difficult and hiding its true intent. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. This technique is commonly used to deliver malware, steal information, or establish backdoors. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis.",
