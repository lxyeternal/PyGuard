      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden function that, on macOS systems, collects system information such as uname, user ID, current directory, and network configuration. It then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via a curl command to an external IP address (81.70.191.194) over a short timeout (3 seconds). This behavior indicates data exfiltration without user consent, which is malicious. Additionally, the code's obfuscated variable names and the use of system commands suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The setup configuration appears legitimate but is likely a cover for the malicious data collection and exfiltration activity.",
