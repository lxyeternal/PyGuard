Specifically, it performs an HTTP GET request to a Pastebin URL and posts the retrieved content to a Discord webhook (or similar service) with a message indicating a 'new run @everyone', which can be used for spam or notification of unauthorized activity. Additionally, it downloads another script from a suspicious URL ('https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode'), saves it locally with a random filename, and then executes it via subprocess. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially malicious code on the host system, which could be used for remote control, data theft, or further malware deployment.",
