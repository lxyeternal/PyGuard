      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during package setup, performs several suspicious actions. It collects system information such as hostname, current directory, and user name. It attempts to create a file at '/root/j0j0.poc', which may be used as a marker or trigger. It then gathers directory listings from multiple system directories ('/', '/etc/', '/home/', '/mnt/', '/rasp/') and sends this information via HTTP POST requests to an external domain ('https://j0j0.xyz/lists/...'). Additionally, it reads sensitive system files (e.g., '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', '/var/lib/docker/containers/container-id/config.v2.json') and uploads their contents to the same external server. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information and files, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as espionage, malware, or backdoor setup. The code is designed to run during package installation, making it stealthy and potentially difficult to detect.",
