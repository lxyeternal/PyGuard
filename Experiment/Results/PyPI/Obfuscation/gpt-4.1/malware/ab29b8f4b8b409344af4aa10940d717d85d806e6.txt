      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that overrides the installation process to execute a PowerShell command that establishes a reverse TCP connection to an external IP address (81.68.184.99) on port 6784. This command creates a remote shell, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the infected machine. Such behavior is characteristic of a backdoor or remote access trojan (RAT), enabling unauthorized control and potential data exfiltration. The use of obfuscated class and method names further suggests malicious intent to evade detection.",
