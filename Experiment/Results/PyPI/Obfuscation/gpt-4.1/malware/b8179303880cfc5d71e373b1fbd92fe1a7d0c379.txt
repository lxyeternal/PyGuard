      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is a setup script for a Python package named 'zeufuefsyepo344z'. While the script itself does not directly perform any malicious actions, it specifies dependencies that are highly suspicious in the context of malware: 'browser_cookie3' (used to extract browser cookies), 'discordwebhook' (commonly used to exfiltrate data to Discord), 'robloxpy' (often used in malicious scripts targeting Roblox users), and 'requests' (used for HTTP requests, often for data exfiltration). The combination of these dependencies is a strong indicator of a package designed to steal sensitive information (such as browser cookies, authentication tokens, or Roblox credentials) and send it to an attacker via Discord webhooks. This pattern is commonly seen in credential-stealing malware distributed via malicious Python packages. Therefore, the code is considered malicious due to its clear intent to facilitate information theft.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. Its primary purpose is to steal the user's Roblox authentication cookie (.ROBLOSECURITY) from various browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Opera) using the browser_cookie3 library. It then validates the cookie, collects sensitive account information (username, Robux balance, account age, friends, premium status, etc.), and sends all of this data, including the authentication cookie and the user's public IP address, to a hardcoded Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account and potentially cause financial and reputational harm. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names to hinder analysis and detection.",
