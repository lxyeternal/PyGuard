      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity, including: \n- Data exfiltration: It collects sensitive user information such as Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other credentials from various browsers and applications.\n- Credential theft: It accesses and extracts stored passwords, cookies, and login data from browsers and other applications like Steam, Telegram, and wallet applications.\n- Data exfiltration via webhooks: It sends the collected data to a specified Discord webhook URL, indicating active data theft and remote data exfiltration.\n- Persistence and stealth: It searches user directories, browser data, and application files, often copying and zipping sensitive files, and may attempt to kill processes (e.g., kill browser or wallet processes) to facilitate data collection.\n- Potential keylogging or credential harvesting: The code interacts with encrypted data, decrypts stored passwords, and may be designed to harvest login credentials.\nOverall, the code is designed to steal user credentials, cookies, and sensitive data, then send it to an attacker-controlled webhook, which is characteristic of malware such as info-stealers or remote access trojans (RATs).",
