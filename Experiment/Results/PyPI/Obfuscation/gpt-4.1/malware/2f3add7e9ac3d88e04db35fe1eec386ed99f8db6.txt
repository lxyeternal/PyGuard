      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (AKrTnbHHJaPpfLeirXwNJIfFWpkparUC) that, when the package is installed on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, which is decrypted at install time and executed via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making it difficult to detect by static analysis. The use of obfuscated variable names and encrypted payloads is a strong indicator of intent to evade detection. The actual decrypted payload is not visible in the provided code, but the pattern is consistent with malware that could steal data, install backdoors, or perform other harmful actions on the victim's machine.",
