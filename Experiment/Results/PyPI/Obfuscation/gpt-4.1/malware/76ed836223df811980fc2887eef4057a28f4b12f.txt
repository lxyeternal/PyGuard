      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing malware on a victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common method to evade detection by running the process in the background without a visible window. The code also checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' as a simple persistence or execution guard. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup. This code is designed to compromise the system by downloading and running potentially harmful executable code from the internet.",
