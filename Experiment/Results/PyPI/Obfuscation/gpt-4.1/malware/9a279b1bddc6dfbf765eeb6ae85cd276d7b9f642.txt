      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic remote code execution and malware delivery technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' ensures the process is hidden from the user, making detection harder. The code also tries to avoid re-execution by checking for the existence of a 'tahg' file or directory. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This behavior is highly dangerous as it can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
