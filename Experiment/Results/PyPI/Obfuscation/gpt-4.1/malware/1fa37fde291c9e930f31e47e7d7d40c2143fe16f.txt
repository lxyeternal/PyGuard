      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute an external command 'py -m perlreq' via subprocess.call with shell=True, which can be exploited to run arbitrary commands if the input is manipulated. Additionally, the code imports and calls a module named 'perlreq' without any apparent legitimate purpose, and the package name 'nxxdq3v48puzdinn' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is often a sign of malicious intent. The combination of obfuscated naming, the use of subprocess with shell=True, and the execution of an external module suggests that this code is designed to perform malicious activities such as executing arbitrary code, potentially downloading or executing malicious payloads, or establishing unauthorized control.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to execute obfuscated malicious payloads. It uses a lambda function to dynamically import modules ('zlib' and 'base64'), decode and decompress an embedded payload, and then execute it via 'exec'. The payload itself is heavily obfuscated through base64 encoding, string reversal, and zlib compression, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. Such behavior indicates the code is intended to run hidden, potentially harmful operations, such as installing malware, stealing data, or establishing unauthorized access.",

It uses a lambda function to dynamically import 'zlib' and 'base64', then reverses and decodes a base64-encoded string, decompresses it, and executes the resulting code via 'exec'. This pattern is typical of malware or malicious scripts attempting to hide their true intent. The payload likely performs harmful actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious activities once decoded and executed. The use of string reversal, base64 decoding, decompression, and dynamic execution indicates an intent to evade detection and analysis.",
