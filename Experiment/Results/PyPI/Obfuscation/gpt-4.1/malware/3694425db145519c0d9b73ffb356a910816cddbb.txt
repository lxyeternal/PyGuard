      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information without user consent. It gathers hostname, current working directory, username, local IP addresses, and network interface details. It then encodes and obfuscates this data, constructs a suspicious URL with encoded components, and sends the information via an HTTP POST request to an external server ('https://425a2.rt11.ml'). This behavior indicates data theft and potential command-and-control communication, characteristic of malware or spyware. The code also employs obfuscation techniques, such as hex encoding and dynamic string manipulation, to evade detection.",
