      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. The decoded payload is highly obfuscated and appears to be a complex, encrypted or encoded script designed to perform malicious activities such as establishing unauthorized communication, data exfiltration, or executing further malicious payloads. The use of base64 decoding combined with `exec()` is a common technique to hide malicious intent, making it difficult to analyze statically. Overall, this code is malicious because it actively executes hidden, potentially harmful code without transparency or user consent.",
