      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (DucEHpLOybLwkSsxDKYPREwFRfZXLafG) that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making static analysis difficult and hiding its true intent. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a classic technique for running arbitrary, potentially harmful code (such as downloading and executing malware, stealing data, or creating backdoors) during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of supply chain attacks via malicious Python packages. The obfuscated variable names and unnecessary complexity further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
