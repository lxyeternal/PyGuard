      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It creates a temporary Python file containing code that downloads and executes a remote Python script from 'https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw' using urllib. It then attempts to execute this file using the Pythonw interpreter (pythonw.exe) in a new process, which runs Python scripts without a console window, making the execution stealthy. This behavior is a classic example of a 'downloader' or 'dropper', where the initial code fetches and runs additional code from the internet, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This can lead to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The use of obfuscated variable names and the abuse of the setup.py installation process further indicate an attempt to evade detection and target users installing Python packages.",
