      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command (when decoded) downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which can be used to deliver further malware to the victim's system. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup metadata) is intended to evade detection and analysis. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script appear as a legitimate Python package setup file.",
