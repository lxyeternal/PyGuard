      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes remote scripts and binaries from external sources, which is a common tactic used in malware delivery. Specifically, it downloads a batch file from a GitHub URL and executes it, then downloads and runs a shell script from another URL. These actions can be used to install malicious software, such as miners, backdoors, or other malware, on the victim's system. The use of PowerShell and curl/wget commands to fetch and execute remote code without user consent indicates malicious intent, as it can lead to system compromise, data theft, or resource hijacking.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes remote scripts and downloads files from a suspicious URL, then executes a downloaded batch file. Specifically, it runs a PowerShell command to download a batch script from a GitHub URL and executes it, which could be used to install malware, cryptominers, or perform other malicious activities. Additionally, it downloads and executes a shell script via curl, which may also contain malicious payloads. These behaviors indicate an attempt to silently download and execute potentially harmful code, making this code malicious.",
