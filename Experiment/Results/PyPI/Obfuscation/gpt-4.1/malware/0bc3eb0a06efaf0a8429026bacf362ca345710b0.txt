      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of malware droppers, which are used to download and execute additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, misleading variable names, and hidden execution) is intended to evade detection by users and security software. The code also checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' as a simple persistence or execution guard. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup. This code can compromise the security and integrity of the affected system.",
