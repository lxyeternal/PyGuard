      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a class that, during installation, executes a decryption of an embedded encrypted payload using Fernet. If the operating system is Windows ('nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts a hardcoded encrypted string, and executes the resulting code via 'exec'. This behavior indicates an attempt to run arbitrary code during installation, which is a common tactic for malicious payload delivery. The use of encrypted payloads and conditional execution on Windows suggests an intent to hide malicious activity and target specific environments, making this code malicious.",
