      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. It decodes and executes obfuscated base64-encoded code, which likely contains malicious payloads. It checks for the existence of a system directory ('C:/ProgramData/Updater') and proceeds to download a ZIP file from a remote URL, extract it, and execute a PowerShell command that installs numerous potentially malicious Python packages silently. Additionally, it runs a VBScript and a hidden Python process, possibly to establish persistence or perform further malicious activities. The use of obfuscation, silent downloads, and execution of remote scripts strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at compromising the system, installing backdoors, or maintaining persistence.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and complex functions that appear designed to perform malicious activities such as manipulating console output, creating deceptive visual effects, and potentially executing commands or hiding malicious payloads. The presence of functions with misleading names, extensive use of string manipulation, and the inclusion of code that can hide the cursor or create animated text effects suggest an intent to deceive or distract. Additionally, the code's structure and variable naming conventions indicate it may be part of a larger malicious script aimed at obfuscation, possibly to evade detection or analysis. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious scripts, including concealment, deception, and potential command execution.",
