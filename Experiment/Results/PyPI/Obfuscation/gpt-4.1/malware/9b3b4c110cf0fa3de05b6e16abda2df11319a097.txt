      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple malicious behaviors characteristic of information stealers and malware. It attempts to extract sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and browser credentials by accessing local storage, databases, and encrypted files from various browsers and applications. It then compresses and exfiltrates this data to remote servers or Discord webhooks, effectively stealing user credentials, session tokens, and personal information. Additionally, it includes functions for killing processes, capturing screenshots, and uploading files to third-party services, all typical of malware designed for data theft, credential harvesting, and remote control. The code also installs dependencies silently, indicating an intent to evade detection and maintain persistence. Overall, the script is designed to covertly collect and transmit private user data, which is malicious behavior.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a function with an obfuscated name from a module named 'module.pytoolib' and immediately executes it with the argument 'boolean'. The obfuscated naming and the immediate invocation suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, such as executing hidden payloads, establishing backdoors, or performing unauthorized actions. Without access to the implementation of 'IUOCZmJRhWyhkGhhqjbRabLbYKuKHuWK', it is highly suspicious and likely malicious, as such obfuscation is a common tactic used by malware to evade detection and perform harmful activities.",
