      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a Windows executable (Esquele.exe) from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic remote code execution and malware delivery technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags and encoded PowerShell is designed to evade detection. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to appear as a legitimate Python package setup script. This code can compromise the system by running arbitrary code from the internet, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation.",
