It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that, when triggered (i.e., when the package is installed or developed), execute the function xRuTWflEcJnzYxDfWkqPZdhnRPdQZpWh. This function collects all environment variables from the victim's system (using os.environ), prints them (which could be a decoy), and then exfiltrates them by sending an HTTP POST request to a remote server (https://webhook.site/8f782c5b-990f-4d3d-94cc-fd128b873693). Environment variables often contain sensitive information such as API keys, credentials, and other secrets. This behavior is a clear example of credential theft and data exfiltration, which is a common goal of malicious software. The obfuscated variable and class names further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
