      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (HgsQDopxTvNFEjjRrXgIANChsJeypVCV) that, during package installation, constructs a URL from obfuscated string fragments and downloads a remote Python file (qrcodegen.py) from that URL. It then writes this file to disk and executes it using the current Python interpreter. This behavior is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution from a remote source during installation, bypassing any code review or package repository controls. The obfuscation of variable names and URL construction is a common technique to evade detection. The downloaded code could perform any malicious action, such as stealing data, installing backdoors, or compromising the system. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack vector in Python packages.",
