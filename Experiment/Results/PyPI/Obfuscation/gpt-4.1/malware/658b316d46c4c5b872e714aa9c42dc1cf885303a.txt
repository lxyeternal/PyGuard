      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and malicious behavior: it executes a remote command via 'curl' piped directly into '/bin/bash', which downloads and runs an external script from an IP address (http://108.61.251.172:8080/revssh/108.61.251.172/2222). This action can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary commands on the host system, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activities. The rest of the code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging and publishing a Python project, but the initial remote script execution is a clear indicator of malicious intent.",
