      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, constructs a URL (obfuscated via string concatenation) and downloads a remote Python file named 'qrcodegen.py' from that URL using the requests library. It then writes this file to disk and immediately executes it using subprocess and the current Python interpreter. This behavior is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows the package author to execute arbitrary code on the installer's machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The obfuscation of the URL and the use of a remote script are classic indicators of a supply chain attack. The code does not inform the user or require consent, and the downloaded code could change at any time, making this a severe security risk.",
