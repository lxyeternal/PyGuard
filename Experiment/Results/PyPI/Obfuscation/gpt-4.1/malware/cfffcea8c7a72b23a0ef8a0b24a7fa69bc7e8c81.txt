      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (oJMcMvAIKSoXDclckMsXmKVATnOMvWHR) that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' libraries, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, which is decrypted with a hardcoded key and executed via exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide the true intent of the code and evade static analysis. The decrypted payload could perform any action, such as downloading and executing further malware, stealing data, or creating backdoors. The use of obfuscated variable names and encrypted code strongly indicates an attempt to conceal malicious activity. Additionally, the code is triggered during package installation, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks.",
