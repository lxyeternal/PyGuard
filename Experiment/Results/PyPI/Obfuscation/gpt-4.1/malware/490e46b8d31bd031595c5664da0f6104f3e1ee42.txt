      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the installation process, constructs a reverse shell payload targeting IP 13.93.28.37 on port 1337. It encodes this payload in base64 and executes it via a shell command, which establishes a remote connection to the attacker's server, providing them with shell access. This behavior is characteristic of malicious activity, as it allows unauthorized remote control of the system during package installation, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malicious actions.",
