      "malicious_behavior": "This code downloads a Windows executable file (PythonLIB_1.exe) from a remote server (hosted on Discord's CDN) and saves it as 'explorer.exe' in the user's AppData\\Local directory. It then attempts to execute this file. This behavior is highly indicative of malware, as it can be used to deliver and run arbitrary malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of a misleading filename ('explorer.exe') and a location commonly used by legitimate system files increases the likelihood of evading detection. The code does not verify the integrity or safety of the downloaded file, and running executables from untrusted sources is a major security risk. This is a classic pattern for a dropper or downloader malware.",
