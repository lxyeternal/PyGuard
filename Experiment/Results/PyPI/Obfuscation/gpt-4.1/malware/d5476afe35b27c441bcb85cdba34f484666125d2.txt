      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to fetch and execute additional malware on the victim's machine. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded command, as well as the obfuscation, are clear indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy (a normal setup() call) to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
