      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and highly complex constructs that appear designed to hide malicious intent. It employs dynamic code execution (`exec`, `eval`, `compile`, `import`), convoluted string manipulations, and nested lambda functions that decompress and evaluate code at runtime. The presence of large, seemingly random byte strings and obfuscated function calls strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious payloads, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or payload delivery. The overall structure and techniques are characteristic of malware or backdoor scripts aiming to evade detection and execute harmful operations dynamically.",
