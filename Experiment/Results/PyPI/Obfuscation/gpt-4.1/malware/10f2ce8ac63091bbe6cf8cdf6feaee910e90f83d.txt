      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden' to avoid alerting the user. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is a common first stage in malware infections. The code is designed to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window and only running if a specific file does not exist. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup. This code can compromise the system by downloading and executing arbitrary code from the internet, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation.",
