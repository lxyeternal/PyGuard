      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate its true behavior and then executes the decoded code using exec(). Upon decoding, the code performs the following actions: (1) It constructs a URL (http://update.win10updata.com/QQVersion.exe) and downloads an executable file from this remote server using the requests library. (2) It saves the downloaded file as 'QQVersion<random_name>.exe' in a directory named 'C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\QQVersion<random_name>.exe'. (3) It then executes this file using subprocess.Popen. Placing an executable in the Windows Startup folder ensures that the malicious payload will run automatically every time the system starts, achieving persistence. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to download and execute additional malicious payloads, potentially leading to further compromise of the system, data theft, or other harmful actions.",
