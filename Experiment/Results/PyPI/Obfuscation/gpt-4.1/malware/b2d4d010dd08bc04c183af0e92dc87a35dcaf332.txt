      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command with an encoded payload, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activities such as downloading or executing malicious scripts, establishing backdoors, or exfiltrating data. The encoded command is likely obfuscated to evade detection. Additionally, the script creates a Windows process with hidden window flags, further indicating an intent to operate covertly. The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell command execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as it is a typical tactic used in malware or malicious scripts to perform harmful actions without user awareness.",
