      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (AapgxHWeWFBhNzZpiqRqglsDLtdVlNPs) that, when triggered during package installation, collects sensitive information from the victim's machine: the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is a data exfiltration technique. This behavior is stealthy, as it is embedded in the installation process and uses obfuscated class and variable names to evade detection. The purpose is to leak identifying information about the victim's environment to an attacker-controlled server, which can be used for reconnaissance or further attacks.",
