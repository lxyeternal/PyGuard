      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity. It gathers system information such as hostname, username, and current directory, then encodes this data in base64, further obfuscating it. It constructs a specially crafted string that appears to be a command or payload, which it then attempts to ping using system calls, likely as a covert communication or reconnaissance method. Additionally, it encodes the data into hexadecimal strings and sends it to external servers via various HTTP requests (GET, POST) using multiple libraries (urllib, requests). The use of obfuscation, data exfiltration, and network communication to external servers strongly suggests malicious intent, such as data theft, command-and-control communication, or remote control of the compromised system.",
