      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded command, as well as the obfuscation and silent error handling, are all indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup.",
