      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden backdoor that establishes a remote shell connection to an attacker-controlled IP address (120.76.194.25) on port 1234. It writes a script ('remote-access.py') embedded within the code, saves it to the user's system, and attempts to execute it, enabling remote control over the compromised machine. The embedded script, when run, opens a network socket, and depending on the platform, creates a reverse shell (via cmd on Windows or bash on Linux), allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely. This behavior is characteristic of malicious remote access trojans (RATs) designed for unauthorized control, data theft, or system compromise.",
