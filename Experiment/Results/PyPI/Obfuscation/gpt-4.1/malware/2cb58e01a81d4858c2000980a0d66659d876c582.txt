      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload, when decoded, runs a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory and then executing it. This is a classic remote code execution and malware delivery technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' ensures the command runs without a visible window, making it stealthy. The code also uses exception handling to suppress errors and attempts to masquerade as a legitimate Python package setup script. This behavior is highly dangerous as it can lead to the compromise of the victim's system, data theft, or further malware propagation.",
