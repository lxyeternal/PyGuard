      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to download and execute a potentially malicious executable file from an external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) using PowerShell. It uses 'Invoke-WebRequest' to download the file to the user's system and then executes it, which is a common tactic for delivering malware or remote payloads. Additionally, the code tries to install the 'subprocess' module via pip if it is not available, which is unnecessary and suspicious, as 'subprocess' is a standard library module. Overall, this behavior indicates malicious intent, as it involves downloading and executing an external executable without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise or data theft.",
