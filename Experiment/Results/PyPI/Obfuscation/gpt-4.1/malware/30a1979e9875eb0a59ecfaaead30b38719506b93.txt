      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and is a sophisticated information stealer, commonly referred to as a 'stealer' or 'infostealer' malware. The code is designed to: \n\n1. **Steal Sensitive Data:**\n   - Extracts Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) and Discord installations.\n   - Decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs and browser master keys.\n   - Searches for files on the user's Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders with keywords related to passwords, wallets, backups, and other sensitive information.\n   - Steals cryptocurrency wallet data (e.g., Metamask, Exodus, Atomic Wallet) and gaming credentials (Steam, Riot, etc.).\n\n2. **Exfiltrate Data:**\n   - Uploads stolen files to remote servers (e.g., gofile.io) and sends download links and extracted data to a hardcoded Discord webhook (`AZKbGovgJzsITdsvvwCKICeDyVSDNOdK`).\n   - Sends detailed victim information (IP, geolocation, username, badges, billing info, etc.) to the attacker's Discord webhook.\n\n3. **Persistence:**\n   - Copies itself to the Windows Startup folder to ensure it runs on system boot, maintaining persistence on the victim's machine.\n\n4. **Self-Protection/Evasion:**\n   - Exits immediately if it detects certain usernames, hostnames, or MAC addresses, likely to avoid running in analysis environments or on developer/test machines.\n   - Kills Discord processes to ensure it can access and modify Discord files without interference.\n\n5. **Malicious Injection:**\n   - Downloads and overwrites Discord's `index.js` file with a remote script, enabling further code execution or token stealing when Discord is launched.\n\n6. **Abuse of Discord API:**\n   - Uses Discord's API to enumerate user relationships, badges, billing info, and more, further enriching the stolen data.\n\n7. **Backdoor/Remote Control:**\n   - Runs a Flask web server exposing endpoints that can be used to generate MFA codes, look up Discord user info, and even change Discord account passwords and MFA settings, providing the attacker with remote control capabilities over compromised accounts.\n\n**Potential Harm:**\n- Theft of personal and financial information, including passwords, cookies, crypto wallets, and sensitive documents.\n- Compromise of Discord accounts, including disabling MFA and changing passwords.\n- Loss of privacy, identity theft, and potential financial loss.\n- Use of the victim's machine as a foothold for further attacks.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis code is a full-featured, multi-purpose stealer/backdoor and is extremely dangerous. It should be considered highly malicious and must not be executed under any circumstances.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "This code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it uses obfuscated variable names and non-standard keyword arguments in the setup() function (e.g., 'JrsTvflVqpqyfggCizZjBZFyGyJVZRcX', 'onRqVVliTDcGCITuPIaTENirPYeQsvjs', 'KKULfykiZdPccftWyRScovHQcxVqXrst'). These are not recognized by setuptools and suggest an attempt to evade detection or analysis. The use of obfuscation in a setup script is a common tactic in malicious packages to hide their true intent. While this specific snippet does not directly execute malicious code, the obfuscation and non-standard usage strongly indicate an attempt to disguise the package's real behavior, which is a hallmark of malicious code distribution (such as typosquatting or supply chain attacks). Therefore, this code should be considered malicious or highly suspicious.",
