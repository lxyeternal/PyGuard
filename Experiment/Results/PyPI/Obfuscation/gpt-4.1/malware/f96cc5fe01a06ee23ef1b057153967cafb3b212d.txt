      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to fetch and execute additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and non-standard subprocess arguments) is intended to evade detection. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script appear as a legitimate Python package setup script. This code can compromise the system by running arbitrary code from the internet, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware infection.",
