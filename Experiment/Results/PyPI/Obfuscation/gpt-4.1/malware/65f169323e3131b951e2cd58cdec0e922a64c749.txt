      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple behaviors characteristic of advanced information-stealing malware (infostealer). The main malicious behaviors include:\n\n1. **Credential and Data Theft**: The code systematically searches for, decrypts, and exfiltrates sensitive user data from various browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, Yandex, etc.), including:\n   - Saved passwords (from 'Login Data' SQLite DBs)\n   - Cookies (from 'Cookies' DBs)\n   - Browser history\n   - Credit card information\n   - Discord tokens and session data\n   - Roblox cookies\n   - Minecraft and Steam account data\n\n2. **Clipboard Hijacking (Crypto Stealer)**: The code monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses (BTC, ETH, ADA, Monero, etc.) and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses, enabling theft of cryptocurrency during user transactions.\n\n3. **System Reconnaissance**: It collects detailed system information, including:\n   - Username, computer name, hardware ID (HWID)\n   - RAM and disk size\n   - Windows product key and version\n   - Public IP, geolocation, ISP, and Google Maps link\n   - Screenshot of the desktop\n\n4. **Persistence**: The code copies itself to the Windows Startup folder to ensure it runs on system boot, maintaining persistence on the victim's machine.\n\n5. **Anti-Analysis/Evasion**: It checks for the presence of analysis tools (Wireshark, Fiddler, Process Hacker, VMs, sandboxes, etc.) and attempts to terminate or evade them. It also kills Discord-related processes to bypass token protection.\n\n6. **Exfiltration**: All stolen data is compressed and sent to a remote server via a Discord webhook (https://kekwltd.ru/relay) and/or file upload services (transfer.sh). The code also sends system and token information as Discord embeds.\n\n7. **File Search and Exfiltration**: It recursively searches user folders (Desktop, Documents, Downloads) for files with keywords related to credentials, wallets, and other sensitive data, uploads them, and reports the links to the attacker.\n\n8. **Destructive Actions**: The code may delete or overwrite files after exfiltration to cover its tracks.\n\n9. **Obfuscation**: The code uses random and meaningless variable names, making analysis harder, and dynamically loads dependencies via pip.\n\n**Potential Harm:**\n- Complete compromise of all browser-stored credentials, cookies, and session tokens (including for banking, email, social media, and cryptocurrency wallets).\n- Theft of cryptocurrency via clipboard hijacking.\n- Account takeover for Discord, Roblox, Minecraft, Steam, and more.\n- Loss of privacy due to exfiltration of system info, screenshots, and geolocation.\n- Potential for further malware installation or lateral movement.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThis is a full-featured infostealer and crypto stealer, designed to maximize data theft and evade detection. It is extremely dangerous and should be treated as a severe security threat.",
