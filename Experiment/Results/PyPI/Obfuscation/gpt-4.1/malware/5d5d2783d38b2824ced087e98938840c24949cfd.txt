      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic remote code execution and malware delivery technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, hidden window, and encoded command is a common method to evade detection. The code also tries to hide its activity by catching all exceptions and not reporting errors. The rest of the code is a decoy (a fake setup() call). This code is highly dangerous as it can compromise the system by downloading and running arbitrary executables from the internet.",
