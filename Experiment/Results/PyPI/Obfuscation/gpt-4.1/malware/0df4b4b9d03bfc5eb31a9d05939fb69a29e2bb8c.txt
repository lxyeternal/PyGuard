      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which is commonly used to infect a system with further malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, misleading variable names, and hiding the PowerShell window) is intended to evade detection. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks in Python packages. The second part of the code is a standard setup() call and is not malicious, but the first part clearly demonstrates malicious intent and behavior.",
