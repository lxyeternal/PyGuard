      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. It attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package if not present, which is often used for Windows automation and COM object manipulation. More notably, it creates a directory within the user's AppData folder and writes a 'background.js' JavaScript file containing obfuscated code that appears to interact with Chrome's extension system, potentially to inject or run malicious scripts. Additionally, it creates a 'manifest.json' to load this extension with permissions for clipboard access. The script then searches for shortcut (.lnk) files in common user directories and modifies certain shortcuts pointing to popular browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave) to include a command-line argument that loads the malicious extension. This behavior suggests the code is designed to surreptitiously install a malicious browser extension, potentially to monitor, steal data, or perform other malicious activities, making it highly malicious.",
