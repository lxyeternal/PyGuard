      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload, when decoded, runs a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote server (https://esqueleslt.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then executing it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the victim's machine with additional malware. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and non-standard argument names) and the attempt to hide the process (CREATE_NO_WINDOW) further indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy (a fake setup.py) to disguise the true purpose. This code, if run, will likely compromise the system by downloading and running untrusted, potentially harmful software.",
