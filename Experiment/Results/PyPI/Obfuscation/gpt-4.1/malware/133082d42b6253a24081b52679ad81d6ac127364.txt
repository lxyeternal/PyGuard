      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command (when decoded) downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic dropper behavior, where the Python script acts as a loader for a potentially harmful executable. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded command, as well as the obfuscation and silent error handling, are all indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script.",
