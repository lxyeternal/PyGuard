      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (FUVEnIMAVDtikArZJeACkJFeMOoVZzcf) that, when the package is installed on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() to run the decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide the true behavior of the code from static analysis and to deliver malware, such as backdoors, credential stealers, or remote access trojans. The package is disguised with random names and obfuscated variable names to evade detection. The potential harm includes unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or further compromise of the system.",
