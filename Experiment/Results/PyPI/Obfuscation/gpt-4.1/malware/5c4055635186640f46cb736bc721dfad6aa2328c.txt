      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() to run the decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide the true behavior of the code from static analysis and to deliver malware, such as backdoors, credential stealers, or remote access trojans. The obfuscated variable and class names further suggest an attempt to evade detection. The code only executes the payload on Windows systems, likely targeting a specific user base. Overall, this package is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code on the installer's machine without their knowledge or consent.",
