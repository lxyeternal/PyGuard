      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and complex constructs that suggest malicious intent. It dynamically imports modules, executes code from encoded strings, and performs calculations with seemingly arbitrary or intentionally confusing logic. The presence of functions that generate and execute code snippets, combined with obfuscated variable names and string encodings, indicates an attempt to hide malicious payloads or behaviors. Additionally, the code appears to perform indirect function calls and dynamic code execution, which are common techniques used in malware to evade detection and execute harmful actions such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or payload delivery. Overall, the code is designed to conceal its true purpose and likely aims to perform malicious activities.",
