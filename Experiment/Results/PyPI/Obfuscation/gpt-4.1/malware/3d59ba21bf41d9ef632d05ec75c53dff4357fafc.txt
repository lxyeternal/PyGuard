      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the package installation process, executes a base64-encoded shell command which, when decoded and run, establishes a reverse shell connection to an external server ('e6j4342057.zicp.fun') on port 26264. This allows an attacker to gain remote control over the compromised system, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The use of obfuscated code, base64 encoding, and network connections during installation are common indicators of malicious intent.",
