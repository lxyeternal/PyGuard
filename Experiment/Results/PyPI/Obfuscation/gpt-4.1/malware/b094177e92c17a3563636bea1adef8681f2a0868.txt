      "malicious_behavior": "This code downloads a Windows executable file ('doenerium-win.1.exe') from a remote GitHub repository and saves it to a subdirectory of the user's APPDATA folder under the name 'kekwltd.exe'. It then executes the downloaded file using the Windows 'start' command. This behavior is characteristic of a dropper or downloader, which is a common technique used by malware to fetch and execute additional malicious payloads on a victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names and the placement of the executable in a system directory further indicate an attempt to evade detection. Running arbitrary executables from the internet without user consent is highly dangerous and can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
