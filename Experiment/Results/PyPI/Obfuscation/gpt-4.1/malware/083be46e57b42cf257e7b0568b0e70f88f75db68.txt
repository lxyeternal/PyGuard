Additionally, it sends system-specific information (the 'COMPUTERNAME' environment variable) to a remote server ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation <COMPUTERNAME>'). This behavior indicates an attempt to perform remote reconnaissance, deliver malware, or establish a backdoor, which is characteristic of malicious activity.",
