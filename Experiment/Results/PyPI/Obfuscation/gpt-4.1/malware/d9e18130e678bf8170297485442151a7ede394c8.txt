      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decrypts and executes hidden code at runtime. It uses base64, base32, zlib compression, marshal deserialization, and cryptography (Fernet) to decode, decrypt, and execute malicious code dynamically. This pattern is characteristic of malware or backdoors designed to hide their true intent, evade detection, and run arbitrary code on the host system. The presence of such complex, layered decoding and execution strongly indicates malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden, potentially harmful payloads.",
