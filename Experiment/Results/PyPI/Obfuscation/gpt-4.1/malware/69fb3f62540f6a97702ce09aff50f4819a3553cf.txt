      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious activities indicative of malicious intent. It attempts to access cloud metadata (e.g., AWS IAM credentials) by querying the instance metadata service, which can be used to extract sensitive cloud environment information. It also gathers system details such as hostname, username, current working directory, and IP address, potentially for fingerprinting purposes. The script then checks for the presence of environment files (.env) and, if found, uploads their contents to external servers via HTTP POST requests, which could be exfiltration of sensitive data. Additionally, it encodes the username in base64 and hex, then performs a DNS query with this encoded string, possibly for covert communication or data exfiltration. The repeated use of external endpoints and data collection without clear legitimate purpose strongly suggests malicious behavior aimed at reconnaissance, data theft, or command and control activities.",
