      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity, including: \n\n1. Data Exfiltration: It collects sensitive user data such as browser cookies, saved passwords, and other credentials from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) and Discord-related data. It then compresses and uploads this data to remote servers or transfer services.\n\n2. Token Theft and Validation: It scans files and memory for tokens (e.g., Discord tokens, API keys), verifies their validity, and uploads them, facilitating account hijacking.\n\n3. Credential Harvesting: It searches for stored passwords, cookies, and other sensitive information from local databases and browser storage, potentially leading to credential theft.\n\n4. Remote Command and Control: It communicates with remote servers via webhooks and HTTP requests, possibly allowing command execution or further data exfiltration.\n\n5. Persistence and Stealth: It attempts to hide its activities by encrypting/decrypting data, obfuscating code, and using threading to perform concurrent operations without user awareness.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to steal user credentials, cookies, tokens, and other sensitive data, then exfiltrate this information to attacker-controlled endpoints, which classifies it as malicious malware (a stealer or info-stealer).",
