      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of indirection, dynamic evaluation (eval), and encoded payloads to hide its true purpose. The code constructs Python built-in functions and module names at runtime, decodes large base64 and hex blobs, and ultimately executes the decoded payload using eval or exec. The use of eval, exec, dynamic imports, and encoded payloads is a hallmark of malicious code, as it is designed to evade detection and analysis. The final payload is likely to be a second-stage malicious script, which could perform a variety of harmful actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise. The obfuscation and dynamic execution make it difficult to determine the exact behavior without full deobfuscation, but the structure and techniques used are consistent with malware droppers or loaders. This code should be considered highly dangerous and should not be executed in any environment.",
