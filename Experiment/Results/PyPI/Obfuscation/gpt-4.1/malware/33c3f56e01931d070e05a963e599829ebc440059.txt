      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it dynamically using `exec()`. The decoded payload is highly obfuscated, containing numerous string manipulations, base64 decodings, and nested function calls, which strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Such behavior is characteristic of malware or malicious scripts designed to evade detection and execute harmful actions, such as downloading, installing, or executing malicious payloads, or establishing unauthorized access. The obfuscation and use of `exec()` on decoded data are classic indicators of malicious activity, making this code malicious.",
