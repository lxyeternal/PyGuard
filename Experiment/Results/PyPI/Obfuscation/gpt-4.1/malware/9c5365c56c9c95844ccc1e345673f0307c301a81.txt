      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `CXmfIjFXLxZgprgNQWNRsREnuoDlUhhJ()` that is registered to run at program exit via `atexit`. This function performs several suspicious actions: it writes a line 'proof bug by kotko' to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt', then collects the system's public IP address, hostname, and current directory path, encodes this information in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain ('https://kotko.org') with the encoded data appended as a query parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system information to an external server, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as spying, unauthorized data collection, or command-and-control communication. Additionally, the code's obfuscated variable names and the use of a 'proof bug' message suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
