It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a remote server (webhook.site), which is commonly used for exfiltrating data. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This behavior constitutes an information-stealing backdoor, and can be used for reconnaissance or further targeted attacks against the victim.",
