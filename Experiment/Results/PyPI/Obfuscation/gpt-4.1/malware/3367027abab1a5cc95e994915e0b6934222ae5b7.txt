      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded payload that, when executed, appears to perform network requests to a remote server (http://20.226.18.203/grab/ry2K1CVRSFa59vT), potentially for command and control or data exfiltration. It also includes obfuscated code that may execute further malicious actions, such as executing system commands or downloading additional payloads. The use of base64 decoding, dynamic code execution via `exec`, and network communication strongly suggest malicious intent, likely to compromise the host system or exfiltrate data.",
