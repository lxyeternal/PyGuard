      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a segment that writes the contents of 'QuickWebBasicAuth/tmp.py' directly into the source file of the 'socket' module, which is a core Python standard library module. Specifically, it opens the source file of the socket module in append-binary mode and appends the contents of 'QuickWebBasicAuth/tmp.py' to it. This behavior is highly suspicious and potentially malicious because it modifies a standard library module at runtime, which can lead to persistent backdoors, tampering with system-level functionality, or executing arbitrary code with elevated privileges. Such modifications can compromise system security, hide malicious activities, or cause unpredictable behavior in other Python programs that rely on the socket module.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious intent. It creates a persistent background process that maintains an open socket connection to a remote server ('43.228.69.226' on port 8889), likely for command and control (C2) communication. It attempts to establish an SSL-encrypted connection, receives data, decodes and decompresses it, and executes the payload dynamically via `exec`. Additionally, it manipulates temporary files and employs threading to maintain persistence or hide activity. These behaviors—remote command execution, persistent network communication, dynamic code execution, and obfuscation—are characteristic of malware or backdoor trojans designed to control or compromise the host system.",
