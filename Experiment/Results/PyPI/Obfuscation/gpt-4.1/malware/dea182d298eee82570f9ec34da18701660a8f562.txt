This behavior is typical of malicious scripts aiming to collect sensitive information (such as environment variables that may contain secrets, tokens, or system details) and transmit it to an attacker-controlled server. The obfuscated function and class names, along with the code's structure, further suggest an intent to hide malicious activity. Additionally, the code executes this exfiltration during package setup and installation phases, which could be used to surreptitiously gather data during package installation or development.",
