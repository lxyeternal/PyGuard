This technique is commonly used to hide malicious intent, such as downloading or executing malware, exfiltrating data, or establishing backdoors. The presence of such obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggests malicious behavior, especially since the decoded payload is not directly visible in the source code, making analysis difficult and indicating intent to conceal malicious operations.",
