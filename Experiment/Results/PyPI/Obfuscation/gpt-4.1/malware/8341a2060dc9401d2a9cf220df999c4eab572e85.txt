      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (WNLzJrDqlPMYTespKmIPOmrkXIHQihMR) that, when the package is installed on a Windows system, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute a block of encrypted Python code. The decryption key and ciphertext are hardcoded. This technique is commonly used to hide the true intent of the payload, making static analysis difficult and evading detection. The decrypted code is executed with exec(), which can perform any arbitrary action, such as data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or other malicious activities. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malware. The code is specifically designed to target Windows systems, as it checks for os.name == 'nt'.",
