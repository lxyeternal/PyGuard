      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated function that decodes and executes a base64-encoded string, which imports the 'requests' module and performs a network request with potentially sensitive credentials ('ak' and 'secret') embedded in the code. This behavior suggests an attempt to silently perform unauthorized network operations, possibly exfiltrate data, or establish connections to malicious endpoints. Additionally, the code's structure, including dynamic endpoint resolution, custom request signing, and retry logic, indicates it may be part of a malicious SDK or backdoor designed to communicate with external servers covertly. The presence of obfuscated code and the use of base64 decoding for executing code are classic indicators of malicious intent.",
