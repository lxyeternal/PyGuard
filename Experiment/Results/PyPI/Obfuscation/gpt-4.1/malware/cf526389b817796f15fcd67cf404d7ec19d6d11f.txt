      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. The key indicator is the use of a highly obfuscated exec() statement at the top of the file. The code constructs a string by joining the results of map(chr, [...]), where the list is generated by extracting numbers from a series of obfuscated string manipulations. This is a classic technique to hide the real payload, which is then executed at runtime. The use of exec() to run dynamically generated code is a red flag for malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The rest of the file is a decoy setup() call, making the file appear as a normal Python package setup script. The actual payload is hidden in the obfuscated exec() call, which could perform any number of harmful actions, such as data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or other attacks. This type of obfuscation is commonly used in supply chain attacks via PyPI or similar repositories. The code is designed to evade static analysis and to execute its payload when the package is installed or otherwise run.",
