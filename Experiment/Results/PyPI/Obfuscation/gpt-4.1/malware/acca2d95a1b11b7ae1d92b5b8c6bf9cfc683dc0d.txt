      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from an external source, as indicated by the presence of the encoded PowerShell command and the check for the existence of a specific file ('tahg'). If the file does not exist, it triggers the PowerShell command, potentially to download or run malicious code silently in the background. Additionally, the code suppresses errors silently with broad try-except blocks, which can hide failures or malicious activity. Overall, this pattern strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution or malware download, making the code malicious.",
