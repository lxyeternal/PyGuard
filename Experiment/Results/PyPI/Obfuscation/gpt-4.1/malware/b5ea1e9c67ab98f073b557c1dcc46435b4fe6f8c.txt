      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and heavily convoluted constructs that suggest malicious intent. It dynamically imports modules, executes code via `exec`, and manipulates functions and properties in a way that appears designed to hide its true purpose. The presence of functions that perform dynamic code execution, combined with obfuscated string literals and complex control flow, indicates an attempt to conceal malicious behavior such as executing arbitrary code, exfiltrating data, or establishing backdoors. Additionally, the code references external URLs (e.g., GitHub and Discord links), which could be used for command and control or data exfiltration. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malware or malicious scripts.",
