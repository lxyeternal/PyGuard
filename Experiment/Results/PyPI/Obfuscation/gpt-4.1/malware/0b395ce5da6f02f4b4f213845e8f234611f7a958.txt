      "malicious_behavior": "This setup.py script is suspicious and likely malicious for several reasons: (1) The package_data field includes '*.exe' files within the 'hlokty' package, which is highly unusual for a Python package, as .exe files are Windows executables and can be used to deliver malware. (2) The package name 'svq54dtw1b48dzpw' and script name 'hlokty' are both random-looking and do not correspond to any known legitimate packages, which is a common tactic for typosquatting or hiding malicious intent. (3) The script sets up a console entry point, which could be used to execute arbitrary code when the package is installed and run. (4) The use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'eEDLpijCUnJwNJVektzVTeFQtCFPRaqZ', 'APyQJJpqJlplWwOFphRMWMvsPWQcjwAN') is a common technique to hinder code analysis. While the code itself does not directly execute malicious actions, it is designed to distribute and potentially execute Windows executables, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Installing this package could result in the execution of malicious binaries on the user's system.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. The most critical is the function TFneAJaRvKhOLNZcjJgEHSssyhdcwpDm, which attempts to execute the command 'del C:\\Windows\\System32\\*.*'. This command, if run with sufficient privileges, would attempt to delete all files in the Windows System32 directory, which would render the operating system inoperable and is a classic form of destructive malware. The code also includes a function (EJcXRMCIuMMCivpCafuyZMRQUGjWKZap) that executes an external binary ('kitty.exe') from the package's assets, which could be any arbitrary or malicious executable. The code is designed to trigger these behaviors based on command-line arguments, specifically '--kill-system' for the destructive action and '--silent' for running the external executable without user interaction. Additionally, the code attempts to open a YouTube link, which is benign but may serve as a distraction or decoy. Overall, this code is highly dangerous and should be considered malicious.",
