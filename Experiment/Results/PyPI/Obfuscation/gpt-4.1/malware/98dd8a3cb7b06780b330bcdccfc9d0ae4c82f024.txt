      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (WGtONQepjDYfBRgMuHsDGioawGfDcJqe) that, during the installation process, downloads a remote Python script ('ratfinal.py') from a Discord CDN URL and executes it using the local Python interpreter. The downloaded script is not part of the package and its contents are unknown, but the filename ('ratfinal.py') and the use of a Discord CDN strongly suggest it is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) or other form of malware. This behavior allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, which can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation. The code also uses obfuscated class and variable names to evade detection. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package.",
