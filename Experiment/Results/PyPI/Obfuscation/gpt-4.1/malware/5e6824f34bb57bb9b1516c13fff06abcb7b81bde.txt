      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits typical characteristics of obfuscated malicious scripts. It begins by installing a wide array of potentially unnecessary or suspicious Python packages, which could be used to facilitate malicious activities such as network communication, clipboard manipulation, cryptography, or system access. The core of the code involves decompressing and executing a large, compressed payload via `marshal.loads(gzip.decompress(...))`, which is a common technique to hide malicious payloads and evade static detection. The use of multiple compression and encoding libraries, along with dynamic execution, indicates intent to conceal malicious logic. Overall, this code is designed to run hidden, potentially harmful operations, such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or remote command execution, making it malicious.",
