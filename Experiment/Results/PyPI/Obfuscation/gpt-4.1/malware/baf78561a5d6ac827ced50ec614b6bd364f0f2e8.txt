      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated eval and base64 decoding functions that execute dynamically decoded code, which is a common technique used to hide malicious payloads. Specifically, the line `eval(compile(base64.b64decode(eval('ourour')),'<string>','exec'))` decodes and executes code from a base64 string, which can be malicious. Additionally, the code constructs and executes code via `eval` with obfuscated string literals, making it difficult to analyze statically. This behavior suggests the script is designed to run hidden or malicious code, potentially leading to remote code execution, data theft, or other harmful actions. The presence of such obfuscation and dynamic execution indicates malicious intent.",
