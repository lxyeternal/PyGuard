      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by collecting sensitive information from the host system, such as environment variables and SSH private keys, encoding this data in base64, and exfiltrating it via HTTP requests to an external command-and-control server. Specifically, it searches for '.env' files and SSH private keys, reads their contents, encodes them, and sends them to a remote URL. Additionally, it attempts to read the user's SSH private key ('id_rsa') and exfiltrate it. The code is embedded within setup scripts, which can be used to execute malicious actions during installation or development, making it a clear example of a backdoor or data theft malware.",
