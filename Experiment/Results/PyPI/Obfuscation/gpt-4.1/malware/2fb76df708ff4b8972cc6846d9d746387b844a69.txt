      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150599404/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which can be used to deliver further malware to the victim's machine. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded command, as well as the attempt to evade detection by only running if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, are clear indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script.",
