It then dynamically compiles and executes this payload via eval, which is a common technique to hide malicious actions such as downloading, executing, or manipulating files, or establishing unauthorized connections. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious intent, as it aims to conceal its true behavior and evade static analysis.",
