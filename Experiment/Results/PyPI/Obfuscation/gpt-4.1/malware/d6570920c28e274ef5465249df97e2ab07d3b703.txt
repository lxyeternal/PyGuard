      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command upon installation or execution. Specifically, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command using an encoded command string. The encoded command (Base64) decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150599404/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a dropper or downloader, which is a common malware technique to fetch and execute additional malicious payloads from the internet. The use of hidden windows and obfuscation (encoded PowerShell) further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
