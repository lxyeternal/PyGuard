      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that decodes and executes a base64-encoded string, which likely contains malicious code. This payload is hidden within a try-except block inside a custom installation class, making it difficult to detect through static analysis. The embedded base64 string, once decoded, appears to import system modules, perform network requests, or execute arbitrary code, indicating malicious intent such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and hidden payloads strongly suggests malicious behavior designed to evade detection and compromise the host system.",
