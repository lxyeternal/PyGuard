It attempts to access the Google Cloud metadata service at http://169.254.169.254/computeMetadata/v1/instance/service-accounts/default/token to retrieve the instance's service account access token. If successful, it exfiltrates this sensitive token by sending it via an HTTP POST request to an external server (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log). This behavior is characteristic of credential theft and exfiltration attacks, which can allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to cloud resources, escalate privileges, or perform further attacks using the stolen token. The use of obfuscated variable names and the targeting of cloud metadata endpoints further indicate malicious intent.",
