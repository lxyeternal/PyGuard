      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function that, when executed, performs the following malicious actions: it downloads content from a suspicious URL, establishes a reverse shell connection to an external IP address and port, redirects the current process's input/output streams to this connection, and spawns an interactive shell. This behavior effectively allows an attacker to gain remote control over the compromised system, making it a clear backdoor or remote access trojan (RAT). The code is designed to execute arbitrary commands received over the network, which poses significant security risks.",
