      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command encoded in Base64, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The encoded command likely downloads or executes malicious content from a remote server, as indicated by the URL in the decoded command. Additionally, the script runs this command with hidden window flags, minimizing user awareness. The presence of such obfuscated remote code execution strongly suggests malicious intent, potentially for malware download, remote control, or data exfiltration.",
