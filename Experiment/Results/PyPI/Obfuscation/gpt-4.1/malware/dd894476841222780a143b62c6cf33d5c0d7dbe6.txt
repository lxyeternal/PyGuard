      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a setup script that installs several potentially malicious or privacy-invasive Python packages such as 'browser_cookie3', 'discordwebhook', and 'robloxpy'. These packages can be used to extract browser cookies, send data to Discord webhooks, and interact with Roblox accounts, respectively. The combination of these packages suggests an intent to collect user data, exfiltrate information via webhooks, or perform unauthorized actions on user accounts. The use of obfuscated variable names further indicates malicious intent, aiming to hide the true purpose of the code.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to extract and exfiltrate a user's Roblox security cookie (.ROBLOSECURITY) from various browser cookie stores (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera). It then verifies the cookie's validity via Roblox API, retrieves user information, and constructs a detailed message containing sensitive data such as the cookie, user ID, username, Robux balance, account age, creation date, premium status, and IP address. This message is then sent to a specified Discord webhook URL. The behavior indicates an intent to hijack user accounts, steal personal and account data, and send it to an attacker-controlled server, which is malicious activity.",
