      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic example of a downloader or dropper, which is used to fetch and execute additional malware on the victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' and 'subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW' ensures the process is hidden from the user, making the attack stealthy. The code also uses exception handling to suppress errors, further hiding its activity. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script. This code is highly dangerous and should not be executed.",
