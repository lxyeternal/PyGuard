      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains hidden malicious behavior that executes an encrypted payload only on Windows systems. It decrypts and runs code via Fernet encryption, which is a common obfuscation technique to hide malicious scripts. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data indicates execution of potentially harmful code, such as malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines. Additionally, the code's obfuscated variable names and conditional execution suggest an intent to conceal malicious activity from casual inspection.",
