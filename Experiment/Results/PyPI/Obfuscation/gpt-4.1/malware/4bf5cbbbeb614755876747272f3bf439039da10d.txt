      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload, when decoded, runs a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150599404/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory and then executing it. This is a classic remote code execution and malware delivery technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' ensures the process is hidden from the user, making detection harder. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors, and the malicious behavior is disguised within what appears to be a normal Python package setup script. This is a clear attempt to infect the user's system with a potentially harmful executable, which could lead to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation.",
