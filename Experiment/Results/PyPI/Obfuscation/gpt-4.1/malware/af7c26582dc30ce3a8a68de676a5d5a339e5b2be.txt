It includes functions that exfiltrate system information, browser passwords, cookies, and Discord tokens, and then send this data to a remote webhook. It also contains code for establishing reverse shells and potentially starting local tunnels, which are common in remote access Trojans (RATs). The code obfuscates its behavior with excessive string manipulations and dynamic execution, further suggesting malicious intent. Overall, this script is designed to stealthily gather sensitive user data, maintain remote access, and exfiltrate information, which classifies it as malicious.",
