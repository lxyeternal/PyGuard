      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `HCBWuhnGtoOLvxjOeseQsNmpnHxPUdgy()` that is registered to run at program exit. This function performs several suspicious actions: it writes a string 'proof bug by kotko' to a file named 'pocbykotko.txt', retrieves the public IP address of the machine via an external API ('https://api.ipify.org'), gathers system information, encodes this data in base64, and then sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain ('https://kotko.org') with the encoded data as a query parameter. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of system and network information without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious activity such as spying, data theft, or unauthorized surveillance.",
