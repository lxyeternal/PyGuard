      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing arbitrary files from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/), which is a known indicator of malicious activity. It fetches a list of filenames from an external URL, filters them based on the current platform, then downloads and executes these files without any validation or user consent. The code also attempts to set executable permissions and run the downloaded files in the background, which can be used to deploy malware, backdoors, or other malicious payloads. Additionally, the obfuscated function names and the repeated invocation of a custom request function suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent and evade detection.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'frequest' and references functions and variables with obfuscated or nonsensical names, such as 'XRQdXLkdDDfvJwaaLzjatafGKgeuWgJv', 'BRKGhSUOFBuCwuMHuZfvOZNHNNlMkYnx', 'DjvoTJNmKYBKxWDqWCjMtZpXlvaHxGsU', and 'delete'. The use of such obfuscated identifiers suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The presence of a 'delete' function imported from an obscure module could indicate malicious behavior such as data destruction, unauthorized data exfiltration, or system compromise. Without additional context or code, this pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions.",
