      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated functions that decode base64-encoded strings and execute system commands, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to hide malicious URLs or commands. Specifically, the function `BrRWMvbgGbmIkBXJdrKqYfsvGkSmgWPJ()` decodes a base64 string that, when decoded, forms a command to perform a `curl` request to an external URL (`https://a9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app`). This URL likely points to a malicious server or payload. The code then hooks into the `develop` and `install` commands of `setuptools`, executing this malicious command during package installation or development setup. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently contact a remote server, potentially to download or execute malicious payloads, making the code malicious.",
