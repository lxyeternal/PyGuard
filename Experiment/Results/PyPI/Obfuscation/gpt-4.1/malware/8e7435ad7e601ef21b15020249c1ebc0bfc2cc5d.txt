      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered during package installation, collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is a common technique for exfiltrating data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of obfuscated class and method names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This behavior constitutes an information-stealing backdoor, and its presence in a Python package could lead to serious privacy and security breaches for users who install the package.",
