      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious activity. It gathers system information such as hostname, username, and current directory, then encodes this data in base64, further obfuscates it through custom encoding, and sends it to external servers via HTTP requests using various methods (urllib, requests, os.system ping). Additionally, it constructs and sends encoded commands or data to remote servers, likely for command-and-control or data exfiltration purposes. The use of obfuscation, data collection, and network communication to external domains strongly suggests malicious intent, such as establishing a backdoor, exfiltrating sensitive information, or executing remote commands.",
