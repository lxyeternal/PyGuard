Specifically, it retrieves the machine's hostname and sends it to a remote server ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation <hostname>'). Additionally, on Windows systems, it downloads an executable from 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', saves it locally as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and then executes it. This behavior indicates an attempt to silently install malicious software or backdoors, which can compromise the target system's security and privacy.",
