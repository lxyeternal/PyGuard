This behavior indicates an attempt to install and execute a potentially malicious payload silently, which could be used for remote code execution, persistence, or other malicious activities.

Additionally, it appends a command to '~/.bashrc' to run this file on shell startup. This behavior indicates an attempt to persistently install and run potentially malicious code without user consent, which is characteristic of malware or backdoor activity.
