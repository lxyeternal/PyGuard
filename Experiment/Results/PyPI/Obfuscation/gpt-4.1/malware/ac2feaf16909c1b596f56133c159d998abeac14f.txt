      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that exfiltrate user information from Discord accounts and send it to an external server. Specifically, the function `GQnZWaPfwUmQMMYlEubaNjXwMcPxIIPD` retrieves user data, including username, email, phone, and relationships, and then sends this data via a POST request to a remote URL. Additionally, the code appears to be designed to gather sensitive user information without consent, which is malicious behavior. The presence of obfuscated base64-encoded URLs and the collection of personal data indicate intent to compromise user privacy and security.",
