      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun), which is a domain commonly used for exfiltration and testing by attackers (OAST - Open Redirect and SSRF Testing). This behavior constitutes an information-stealing backdoor, as it leaks potentially identifying and sensitive data without user consent during the installation process. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
