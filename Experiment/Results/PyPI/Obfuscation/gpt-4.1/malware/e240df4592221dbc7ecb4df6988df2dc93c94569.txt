      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a highly obfuscated malware designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data. It performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. **Data Extraction and Stealing:**\n   - Extracts stored browser credentials (cookies, passwords, login data) from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, etc.) by decrypting stored encrypted keys and credentials.\n   - Accesses and copies sensitive files such as browser login data, cookies, and possibly other user data.\n   - Retrieves stored credentials from applications like Steam, Riot, Discord, and other gaming or financial apps.\n   - Collects system information such as IP address, MAC address, hardware IDs, and other identifiers.\n\n2. **Data Exfiltration:**\n   - Sends the collected data to a remote Discord webhook, formatted with embedded messages containing user info, credentials, and system details.\n   - Uploads files (like cookies, passwords, or other data) to external servers via file hosting services (e.g., gofile.io).\n\n3. **Persistence and Evasion:**\n   - Checks for specific processes, hardware IDs, or system configurations to avoid detection or to target specific systems.\n   - Uses extensive obfuscation with base64, zlib compression, and dynamic code execution to hide malicious intent.\n   - Attempts to install or run modules like 'requests' and 'pycryptodome' if missing.\n\n4. **Additional Capabilities:**\n   - Can kill certain processes (e.g., browsers, Steam) to prevent interference.\n   - Archives and deletes traces of its activity.\n   - Collects and reports system and user data in a structured format.\n\n**Overall:**\nThis code is a malicious information stealer targeting browsers, gaming platforms, and system info, exfiltrating data to a Discord webhook, which could be used for malicious purposes such as identity theft, account hijacking, or further malware deployment. It is unequivocally malicious.",
