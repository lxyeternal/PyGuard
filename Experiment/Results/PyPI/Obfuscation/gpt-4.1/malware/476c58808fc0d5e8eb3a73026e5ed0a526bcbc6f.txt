      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload. The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, data stealers, or downloaders, on the victim's machine. The code only triggers on Windows systems, further suggesting targeted malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable and class names, as well as the use of encrypted payloads, are typical of attempts to evade detection and analysis.",
