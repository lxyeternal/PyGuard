      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which can be used to deliver further malware to the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup metadata) is intended to evade detection. The code is triggered only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, likely as a simple persistence or anti-redundancy check. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup. This behavior is highly dangerous as it can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or further compromise of the system.",
