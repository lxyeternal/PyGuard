      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation class that, during installation, collects sensitive system information such as hostname, current working directory, username, and directory listings of critical system paths (/ , /root/, /home/, /root/.ssh/). It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to an external server (https://j0j0.xyz/lists/<hostname>/<current_directory>/). Additionally, it attempts to create a file at /root/j0j0.poc, which may require root privileges. This behavior indicates data exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information without user consent, characteristic of malicious activity such as spyware, backdoor, or information-stealing malware.",
