It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external domain ('https://cas54n1gfihn6082nil0kz451ubndy6rt.dooracle.in'), which could be used for malicious purposes such as tracking, fingerprinting, or exfiltration of user environment details without user consent. This behavior indicates malicious intent, as it collects and transmits user/system data covertly during package installation.",
