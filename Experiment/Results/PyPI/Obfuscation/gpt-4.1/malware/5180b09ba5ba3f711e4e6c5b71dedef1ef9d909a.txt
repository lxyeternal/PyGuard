      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on a Windows system (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. The use of exec() on decrypted code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. This technique is commonly used to hide and execute malware, such as backdoors, data stealers, or remote access tools, without the user's knowledge. The obfuscated variable and class names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The code only triggers on Windows, which is a common target for malware. The actual payload is not visible without decryption, but the structure and behavior are consistent with Python malware delivery via package installation.",
