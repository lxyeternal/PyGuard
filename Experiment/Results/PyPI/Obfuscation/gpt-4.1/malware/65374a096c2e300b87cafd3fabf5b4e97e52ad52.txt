      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic remote code execution and malware delivery technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common method to evade detection and run commands without user visibility. The code also checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' as a marker to avoid repeated execution. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This behavior can result in the compromise of the user's system, data theft, or further malware infection.",
