      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to fetch and execute additional malware on the victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' and 'subprocess.Popen' is intended to hide the execution from the user. The code also checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' as a simple persistence or execution guard. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code is highly dangerous and should be considered malware.",
