      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and suspicious behavior indicative of malicious intent. Specifically, it conditionally executes a decryption of a payload using Fernet encryption when running on Windows ('nt' OS). The decrypted payload is then executed via `exec()`, which is a common technique used to run malicious code dynamically. The presence of encrypted data, the use of `exec()`, and the conditional execution only on Windows suggest an attempt to hide malicious payloads and evade detection. Additionally, the code imports potentially unnecessary modules and uses obfuscated variable names, further indicating malicious obfuscation. Overall, this code appears designed to deliver and execute malicious payloads covertly on Windows systems.",
