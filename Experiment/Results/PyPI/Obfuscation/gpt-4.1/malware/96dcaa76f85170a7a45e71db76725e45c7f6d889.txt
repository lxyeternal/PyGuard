      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It is a supply chain attack targeting macOS ('darwin') systems during the installation process of a Python package. The code is heavily obfuscated, but its behavior is as follows: \n\n1. During installation (via a custom setuptools install command), it runs the command 'ioreg -k IOPlatformUUID' to extract the system's unique hardware identifier (IOPlatformUUID).\n2. It uses a regular expression to extract the UUID from the command output, hashes it with SHA-256, and checks if the hash is in a hardcoded allowlist.\n3. If the hash matches, it attempts to read two files from the user's '~/.config/gcloud/' directory: 'application_default_credentials.json' and 'credentials.db'. These files typically contain Google Cloud authentication credentials and tokens.\n4. The contents of these files are then exfiltrated via an HTTPS POST request to a remote server ('europe-west2-workload-422915.cloudfunctions.net'), with the hash as a header for correlation.\n5. The code is obfuscated with random function and variable names, base64-encoded strings, and indirect imports to evade detection.\n\nThis behavior constitutes credential theft and unauthorized exfiltration of sensitive data, which is highly malicious and can lead to account compromise, privilege escalation, and further attacks on cloud infrastructure.",
