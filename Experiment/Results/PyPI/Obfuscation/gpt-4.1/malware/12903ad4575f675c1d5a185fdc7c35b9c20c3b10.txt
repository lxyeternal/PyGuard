      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (jXFjTROVfRohzCBJrRoOIgzaqFtzuAiq) that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes a block of encrypted Python code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The decryption key is hardcoded, and the encrypted payload is present in the code. This technique is commonly used to hide the true intent of the payload from static analysis and to evade detection. The payload is executed with full privileges during package installation, which could allow for arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or other harmful actions. The use of obfuscated variable names and encrypted payloads is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
