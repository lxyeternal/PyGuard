      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory and then running it. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing malware on a victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' ensures the operation is not visible to the user, and the code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code is designed to compromise the system by downloading and running potentially harmful software.",
