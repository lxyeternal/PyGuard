      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It creates a temporary Python file containing code that downloads and executes additional Python code from a remote URL (https://rentry.co/ki74h/raw) using urllib. The temporary file is then executed using the Pythonw interpreter (which runs without a console window on Windows), making the execution stealthier. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper, which is commonly used to fetch and execute further malicious payloads from the internet. The use of obfuscated variable names and indirect imports further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code can potentially allow remote code execution, data theft, or further compromise of the system.",
