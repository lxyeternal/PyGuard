      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits malicious behavior by downloading and executing arbitrary files from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/), which is a common tactic used in malware distribution. It fetches a list of filenames based on the current operating system, then downloads each file, saves it locally, sets executable permissions on Linux/macOS, and runs the files in the background. Additionally, the code redefines standard HTTP methods (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options) to invoke the malicious download and execution routine before performing the actual request, effectively hijacking legitimate network operations to silently execute malicious payloads. This pattern indicates an intent to covertly infect or control the host machine, making the code malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'frequest' and references functions or variables with obfuscated or nonsensical names such as 'JGRLVNeaCQmskyOsNMgPNUNDjTMzUdjH', 'gwfyJeWJJsrQHSStgPPPFkIGUXHSqOFt', 'JvmQVSGllQLRXzwXVGxHjZPcySrIGjLP', and 'delete'. The presence of such obfuscated identifiers suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The 'delete' function, in particular, could be used to delete files, data, or system components, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts. The overall pattern indicates that this code is likely designed to perform harmful actions, such as data destruction, unauthorized access, or system compromise, especially given the suspicious import and obfuscated naming conventions.",
