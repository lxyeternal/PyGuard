      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function `BvHbqCehVyQQteHfylTdxAXfzOKNoniy()` that executes upon program exit, which performs the following malicious actions:\n- Retrieves the current machine's public IP address via an external API (`https://api.ipify.org`).\n- Gathers system hostname information.\n- Encodes the IP, hostname, and script path into a base64 string.\n- Sends this encoded data as a GET request to an external domain (`https://kotko.org`) with a specific query parameter.\n\nThis behavior indicates data exfiltration of system information to an attacker-controlled server, which is a clear malicious activity. The code also writes to a file named 'kotko.txt', which could be used for further malicious purposes or as a marker. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily collect and transmit system information without user consent, confirming malicious intent.",
