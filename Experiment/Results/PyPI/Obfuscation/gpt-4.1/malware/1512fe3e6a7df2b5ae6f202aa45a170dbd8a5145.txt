      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It disguises itself as a standard setup.py script for a Python package, but it uses obfuscated and non-standard keyword arguments in the setuptools.setup() function (e.g., 'OvWNyZRWFMBSsgwusDyOePDrddDbCgxm', 'mnodgEaYgzCEYPHIGjslEpegFyJGCDFP', 'CjdxtARmXpEEcNjCWhPlKaHpwqToXCBB', 'MnWNqWqlesAhyadCUhKmHSUiHAWaXNna') instead of the expected ones ('version', 'long_description', 'project_urls', 'packages'). This will cause setuptools to ignore these fields, and the actual required metadata will be missing. This is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious packages to hide the real intent or to bypass automated analysis tools. While this specific code does not directly execute any harmful payload, the obfuscation and deviation from standard practice are strong indicators of an attempt to hide malicious behavior or to serve as a decoy for further malicious actions. Such code could be used to trick users or automated systems into installing a package that later downloads or executes malicious code.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the system's uname (which reveals OS and host information), the user's home directory, and the current working directory. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it as a query parameter to a remote server (https://pypi.org/reqs), but with a suspicious Host header (psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net), which is likely an attempt to exfiltrate data to an attacker-controlled endpoint using domain fronting. The use of obfuscated variable names and a wrapper function to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This behavior constitutes information stealing and unauthorized data exfiltration, which is clearly malicious.",
