      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'src_file' and then calls a function 'BLjYHfiqHHwywpomDxBxBcUZfnZbGadr()' which is presumably defined in that module. The function name is highly obfuscated, which is a common tactic used to hide malicious intent. Without the actual content of 'src_file', it is impossible to determine the exact behavior, but the use of a wildcard import and the invocation of an obfuscated function strongly suggest an attempt to execute hidden or potentially harmful code. This pattern is typical in malicious scripts that try to evade detection by hiding their true functionality in external files and using non-descriptive names. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. Its primary purpose is to steal sensitive data from the user's computer, specifically targeting the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet. The code attempts to locate and collect various Exodus wallet files (such as configuration, wallet info, passphrase, seed, storage, and two-factor authentication files) from the user's AppData directory. It also tries to collect files named 'exodus.txt' from the Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders. All these files are compressed into a ZIP archive. The code then collects the user's public IP address and country code, formats a message, and sends both the message and the ZIP archive to a hardcoded Telegram chat using the Telegram Bot API. After exfiltration, it attempts to delete the ZIP file to cover its tracks. This behavior constitutes credential and wallet theft, exfiltration of private data, and unauthorized remote communication, all of which are hallmarks of malware.",
