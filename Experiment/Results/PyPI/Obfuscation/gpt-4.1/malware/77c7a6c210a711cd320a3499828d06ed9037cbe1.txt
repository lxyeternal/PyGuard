      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes, primarily to steal and exfiltrate Roblox account cookies (specifically the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie) from the user's browser. It accesses cookies across multiple browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera) for the domain 'roblox.com', retrieves the cookie value, and then verifies its validity using Roblox's API. If valid, it gathers user information such as UserID, username, Robux balance, account age, and other profile details via Roblox's API and the 'robloxpy' library. It then constructs a detailed message containing this information, including the stolen cookie, and sends it to a specified Discord webhook URL. This behavior indicates an intent to hijack user accounts, perform unauthorized data collection, and exfiltrate sensitive information without user consent, which is malicious.",
