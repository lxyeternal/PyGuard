      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds a hidden, covert communication mechanism that activates during the installation, development, or egg_info commands. It generates and sends DNS queries to a specific domain ('for-research.ru') with encoded data containing system information such as hostname, user, current directory, and custom identifiers. This behavior resembles data exfiltration or command-and-control (C2) communication, which is characteristic of malicious malware or backdoors. The obfuscated function names, use of secrets for DNS packet construction, and the timing of network activity during setup phases strongly suggest malicious intent to secretly gather and transmit system data without user consent.",
