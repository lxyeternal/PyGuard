      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious intent, including: \n\n1. **Data Exfiltration and Credential Theft:**\n   - It accesses browser data (Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, Yandex, etc.) and extracts stored login credentials and cookies, decrypting them using Windows-specific APIs and stored encryption keys.\n   - It searches for sensitive keywords (e.g., 'password', 'secret', 'wallet', 'metamask', 'crypto', 'paypal', etc.) in user files and browser data.\n   - It collects and decrypts stored passwords, cookies, and potentially other sensitive information.\n\n2. **Token and Session Harvesting:**\n   - It scans log files and browser storage for tokens, including Discord tokens, Steam tokens, and other session identifiers.\n   - It verifies tokens and uploads them to remote servers.\n\n3. **Remote Data Transmission:**\n   - It sends stolen data (credentials, tokens, cookies, etc.) to remote servers via webhooks and transfer services.\n   - It uses requests and requests-based functions to POST data to external URLs.\n\n4. **Persistence and Evasion Techniques:**\n   - It attempts to install missing Python modules silently.\n   - It kills processes related to browsers and other applications to access their data files.\n   - It zips and uploads browser data and other files.\n\n5. **Credential and Password Stealing:**\n   - It extracts saved passwords from browsers' local databases.\n   - It searches for files with common credential-related keywords.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to stealthily collect, decrypt, and exfiltrate sensitive user data, including login credentials, cookies, tokens, and files, to attacker-controlled endpoints. This behavior is characteristic of malware, specifically info-stealers or credential stealers, and is highly malicious.",
