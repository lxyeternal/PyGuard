      "malicious_behavior": "The code fetches and executes arbitrary code from an external URL ('https://pastebin.com/raw/f84dfw0m') using `requests.get()` and `eval()`. This allows an attacker to run any malicious Python code on the host system, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or other harmful actions. The use of `eval()` on external content is a significant security risk and is a common technique in malicious scripts to execute payloads delivered remotely.",
