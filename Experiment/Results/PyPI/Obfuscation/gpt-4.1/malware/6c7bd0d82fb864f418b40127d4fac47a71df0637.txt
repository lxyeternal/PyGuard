      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing malware on a victim's machine. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, the hidden window, and the encoded command are all indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy, mimicking a legitimate Python package setup. The code is designed to infect Windows systems and can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or further compromise.",
