      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information without user consent. It gathers hostname, current working directory, username, local IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), and attempts to resolve a constructed hostname that encodes system details. It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external server ('https://425a2.rt11.ml'). The obfuscation of variable names, encoding of system info into hex, and the use of a custom setup class to execute this behavior during installation strongly suggest malicious intent, likely for reconnaissance or data theft.",
