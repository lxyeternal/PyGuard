      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of malware droppers, which are used to download and execute additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and non-standard argument names) is intended to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code can compromise the security of the system by executing arbitrary code from the internet.",
