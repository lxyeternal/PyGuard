      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs several suspicious actions indicative of malicious intent. It attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package if not present, which is often used for Windows COM automation. More concerningly, it creates a directory within the user's AppData folder and writes a 'background.js' JavaScript file containing obfuscated code that appears to manipulate web page content and possibly extract or modify sensitive data. Additionally, it creates a 'manifest.json' to load this script as a Chrome extension. The script then searches through common shortcut directories for '.lnk' files pointing to popular browsers and modifies their shortcuts to include a command-line argument to load the malicious extension. This behavior suggests the code aims to persist on the system, inject malicious extensions into browsers, and potentially steal data or perform other malicious activities without user consent.",
