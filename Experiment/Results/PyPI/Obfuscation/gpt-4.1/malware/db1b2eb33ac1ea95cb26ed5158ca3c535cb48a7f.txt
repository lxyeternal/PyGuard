      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed code that decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it at runtime. This technique is commonly used to hide malicious payloads, such as malware, backdoors, or unauthorized data exfiltration. The embedded base64 string, once decoded, executes additional code that could perform malicious actions, such as network requests, data theft, or system compromise. The use of __import__('builtins').exec and compile, combined with obfuscated variable names and base64 decoding, indicates an attempt to conceal malicious intent and evade static detection. Overall, this code is designed to run hidden, potentially harmful operations without clear visibility, classifying it as malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and dynamically executed payloads, including base64-encoded code that is decoded and executed at runtime. It appears to perform malicious activities such as hiding the cursor, creating animated or deceptive terminal outputs, and potentially executing arbitrary commands via system calls. The presence of encoded payloads, complex class structures, and functions designed to manipulate terminal display strongly suggest malicious intent, likely aimed at evading detection and executing harmful operations on the host system.",
