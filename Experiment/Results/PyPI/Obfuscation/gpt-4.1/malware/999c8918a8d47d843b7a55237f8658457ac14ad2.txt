      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious activity. It attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a remote server at IP 59.110.111.85 on port 8088. This is achieved by creating a socket, connecting to the remote host, and redirecting the socket's file descriptors to standard input, output, and error streams, then invoking an interactive shell. Additionally, it creates a file at /tmp/test1563.txt as a marker to prevent repeated execution. The presence of such reverse shell behavior indicates malicious intent, as it allows an attacker to gain remote control over the compromised system. The code also spawns this reverse shell in a separate thread, making detection and analysis more difficult.",
