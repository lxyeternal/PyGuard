      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It defines a function 'mal' that acts as a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. Upon installation of the package (via the custom PostInstallCommand), it connects to a remote server (http://46.101.114.247:80) and enters a loop where it waits for commands from the attacker. The attacker can send arbitrary shell commands to be executed on the victim's machine, change directories, or request files from the victim's filesystem (using the 'grab' command), which are then exfiltrated to the attacker's server. This allows the attacker to fully control the victim's system, steal files, and execute arbitrary code, representing a severe security risk. The malicious behavior is hidden in the installation process, making it stealthy and dangerous.",
