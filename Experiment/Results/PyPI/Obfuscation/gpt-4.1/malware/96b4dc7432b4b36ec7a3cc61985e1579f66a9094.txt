The use of a non-descriptive, randomly generated function name is a common technique used to hide malicious intent and evade detection. Without the source code of the 'main' module, it is impossible to determine the exact behavior of the function, but such obfuscation is a strong indicator of malicious activity. This function could perform harmful actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or other unauthorized operations. The code is designed to execute whatever logic is hidden in the obfuscated function, which is a typical pattern in malware droppers or loaders.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and is a sophisticated information stealer, commonly referred to as a 'stealer' or 'infostealer'. Its primary purpose is to exfiltrate sensitive user data from the victim's computer and send it to an external server controlled by the attacker. The code performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. **Credential and Cookie Theft**: It searches for and extracts saved passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data from browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) by accessing their local storage and decrypting the data using the system's master key.\n\n2. **Discord Token and Account Data Theft**: It scans for Discord tokens and related user data, including email, phone, badges, billing information, and friends list, by searching through Discord's local storage files and making API requests to Discord's servers using the stolen tokens.\n\n3. **Wallet and Cryptocurrency Data Theft**: The code specifically targets browser extensions and files related to cryptocurrency wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Atomic Wallet, Exodus) and exfiltrates their data.\n\n4. **File Grabbing**: It recursively searches the user's Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders for files with keywords related to accounts, passwords, wallets, and other sensitive information, then uploads these files to an external file hosting service (gofile.io) and sends the download links to the attacker's webhook.\n\n5. **Exfiltration**: All stolen data is sent to a hardcoded webhook (https://webhook.wyvern.lol) and/or uploaded to gofile.io, with the download links sent to the attacker's webhook. The code uses Discord-style webhooks for exfiltration, which is a common tactic in modern stealers.\n\n6. **Persistence and Evasion**: The code uses threading to speed up data collection and to avoid detection. It also attempts to install missing dependencies automatically, making it more robust and harder to stop.\n\n7. **Obfuscation**: The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, making analysis more difficult and attempting to evade signature-based detection.\n\n8. **System Information Collection**: It collects system information such as the victim's public IP address, username, geolocation, and more, and includes this in the exfiltrated data.\n\n**Potential Harm:**\n- Compromise of all online accounts (email, social media, banking, cryptocurrency, etc.) saved in browsers or Discord.\n- Theft of cryptocurrency assets from local wallets.\n- Exposure of private and sensitive documents.\n- Victim's identity and privacy are severely compromised.\n- The attacker can use the stolen data for further attacks, fraud, or resale on underground markets.\n\n**Conclusion:** This code is a full-featured, modern infostealer and should be considered extremely dangerous. It should not be executed under any circumstances.",
