It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is a data exfiltration technique. This behavior is hidden within the installation process, making it stealthy and potentially harmful, as it leaks private system information to an attacker-controlled server without the user's consent.",
