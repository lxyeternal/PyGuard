      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (YjfArYnCCcAZRmEqheMTmKtqZGIYonuY) that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making static analysis difficult and hiding its true intent. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a classic technique for running arbitrary, potentially harmful code (such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or further malware installation) during package installation. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and can compromise the system of anyone who installs this package. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis.",
