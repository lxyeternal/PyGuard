      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes an encrypted payload using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making static analysis difficult and hiding its true intent. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a classic technique for running arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. This behavior is typical of malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration tools, and can result in system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation. The obfuscated variable and class names further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
