      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The code checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a common technique used to hide malicious activity from the user. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote URL (https://esqueleslt.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is typical of malware droppers, which are used to download and run additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The rest of the code is a decoy, using a standard setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code is designed to compromise the system by downloading and executing potentially harmful software.",
