      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, upon installation (or potentially at interpreter exit), collects sensitive information from the host system, including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the system's hostname (via os.uname()), and the path of the package installation. It then encodes this information in base64 and exfiltrates it by making an HTTP GET request to an external server (https://kotko.org) with the data as a query parameter. This is a classic example of an information-stealing backdoor embedded in a package's setup script, which can be triggered simply by installing the package. Additionally, it creates a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' as a proof of execution. Such behavior is highly malicious as it leaks potentially identifying and sensitive information about the user's environment to an external attacker without consent.",
