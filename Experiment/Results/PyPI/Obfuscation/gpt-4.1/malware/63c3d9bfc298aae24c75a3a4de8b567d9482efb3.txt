      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (BIhDzJxrwxVzQWOVMiNEZMMWfJsDzHCZ) that, during the installation process, writes a Python file (code.py) to the system's temporary directory. This file contains the line 'import dshttpslib', which will execute any code present in the 'dshttpslib' module. After a short delay, the code executes this file as a subprocess. This behavior is highly suspicious and malicious for several reasons: 1) It executes arbitrary code during package installation, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. 2) The use of obfuscated class and variable names is a hallmark of malicious intent, aiming to evade detection. 3) The code attempts to import and run a potentially malicious or backdoored module ('dshttpslib'), which could be used to exfiltrate data, install further malware, or compromise the system. 4) The code does not inform the user or request consent for this execution. This kind of behavior can lead to remote code execution, data theft, or system compromise.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits the behavior of a full-featured information stealer and remote access trojan (RAT). The code connects to a remote server via socket.io and can receive and execute commands from the attacker. Its capabilities include:\n\n1. Credential Theft: It extracts and decrypts browser-stored passwords, cookies, credit card data, and browsing history from multiple browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave, etc.), and sends them to the attacker.\n2. Discord Token Stealing: It searches for Discord authentication tokens in various locations and exfiltrates them.\n3. File Exfiltration: It can search for, read, and upload files from the victim's system, including sensitive files like wallet backups and game store data.\n4. Keylogging: It can start a keylogger to capture and exfiltrate keystrokes.\n5. Screenshot and Webcam Capture: It can take screenshots and webcam photos and send them to the attacker.\n6. Remote Command Execution: It can execute arbitrary shell commands received from the attacker and return the output.\n7. Persistence: It copies itself to the Windows startup folder to maintain persistence.\n8. File Encryption/Decryption: It can encrypt or decrypt files on the victim's system, which could be used for ransomware purposes.\n9. System Information Gathering: It collects and exfiltrates system information such as hardware UUID, username, computer name, OS version, IP address, and more.\n10. Remote File Download/Upload: It can download and execute files from remote URLs, allowing the attacker to deploy additional payloads.\n\nThe code is heavily obfuscated with random variable names, but its intent is clear: to steal as much sensitive information as possible from the victim and provide the attacker with remote control over the system. This code poses a severe risk to user privacy, data security, and system integrity.",
