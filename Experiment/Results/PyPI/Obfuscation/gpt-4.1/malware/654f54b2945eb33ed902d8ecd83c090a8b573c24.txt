It constructs a unique identifier string and attempts to resolve a hardcoded external domain ('https://425a2.rt11.ml') by sending a POST request with the collected data. This behavior indicates data exfiltration or beaconing to a remote server, which is characteristic of malicious malware or spyware. The obfuscation, network activity, and data collection without user consent strongly suggest malicious intent.",
