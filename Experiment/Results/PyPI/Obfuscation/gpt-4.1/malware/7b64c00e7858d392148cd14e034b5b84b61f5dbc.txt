It then exfiltrates this data by sending it via an HTTP GET request to an external server ('https://1y05ug5pi97xa0bk2bjhdwp5yw4nsdg2.oastify.com'). This behavior indicates data theft or reconnaissance activity, which is characteristic of malicious code. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation tasks beyond this data exfiltration, confirming its malicious intent.",
