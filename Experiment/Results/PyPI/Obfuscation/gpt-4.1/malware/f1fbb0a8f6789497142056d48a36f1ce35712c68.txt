      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command (when decoded) downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a classic example of a downloader/dropper, which is used to fetch and execute additional malware on the victim's machine. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded PowerShell is a common technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package. This code can lead to remote code execution, compromise of the system, and further malicious activity.",
