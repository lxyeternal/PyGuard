      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom installation class that, during the setup process, gathers system information such as hostname, current working directory, username, and network interface IP addresses. It then encodes and obfuscates this data, constructs a unique identifier, and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious external domain (https://425a2.rt11.ml). This behavior suggests data exfiltration or fingerprinting of the infected system, which is characteristic of malicious activity. The code's obfuscation, use of hex encoding, and external communication to a potentially malicious server strongly indicate malicious intent, likely for tracking, reconnaissance, or command-and-control purposes.",
