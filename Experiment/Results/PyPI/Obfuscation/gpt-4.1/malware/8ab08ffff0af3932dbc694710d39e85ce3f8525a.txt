      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and suspicious behavior indicative of malware. It decodes and executes a base64-encoded payload that, when decoded, performs a subprocess call to download and extract a ZIP file from an external URL (https://transfer.sh/WULklK/Updater.zip). It then runs a PowerShell command to install numerous potentially malicious Python packages and executes a script (server.pyw) from the extracted directory. This behavior suggests the code is designed to silently download, install, and execute malicious payloads, potentially establishing persistence, stealing data, or enabling remote control. The use of obfuscation, silent downloads, and execution of external scripts are common tactics in malware, confirming the malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions and obfuscated structures that suggest malicious intent, such as functions for hiding the cursor, manipulating terminal output, and generating animated or deceptive terminal graphics. The presence of complex, intentionally convoluted code, along with functions that can overwrite or obscure terminal content, indicates it may be used for malicious purposes like disguising malicious activity, creating fake interfaces, or executing hidden commands. Additionally, the code references 'developer area' and includes obfuscated class and function names, which are common in malware or malicious scripts designed to evade detection. Overall, the code appears to be designed for malicious or deceptive terminal manipulation, potentially to hide malicious actions or deceive users.",
