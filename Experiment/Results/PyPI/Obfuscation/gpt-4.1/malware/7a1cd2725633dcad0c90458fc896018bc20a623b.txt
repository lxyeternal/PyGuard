      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (NKSJaMrhcgngiHnqfcZvlhjpfMykxugP) that, when run on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts and executes a block of encrypted Python code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is not visible in the source, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and likely malicious. This technique is commonly used to hide malware, such as credential stealers, backdoors, or downloaders, from static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution during package installation. The code is designed to execute only on Windows, further suggesting targeting of a specific user base. The presence of setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests' ensures the necessary dependencies for decryption and network communication are installed, which is typical for malware that exfiltrates data or downloads further payloads.",
