      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and suspicious behavior indicative of malicious intent. Specifically, it decrypts and executes a Fernet-encrypted payload only on Windows systems ('nt' OS). The use of encrypted payloads, conditional execution based on OS, and the execution of dynamically decrypted code are common tactics in malicious scripts to evade detection and execute harmful actions. The payload is not visible in plaintext, making it likely designed to perform malicious activities such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or further downloading malicious content. Additionally, the code's obfuscation and the use of non-descriptive variable names further suggest malicious intent.",
