      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It performs the following actions: (1) Creates a hidden directory on the C: drive named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK', which mimics a legitimate Windows system folder to avoid suspicion. (2) Downloads two executable files from Discord CDN URLs, which is a common tactic for distributing malware. (3) Saves these executables to the created directory with random-looking names. (4) Executes both downloaded executables using os.startfile, which will run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. (5) Attempts to clean up by deleting the temporary directory and the original downloaded files, likely to cover its tracks. The code is designed to infect the system with potentially harmful executables, which could be ransomware, stealers, or other forms of malware. The use of obfuscated variable names and the attempt to mimic system folders further indicate an intent to deceive and evade detection.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It downloads an executable file ('main.exe') from a remote URL (hosted on Discord's CDN), saves it to disk, renames it to 'XMICNEI.exe' in a suspiciously named directory ('C:\\$Windows.~SXK'), and then executes it. The use of a hidden or system-like directory name and the execution of a remotely downloaded binary are classic indicators of malware delivery and execution. This can lead to the system being compromised, as the downloaded executable could be any form of malware (e.g., ransomware, trojan, backdoor). The code does not perform any validation or user notification, further confirming its malicious intent.",
