      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It collects sensitive information from the host system, including the current call stack, environment variable names, system information (os.uname()), and the public IP address (via https://ipinfo.io/ip). It then encodes this data as JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a remote server (the URL is base64-encoded and decodes to a Slack webhook endpoint). The code attempts to evade detection by checking the hostname and script filename, avoiding execution on certain machines or when run as specific scripts. This is classic exfiltration behavior, where potentially sensitive information is sent to an external attacker-controlled endpoint, which can be used for reconnaissance, further attacks, or data theft.",
