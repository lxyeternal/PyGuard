      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594940/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This is a classic remote code execution and malware delivery technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags and the obfuscation via base64 encoding are clear indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to appear as a legitimate Python package setup script. If executed, this code will compromise the system by running untrusted code from the internet, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware infection.",
