      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (AfterInstall) that, after a user installs the package (e.g., via pip), executes a hidden payload. The payload is base64-encoded and decodes to the command 'curl http://localhost/rev.sh', which is executed via os.system. This means that upon installation, the package will attempt to download (and possibly execute) a script from a local web server (http://localhost/rev.sh). In a real-world attack, this URL could be changed to a remote server, allowing the attacker to deliver and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This is a classic example of a malicious 'post-install' hook in a Python package, often used in supply chain attacks. The use of base64 encoding is an attempt to obfuscate the malicious command and evade detection.",
