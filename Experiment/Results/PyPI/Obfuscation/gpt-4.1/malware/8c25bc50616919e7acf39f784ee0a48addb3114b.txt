      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload, when decoded, runs a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150599404/Esquele.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then executing it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags and encoded PowerShell commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script. This code, if run, will compromise the system by downloading and running an untrusted executable, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware infection.",
