      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered (such as during package installation), collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com), which is a common technique for exfiltrating data to an attacker-controlled server. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This behavior constitutes a privacy violation and can be used for reconnaissance or further attacks.",
