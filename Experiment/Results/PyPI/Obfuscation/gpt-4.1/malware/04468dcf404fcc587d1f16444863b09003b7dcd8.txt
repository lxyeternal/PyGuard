      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory and then running it. This behavior is typical of malware droppers, which are used to download and execute additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and misleading setup metadata) further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code is designed to run as part of a Python package installation, making it especially dangerous as it could be distributed via a supply chain attack.",
