It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects the victim's hostname and local IP address using socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname(). It then sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL using the discord.py and aiohttp libraries. This exfiltration of system information without user consent is a clear privacy violation and is commonly used in malware to fingerprint or track infected systems. The use of obfuscated class and function names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code is designed to execute automatically upon package installation, making it particularly dangerous in a supply chain attack scenario.",
