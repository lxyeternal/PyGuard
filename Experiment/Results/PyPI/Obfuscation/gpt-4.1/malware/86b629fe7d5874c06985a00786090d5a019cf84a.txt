      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a sophisticated downloader and executor of remote payloads. It constructs URLs based on the system architecture, retrieves encrypted data from these URLs, decrypts it, saves it as an executable file in a hidden directory, sets executable permissions, and then executes it. Additionally, it performs a file system scan for specific directories and files, possibly to avoid detection or to trigger specific behavior. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted URL components, and dynamic code execution strongly suggests malicious intent, such as installing malware, backdoors, or remote access tools on the compromised system.",
