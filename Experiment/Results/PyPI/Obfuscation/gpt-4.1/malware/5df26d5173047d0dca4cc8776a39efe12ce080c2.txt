      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command that, during the installation process, executes a base64-encoded shell command which, when decoded and run, establishes a reverse shell connection to a remote server at IP 13.93.28.37 on port 8888. This reverse shell allows an attacker to gain remote control over the compromised system, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or further malicious activities. The use of obfuscated variable names and the execution of encoded commands are typical indicators of malicious intent.",
