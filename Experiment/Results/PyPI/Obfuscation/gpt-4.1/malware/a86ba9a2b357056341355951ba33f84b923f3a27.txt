      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that perform covert DNS queries to a specified domain, likely for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. Specifically, the function `vNwOxGuouvmZvFVBTUDfgFNMbgBRVXTS` constructs and sends DNS packets to a local DNS server, and `qPfYCahOVGciRwowahhUnbZEhNNiYLqh` gathers system information, encodes it in hex, splits it into chunks, and transmits each chunk via DNS queries to a domain constructed with the local hostname and other identifiers. This behavior is characteristic of malware that exfiltrates data stealthily using DNS traffic, which is a common technique to evade detection. The code is embedded within setup commands, making it likely to be part of a malicious package designed to execute during installation or development phases, further indicating malicious intent.",
