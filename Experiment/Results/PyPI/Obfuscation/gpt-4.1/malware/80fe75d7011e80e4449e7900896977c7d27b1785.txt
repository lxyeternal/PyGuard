      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and heavily encrypted payloads that execute dynamically decoded and decompressed code, likely to evade detection. It appears to be part of a malicious bot that interacts with Telegram, possibly to perform unauthorized file sharing or command execution. The functions execute base64-encoded, zlib-compressed, and marshaled code, which suggests an attempt to hide malicious activities such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or covert communication. Additionally, the code attempts to delete files and messages in response to specific commands (e.g., 'webshare'), indicating malicious intent to clean up traces after executing harmful payloads. Overall, this code is designed to run concealed, potentially malicious operations, and should be considered malicious.",
