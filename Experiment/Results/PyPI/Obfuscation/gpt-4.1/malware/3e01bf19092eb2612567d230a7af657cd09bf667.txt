It performs the following malicious activities:\n\n- Collects Discord tokens, user information, billing details, badges, friends, and server data by accessing Discord's API endpoints.\n- Extracts stored passwords and cookies from popular browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) and browser extensions like MetaMask.\n- Reads and decrypts stored credentials and cookies using Windows API functions, indicating it targets Windows systems.\n- Searches user directories for files containing passwords, account info, or wallet data, then uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services.\n- Collects and exfiltrates browser session tokens, cookies, and other sensitive data.\n- Sends all gathered data to a specified Discord webhook, effectively stealing user credentials, session tokens, cookies, passwords, and other personal information.\n- Uses threading to perform data collection concurrently, making it efficient and harder to detect.\n\nOverall, this code is a comprehensive credential stealer and data exfiltration tool, clearly intended for malicious purposes such as identity theft, account hijacking, and privacy invasion.",
