      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload. The payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is typical of a downloader or dropper, which is used to infect the system with additional malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded command, as well as the obfuscation and silent error handling, are clear indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code (the setup() call) is a decoy to make the script look like a legitimate Python package setup script.",
