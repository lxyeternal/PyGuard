      "malicious_behavior": "The code embeds functions that perform covert network communications and data exfiltration. Specifically, the function `wvrTBZJsNOCJFCFDhvdHmXhUbAELlJTX` constructs and sends DNS queries to a specified DNS server (default 127.0.0.53) with custom payloads, which can be used to transmit data stealthily. Additionally, the function `xWWGiezhEnmPkZNqfGZWLdcYXcddcOas` gathers system information (hostname, user, current directory) and encodes it into a hex string, then splits and transmits this data via DNS queries with crafted domain names. The code is integrated into setup commands (`install`, `develop`, `egg_info`) so that it executes during package installation or development, enabling persistent and covert data exfiltration. This behavior is characteristic of malware or backdoor activity designed to stealthily communicate with a command-and-control server or attacker-controlled infrastructure.",
