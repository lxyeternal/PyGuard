Specifically, it appears to download and execute remote scripts from URLs associated with malicious domains, potentially installing backdoors, malware, or remote access tools. The presence of base64-encoded strings that are decoded and executed dynamically indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code references network communication, remote script execution, and possibly command-and-control server interactions, which are typical behaviors of malware or remote access trojans (RATs). Overall, the code is designed to covertly fetch and run malicious code, making it highly malicious.",
