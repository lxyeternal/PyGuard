      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements custom proxy resolver and connector classes that facilitate the creation and chaining of multiple proxies, including support for SOCKS proxies via the 'python_socks' library. The presence of functions that parse proxy URLs, create proxy chains, and manage multiple proxies suggests an intent to route network traffic through potentially obfuscated or multiple proxy layers. This behavior can be exploited for malicious purposes such as hiding the origin of network activity, conducting anonymous communications, or bypassing network restrictions. The code does not contain explicit malicious payloads like data exfiltration, command execution, or malware delivery, but its design to obscure network traffic and dynamically manage proxies indicates a high potential for malicious use, especially in contexts where anonymity and evasion are desired.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to establish network connections through proxies, potentially for anonymized or hidden communication. It uses the 'python_socks' library to create and connect via proxies, which can be exploited to route traffic covertly. The obfuscated variable names and the fact that it creates proxy connections and then forwards or relays data suggest it could be used for malicious purposes such as hiding command-and-control traffic, exfiltrating data, or participating in botnet activities. The code does not perform any explicit benign function and seems tailored to conceal network activity, indicating malicious intent.",
