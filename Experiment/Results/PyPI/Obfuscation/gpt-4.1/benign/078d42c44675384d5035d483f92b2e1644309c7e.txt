      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to download and execute a 'cloudflared' binary tailored for the host system, which is a legitimate tool used for tunneling and exposing local services. However, the context and manner in which it is used suggest malicious intent: it dynamically fetches binaries from external URLs, sets executable permissions, and runs them without user consent or verification. Additionally, it sets up a local tunnel and exposes metrics, which could be exploited for command and control, data exfiltration, or unauthorized access. The code also employs obfuscation techniques (e.g., nonsensical variable names, indirect function calls) typical of malicious scripts aiming to hide their true purpose. Overall, this pattern of behavior—automatic binary download, execution, and network tunneling—indicates malicious intent, likely for establishing persistent backdoors or covert channels.",
