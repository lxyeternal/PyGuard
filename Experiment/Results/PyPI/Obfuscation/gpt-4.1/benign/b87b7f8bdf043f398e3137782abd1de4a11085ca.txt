      "malicious_behavior": "The code actively uninstalls the 'chromedriver_installer' package, removes existing chromedriver executables from the system, and then proceeds to install specific versions of chromedriver with custom options. It also performs version checks and manipulates files in temporary directories, which can be used to hide malicious payloads or interfere with browser automation tools. These actions suggest an intent to manipulate or control the environment for malicious purposes, such as hiding malicious automation, preventing detection, or maintaining persistence. Overall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious scripts designed to interfere with system components and evade detection.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a malicious Python setup script that downloads and extracts a ChromeDriver binary from external sources, potentially to execute or manipulate browser automation without user consent. It retrieves the latest ChromeDriver version, downloads the corresponding ZIP file, verifies its checksum, and extracts it to a temporary directory. This behavior can be used to silently install or update malicious browser drivers, facilitating automated malware delivery, browser hijacking, or other malicious activities. The obfuscated variable names and the focus on downloading external binaries are common indicators of malicious intent.",
