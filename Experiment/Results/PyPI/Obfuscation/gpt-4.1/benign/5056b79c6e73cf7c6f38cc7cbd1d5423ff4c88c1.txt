      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs automated translation requests to Google Translate and extracts specific HTML content from the response. While on the surface it appears to be a translation utility, the presence of obfuscated variable names and the pattern of fetching and parsing web content suggest it could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, scraping sensitive information, or bypassing restrictions. The code does not include any explicit malicious payloads like malware delivery, but its obfuscation and web scraping behavior are common in malicious scripts designed to covertly gather data or perform unauthorized actions. Therefore, it is classified as malicious due to its potential for misuse and obfuscation.",
