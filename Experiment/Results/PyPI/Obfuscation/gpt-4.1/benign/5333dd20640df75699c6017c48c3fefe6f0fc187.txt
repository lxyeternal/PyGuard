      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be designed for pattern matching and extraction of data based on regex patterns. While the code itself does not contain overtly malicious functions like data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or system modification, its structure suggests it could be used as part of a malicious payload. Specifically, the class methods perform regex-based searches and collect matching data, which could be exploited to scrape sensitive information, identify specific patterns in data streams, or facilitate covert data collection. The lack of context and the obfuscated class and variable names further raise suspicion, as such obfuscation is common in malicious scripts to evade detection. Overall, the code's behavior aligns with typical data harvesting or reconnaissance activities often associated with malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to process input data by optionally decoding it from base64 and then passing it to a function that likely computes a hash or performs some form of cryptographic operation. The class and method names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The use of base64 decoding suggests it may be trying to conceal payloads or data, and the subsequent hashing or processing could be part of a fingerprinting, verification, or command-and-control communication mechanism. Overall, the obfuscation, data decoding, and cryptographic processing strongly indicate malicious behavior, potentially for covert data exfiltration, command execution, or evading detection.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a large set of regex patterns associated with various hash formats, password schemes, and credential types, many of which are well-known in password cracking and security research contexts. The presence of numerous entries labeled with specific hashes, hash types, and references to cracking tools (e.g., 'hashcat mode', 'john', 'john2', 'john in passthrough mode') indicates that this code is intended to identify, classify, or extract password hashes from data. The extensive list of hash formats, especially those related to password hashes, encrypted credentials, and system-specific hashes (e.g., Windows NTLM, Kerberos, LDAP, database hashes, VPN, and application-specific hashes), suggests that this code is used for security testing, password recovery, or potentially malicious credential extraction. The inclusion of hashes for sensitive systems and the detailed pattern matching strongly indicates malicious intent, such as password cracking or credential harvesting, rather than benign functionality.",

It processes hash objects, filters based on popularity, and formats output in a way that could be used to exfiltrate or display sensitive hash information. The obfuscated variable and class names, combined with the use of a custom hash info module and conditional logic that suppresses certain outputs, suggest an intent to hide its true purpose.

This pattern is typical of malicious scripts that execute hidden or harmful code, such as malware, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines.
