It prompts the user to confirm upgrades, then executes 'pip install --upgrade' commands for each package, potentially causing unintended updates or system instability. Additionally, it rewrites the requirements file with the updated package versions, which could be used to mask or manipulate package dependencies. Overall, this behavior can be considered malicious because it alters system packages without explicit approval, potentially leading to security risks, system compromise, or disruption.",
