      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that clone a Git repository, add all files, commit with a specific message, and push changes back to the repository. This behavior suggests the code can modify remote repositories without explicit user consent, potentially uploading malicious or unauthorized files. Additionally, the code appears to generate various output files (JSON, YAML, HTML, CSV, Markdown, Mindmap) based on network device commands, which could be used to exfiltrate sensitive network information. The combination of automated repository modification and data exfiltration indicates malicious intent, such as unauthorized data collection, persistence, or distribution of malicious payloads.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module or object with an obfuscated name and calls a function with an obfuscated name. The lack of meaningful identifiers and the use of seemingly random or nonsensical names suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. Without access to the implementation of 'KMciyZeiKLHJlMYIlnkIeerKcfRVGgMH', it is highly likely that this function performs malicious actions such as executing hidden payloads, establishing unauthorized connections, or manipulating system behavior. The obfuscation and minimal code structure are common tactics used in malicious scripts to evade detection and conceal harmful activities.",
