      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be obfuscated and contains suspicious elements that suggest malicious intent. Specifically, it reads the contents of 'README.md' into a variable but does not use it further, which could be a tactic to hide malicious payloads or exfiltrate data. Additionally, the code modifies configuration variables related to compiler flags, potentially to disable security checks or introduce malicious compiler behavior. The presence of a seemingly random string 'uKoAXdfaMweYsQJBuBZSTjKQReoizqpU=' assigned to the 'classifiers' parameter, which is normally a list of strings, indicates obfuscation or manipulation aimed at hiding malicious intent. Overall, these behaviors—reading files without clear purpose, obfuscation, and modification of build configurations—are common in malicious scripts designed to evade detection and perform harmful actions during or after execution.",
