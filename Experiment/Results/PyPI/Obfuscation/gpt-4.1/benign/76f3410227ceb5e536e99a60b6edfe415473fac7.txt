      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a custom authentication and session management system that appears designed to operate covertly. It stores user sessions, tokens, and device trust information in JSON files, and includes functions for creating, validating, and invalidating tokens. The presence of obfuscated variable names, dynamic token creation, and device trust management suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code can set cookies, track device information, and verify user credentials in a way that could be exploited for unauthorized access, session hijacking, or persistent tracking. Overall, the code's structure and behavior indicate it is intended for malicious purposes, such as unauthorized user impersonation, session fixation, or covert user tracking, rather than legitimate authentication handling.",
