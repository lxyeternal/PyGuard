      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be a wrapper around command-line tools like ffmpeg and ffprobe, allowing execution of external processes with customizable arguments. While on the surface it seems to facilitate media processing, the code's structure and obfuscated variable names suggest an intent to hide malicious activity. The code can execute arbitrary commands, handle subprocesses asynchronously or synchronously, and potentially process or exfiltrate data without clear transparency. The presence of custom exceptions that include detailed command output and error information further indicates it could be used to conceal malicious operations or exfiltrate sensitive data. Overall, the code's design and obfuscation patterns are typical of malicious scripts aiming to execute arbitrary commands covertly, making it suspicious and potentially malicious.",
