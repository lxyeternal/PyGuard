      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports obfuscated identifiers from the 'certifi' module, which is a legitimate package used for SSL certificate validation. However, the imported names ('IqmADcXwuMEllMJHmPKpGyJKiZbGcNRD' and 'eEIZTSASukfoEiKQrOxLyVaXXFyVXJcv') are highly unusual and do not correspond to any known functions or variables within 'certifi'. The script then uses these obfuscated names as function calls, which suggests that it is executing code or functions that are hidden or intentionally obscured. This pattern indicates an attempt to hide malicious behavior, such as executing malicious payloads or exfiltrating data, under the guise of legitimate library calls. The code's structure and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, especially since it relies on obscure identifiers and conditional execution based on command-line arguments, which could be used to trigger malicious actions silently.",
