      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports modules from the 'coinbasepro' library but uses obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers for the module names, such as 'CjHugbSepeWdQFnigazrMtDJSYNNgKlw' and 'vEfnIEtlisqXBNDQtSNfOjNzHZorPxGd'. This pattern suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent or evade detection. Such obfuscation is commonly used in malicious scripts to conceal their true purpose, which may include unauthorized access to cryptocurrency accounts, theft of funds, or other malicious activities related to cryptocurrency trading. The code does not perform any legitimate operations and appears designed solely to deceive or compromise security.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a token bucket rate limiter, which is a common technique to control the rate of certain actions, such as network requests or API calls. However, the use of obfuscated class and method names, along with the import from a seemingly suspicious module (`coinbasepro.token_bucket` with a non-standard class name), suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code could be used to stealthily limit or manipulate the rate of operations, potentially to evade detection or to perform unauthorized actions at a controlled rate. Without additional context, this pattern is often associated with malicious activity such as throttling or covertly controlling the execution of harmful operations. Therefore, the code is flagged as malicious due to its obfuscation and potential for covert control.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated client library for interacting with the Coinbase Pro API. The obfuscation includes nonsensical class and method names, as well as import statements referencing non-standard or suspicious exception classes. While the core functionality seems to be fetching market data, trading, and account info, the obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide its true purpose. Such techniques are common in malicious scripts aiming to disguise malicious intent or evade detection. Without explicit malicious functions like data exfiltration, command-and-control communication, or payload delivery, the code itself does not directly exhibit malicious behavior. However, the obfuscation and the context imply it could be used as part of a malicious operation, such as automated trading for fraud, scraping sensitive data, or integrating into a larger malicious framework. Therefore, it is flagged as potentially malicious due to its obfuscated nature and suspicious import references.",
