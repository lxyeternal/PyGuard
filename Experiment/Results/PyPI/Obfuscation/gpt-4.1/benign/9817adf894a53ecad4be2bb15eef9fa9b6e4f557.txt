      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to set up an HTTP proxy or server that forwards requests to an upstream server, with the ability to cache requests in a specified directory. While this functionality can be legitimate, the code contains obfuscated variable and function names, imports from a module with a non-descriptive name, and lacks transparency about its purpose. Such characteristics are common in malicious scripts designed to hide their true intent. Additionally, the code's structure suggests it may be used to intercept, log, or manipulate network traffic covertly. Without explicit documentation or context, this suspicious obfuscation and the potential for malicious network behavior indicate that the code is likely malicious or at least intended for malicious purposes.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a malicious or unauthorized OpenID Connect (OIDC) server that generates and signs JWT tokens with potentially arbitrary or self-signed keys. It can serve tokens and JWKS endpoints, which could be exploited to impersonate users or services, facilitate token forgery, or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks. The server can generate private keys on the fly, store them locally, and provide tokens without proper validation or authorization, indicating malicious intent to impersonate legitimate identity providers or intercept sensitive authentication flows.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a sophisticated HTTP server that can proxy requests, handle multiple protocols (HTTP/HTTPS), and manage connections asynchronously. It includes mechanisms for intercepting, logging, and storing request and response data, including request headers, bodies, and response details, into files with pickle serialization. The presence of functions that save request/response data to disk, combined with the ability to run as a server, suggests potential for malicious activities such as data exfiltration, request interception, or acting as a command-and-control (C2) proxy. The code's obfuscated class and variable names, along with its flexible request handling and storage capabilities, are typical of malicious or covert tools designed to monitor, log, or manipulate network traffic surreptitiously.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code sets up a custom HTTP server that appears to handle webhook events, likely from GitHub, and then forwards these events to a specified URL using the 'gh' CLI tool. The server reads incoming data, processes it, and writes it to a cache directory. The key concern is the use of the 'subprocess.check_call' to invoke 'gh webhook forward' with a URL derived from the server, which could be exploited to redirect or exfiltrate data. Additionally, the code's obfuscated class and method names, combined with the behavior of forwarding webhook data to an external URL, suggest malicious intent, such as intercepting, logging, or exfiltrating webhook payloads without user consent. Overall, this code could be used to hijack or monitor GitHub webhook traffic maliciously.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code sets up a fake HTTP server that responds with 'what up' to incoming requests, and then performs multiple HTTP requests to this server, including attempts to access specific endpoints and simulate interactions with temporary directories and files. It also intentionally raises an HTTPError when requesting a certain endpoint, which could be used to mimic or manipulate network interactions. The obfuscated class and function names, combined with the use of a custom test server and the pattern of making HTTP requests and handling errors, suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent or to simulate malicious network behavior. Overall, this code appears designed to perform covert network interactions, possibly for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, command and control, or testing malicious payloads in a controlled environment.",
