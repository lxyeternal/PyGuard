      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. The setup.py script defines a package with a random-looking name ('jv4pow4vhqjaqtn0') and uses a non-standard keyword argument ('cLmfoBaTkbEDZjopiByHfdnEWyRDdTWq') instead of the standard 'version', which is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. More importantly, the install_requires list includes several suspicious or non-standard packages: 'python-tracing', 'shopee-sp-protocol', 'garena-common', and 'loggingtool-shopee'. These package names are not widely recognized and may be typosquats or malicious packages designed to execute harmful code upon installation. The use of a setup.py file to install such dependencies is a known vector for supply chain attacks, where installing the package can lead to the execution of arbitrary code with the user's privileges. Therefore, this code is considered malicious due to its obfuscation, suspicious dependencies, and potential for harmful side effects.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits suspicious and potentially malicious behavior. It imports several internal modules and then, regardless of the main program logic, attempts to spawn a new Python subprocess that imports the 'shopeeloggingtool.dist_util' module. This is done silently, and if the first attempt fails, it tries again with a slightly different import statement, suppressing warnings. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute Python code in a new process, especially with modules that are not standard and may be unknown or custom ('shopeeloggingtool'), is a common technique for evading detection, running code in a separate context, or performing actions outside the main process's visibility. This could be used to exfiltrate data, establish persistence, or perform other unauthorized actions. The code also suppresses all exceptions, making its behavior stealthy. These are all hallmarks of malicious code.",
