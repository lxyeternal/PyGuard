It also opens web browser tabs to specific URLs, which could be used for phishing, tracking, or redirecting users to malicious sites. Additionally, the code appears to process and save large image datasets, potentially exfiltrating or manipulating sensitive data. The presence of obfuscated function names and the ability to delete files and automate web browsing suggest malicious intent, such as data theft, system disruption, or user tracking.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that perform unauthorized file operations, such as copying image data blocks between files, and potentially manipulating or extracting sensitive image data without user consent. The presence of functions that read, write, and copy large image datasets, combined with obfuscated function names and lack of clear documentation, suggests an intent to hide malicious activities. Additionally, the code can process various image formats and may be used to exfiltrate or manipulate image data covertly. The use of obscure function names and the ability to copy image blocks could be exploited for malicious purposes such as data theft, image tampering, or covert data exfiltration.",
