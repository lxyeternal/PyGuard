      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains obfuscated variable names and a suspicious dictionary comprehension that appears to be designed to process or filter data. The key aspect is that the code uses undefined or nonsensical variable names, which is a common obfuscation technique used in malicious scripts to hide their true intent. Additionally, the code attempts to create a new dictionary by iterating over an input dictionary and excluding entries where the value is None. While this in itself is not inherently malicious, the obfuscation and lack of clarity suggest an intent to hide malicious behavior or payloads. Without further context, the code's purpose is suspicious, and it could be part of a larger malicious script designed to manipulate data covertly or evade detection. Therefore, it is classified as malicious due to its obfuscation and potential for hidden malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated or intentionally scrambled implementation of an API client, which performs network requests and processes responses. Notably, it manipulates headers such as 'X-Goog-Visitor-Id' based on response data, and raises exceptions when responses are not JSON or contain errors. The obfuscation and the way it handles response data—especially the setting of visitor IDs—are common tactics in malicious scripts aiming to exfiltrate or hijack user data, track users covertly, or perform unauthorized API interactions. The code's structure and obfuscation suggest it is designed to hide its true intent, which is characteristic of malicious or at least suspicious code.",
