      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom installation command for a Python package. During installation (i.e., when 'python setup.py install' is run), it executes the shell command 'ls /' to list the contents of the root directory and prints the result. While this specific command only lists files and does not directly cause harm, the use of os.popen to execute arbitrary shell commands during installation is a common technique used in malicious packages to perform unauthorized actions on the user's system. This behavior is considered malicious because it violates user trust and can be easily modified to perform more harmful actions, such as exfiltrating data or installing malware. The code demonstrates a pattern often seen in supply chain attacks via Python packages.",
