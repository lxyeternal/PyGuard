      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be a setup script for a Python package, but it contains obfuscated and suspicious elements that suggest malicious intent. Notably, it reads a README file, dynamically constructs file paths, and defines build configurations in a convoluted manner. The key concern is the variable 'QZgVIwIxLbazSiySVvHVjpJEyAABpQST', which concatenates seemingly random strings with a variable that could be used to fetch or execute malicious payloads. Additionally, the code's obfuscation and lack of clear purpose, combined with the potential to execute or include malicious code during installation or build processes, indicate malicious behavior. This could be used to hide malware, backdoors, or unwanted payloads within a seemingly legitimate package setup, making it potentially harmful if executed.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to spawn multiple processes that execute specific functions which perform assertions and possibly process data related to SWMM (Storm Water Management Model) input files. The use of multiprocessing to launch numerous processes without clear purpose, combined with the obfuscated import names and the lack of meaningful comments, suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code could be used to overwhelm system resources (denial-of-service) or to execute hidden malicious operations within the invoked functions, especially since the functions called (`UWG...`, `OFyPE...`, etc.) are not standard and their implementations are unknown. The overall structure and obfuscation strongly indicate malicious behavior, such as resource exhaustion or covert data processing, rather than legitimate application logic.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be a heavily obfuscated wrapper around a native extension module (_swmm5). It defines numerous functions and variables with nonsensical or randomized names, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The code does not perform any obvious benign operations; instead, it seems designed to load and expose internal functions from a native library, potentially to execute malicious payloads or unauthorized operations. The obfuscation and the lack of clear, legitimate functionality strongly suggest malicious behavior, such as hiding malicious API calls, facilitating remote code execution, or bypassing security detection.",
