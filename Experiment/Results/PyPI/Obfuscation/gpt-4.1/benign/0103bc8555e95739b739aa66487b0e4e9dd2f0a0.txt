      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated, with variable names that are nonsensical and imported functions with seemingly random names. The assignment `B = business` suggests that `business` might be a predefined object or function, but without further context, it is suspicious. The obfuscation pattern and lack of meaningful logic strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoor access, or other harmful activities. Overall, the code's structure and style are typical of malicious scripts designed to evade detection and analysis.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains obfuscated and suspicious functions that could be used to manipulate data or perform covert operations. Notably, the code redefines the built-in 'round' function with a custom implementation that involves complex calculations, which could be used to hide malicious rounding behaviors or interfere with numerical computations. Additionally, the code defines functions that handle iterables and perform mathematical operations, but their purpose is ambiguous and may serve as a means to process or exfiltrate data covertly. The presence of obfuscated variable names and the lack of clear, legitimate functionality strongly suggest malicious intent, such as data manipulation, evasion, or covert communication. Overall, the code exhibits characteristics typical of malicious or obfuscated scripts designed to conceal their true purpose.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be obfuscated and includes functions that process data in a way that suggests it could be used for malicious purposes such as data exfiltration, covert communication, or evading detection. The use of non-descriptive, randomized variable and function names, along with the import of seemingly arbitrary functions from a utils module, indicates an attempt to hide the true intent. The code computes statistical measures (mean, median, quartiles, max, min) on input data, which could be used to analyze or manipulate data streams covertly. Overall, these characteristics are typical of malicious scripts designed to evade detection and perform hidden operations.",
