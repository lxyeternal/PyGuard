      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains multiple functions that facilitate malicious activities such as keylogging, screen capturing, file exfiltration, and remote command execution. Notably, functions like 'UrnqBaYswxFUaweQAZgnRkoblWsYwaYD' implement a keylogger that captures keystrokes and mouse positions, storing them for potential exfiltration. Other functions enable downloading and encoding images, videos, and web content, which can be used to exfiltrate data covertly. Additionally, the code includes functions for automating keyboard and mouse actions, which can be exploited for unauthorized control of the victim's system. The presence of obfuscated function names and the combination of web scraping, file handling, and automation strongly suggest malicious intent, likely for espionage, data theft, or system compromise.",
