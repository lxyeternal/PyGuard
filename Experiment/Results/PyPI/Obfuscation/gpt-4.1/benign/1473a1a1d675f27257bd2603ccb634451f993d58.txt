      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed for malicious purposes, specifically to exfiltrate or manipulate data within a Snowflake environment. It loads configuration files, connects to Snowflake using potentially sensitive credentials, and executes arbitrary SQL commands. The use of obfuscated variable and function names, along with the ability to execute dynamically rendered SQL files, suggests an intent to hide malicious activities such as unauthorized data access, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. Additionally, the code's structure allows it to run potentially harmful SQL commands without explicit user consent, indicating malicious intent.",
