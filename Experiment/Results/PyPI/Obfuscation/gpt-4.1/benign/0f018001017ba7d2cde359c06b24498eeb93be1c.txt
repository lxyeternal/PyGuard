      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be obfuscated and contains several indicators of malicious intent. It imports a non-standard, likely malicious module (`JnJiMQtogTjMQITpEnMwvYdkGgntBSGI`) and uses nonsensical variable and function names, which is typical of obfuscated malicious scripts. The code reads and processes requirements files and a version string, but the obfuscation makes it difficult to determine its exact purpose. Such techniques are often used to hide malicious behavior, such as downloading or executing malicious payloads, exfiltrating data, or compromising the system. The presence of obfuscated code, unusual import statements, and the lack of clear, legitimate functionality strongly suggest malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that perform encryption, decryption, key management, and YAML data manipulation, but several functions are designed to process data in a way that suggests obfuscation and potential malicious intent. Notably, the function `DwedpEjlDzXSmOooaxaEhdoSTEcsAKfF` decrypts data with a provided public key and then prints the decrypted content, which could be used to exfiltrate or reveal sensitive information. Additionally, the code includes functions for encrypting data with a public key and replacing secrets within data structures, indicating possible secret key or credential management. The presence of obfuscated variable names, custom YAML constructors for encrypted data, and functions that handle sensitive cryptographic operations strongly suggest that this code is intended for malicious purposes such as secret extraction, data exfiltration, or covert communication. Overall, the code appears to be designed to operate stealthily, manipulate encrypted data, and potentially leak sensitive information, classifying it as malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a command-line interface (CLI) tool that performs cryptographic operations related to key generation, encryption, decryption, and secret management. While these functions themselves are not inherently malicious, the obfuscated function names, the presence of private key handling, and the overall structure suggest it could be used for malicious purposes such as covertly managing encrypted secrets, generating private keys, or exfiltrating sensitive data. The code's design, including prompts for secrets and private keys, and the potential to re-encrypt secrets with new keys, indicates it could be used to manipulate or extract confidential information stealthily. Without additional context or the implementation details of imported functions, this code's behavior is suspicious and potentially malicious, especially if used without proper authorization or in a malicious context.",
