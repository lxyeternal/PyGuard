      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains functions that generate and display various Vega-Lite charts using the Streamlit library, with some functions constructing chart configurations that include potentially harmful or deceptive elements. Notably, certain functions embed obfuscated or dynamically generated rule and tooltip configurations, which could be used to manipulate or mislead users by hiding malicious intent behind complex, opaque chart setups. The code also includes functions with suspiciously obfuscated variable names and dynamic data transformations, suggesting an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears designed to produce visualizations that could be used for malicious purposes such as data deception, user manipulation, or covert data exfiltration, indicating malicious intent.",
