      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to establish a connection to a Metasploit RPC server, create a console session, and then run a Flask web server that accepts file uploads via a PUT request. The uploaded files are saved temporarily and then imported into the Metasploit database using the 'db_import' command. This setup suggests the code is designed to remotely upload and import files (likely malicious payloads or exploits) into a Metasploit environment, potentially for malicious exploitation or command and control purposes. The combination of remote code execution, file handling, and integration with Metasploit indicates malicious intent, especially if used without authorization.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to exfiltrate or misuse sensitive credentials. It retrieves environment variables 'MSFRPC_PASSWORD', 'MSFRPC_USERNAME', and optionally 'MSFRPC_HOSTNAME', which are likely credentials for a Metasploit RPC server. It then calls a function (imported from a local module) with these credentials, potentially to establish unauthorized access or control over a system. The obfuscated variable names and reliance on environment variables suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, possibly for remote command execution or data theft.",
