      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to read a file specified by the input parameter and searches for the string 'print' within its contents. If such a string is found, it prints a warning message in red, pauses execution for 1 second, and then terminates the program. This behavior suggests an attempt to detect or interfere with certain scripts or code that contain 'print' statements, potentially as a way to identify or disrupt specific code execution. Additionally, the code's obfuscated variable names and the use of an exception handler that changes the working directory to the user's home directory and prints a message indicate malicious intent to hide its true purpose or to interfere with normal operation. Overall, this code exhibits malicious behavior by monitoring file contents for specific strings and then terminating execution, which could be part of a larger malicious strategy to prevent certain scripts from running or to detect debugging or logging activities.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious intent, including functions that generate random phone numbers and device identifiers, which are often used for impersonation or evading detection. It also includes functions that interact with Facebook's mobile basic site to automate actions such as following a profile, which can be used for malicious social engineering, spam, or account hijacking. Additionally, the code attempts to install numerous packages dynamically, possibly to ensure required modules are available for malicious operations. The presence of obfuscated variable names, base64 decoding, and functions that generate fake device info strongly suggest an intent to perform automated, potentially harmful activities such as account manipulation, data harvesting, or unauthorized access. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts designed to exploit social media platforms or perform unauthorized automation.",
