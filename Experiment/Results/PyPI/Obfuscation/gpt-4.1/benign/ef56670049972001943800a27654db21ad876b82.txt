The functions handle sensitive data such as client IDs, secrets, and database credentials, and perform operations like retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting 'syncer' records. The obfuscated class and method names, combined with the use of requests to external endpoints and handling of potentially sensitive data, suggest this code could be part of a malicious data exfiltration or remote control mechanism.

The functions send sensitive payment-related data, potentially including personal information, to external servers. This pattern suggests malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or unauthorized payment processing.
