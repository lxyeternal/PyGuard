      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions that serialize and deserialize callable objects and binary data using base64 encoding and pickle, with obfuscated function names. Specifically, functions like rLCWBiknJzrJZlADkdSyawRZlaywJYFF and RxeFEiHCkDCsQQRfZvXBUgXTYJQEktgr are designed to encode callables and objects into base64 strings, and decode them back. This pattern is often used in malicious scripts to reconstruct and execute arbitrary code or payloads received from untrusted sources, effectively enabling remote code execution. The obfuscation of function names and the use of pickle serialization for callables strongly suggest an intent to hide malicious behavior, such as executing malicious payloads or commands dynamically, which is characteristic of malicious or backdoor code.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated and complex serialization/deserialization mechanisms, custom classes, and functions that appear designed to hide or manipulate data in non-standard ways. Notably, the presence of functions that handle JSON encoding/decoding with custom hooks, dynamic object creation, and the use of non-descriptive, randomized class and method names suggest an attempt to evade detection or analysis. Additionally, the code's structure and the use of functions like 'znrZWIydsFNbKlVqEjNiYHQnDzCgULwg' for float conversion and 'AwPHApMOrcSDFRmHlCUkjfvJboBxQdwT' for int conversion, combined with custom object wrappers, indicate potential for covert data handling or command-and-control communication. The overall design and obfuscation strongly suggest malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or malware payload delivery, especially given the lack of clear, legitimate functionality and the suspicious complexity.",

The obfuscated class and function names, along with the import of a module named 'RestResponse' and usage of functions like 'xXrgrrPqnxoTXXWaNSCVUZXcqmwfPkpJ', suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The deserialization process could be exploited to execute malicious code or exfiltrate data when data is retrieved from the database. Overall, the obfuscation, combined with the potential for data manipulation or hidden payloads, indicates malicious behavior.",
