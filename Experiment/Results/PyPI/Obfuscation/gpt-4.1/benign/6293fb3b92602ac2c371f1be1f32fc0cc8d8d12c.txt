      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a deliberately obfuscated or malformed setup script that imports a non-standard module 'overload' and references an unusual, nonsensical class name 'RoweayNEucGpQcfvJppMFoMyXwvkmmvD'. The presence of such obfuscated identifiers and the unusual import suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Additionally, the code does not perform any meaningful setup operations and includes a malformed argument 'aTVMXbufoFnnjaFbldGxlBeaecEOMKMO', which resembles obfuscated or encrypted data. This pattern is characteristic of malicious scripts designed to evade detection, potentially to execute malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or compromise the system once executed. Therefore, this code is likely malicious.",
