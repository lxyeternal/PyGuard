      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a stealthy WebSocket client that connects to a remote server via a proxy, maintains persistent communication, and handles specific actions such as 'AUTH' and 'PONG'. The use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic proxy setup, and continuous connection management suggest an intent to operate covertly. Such behavior is characteristic of malware or botnet clients designed to establish persistent command-and-control channels, potentially for malicious activities like data exfiltration, remote command execution, or participation in malicious botnets. The code's structure and behavior strongly indicate malicious intent, especially given its ability to connect through proxies, handle custom protocol messages, and run indefinitely with minimal oversight.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a bot or automated client that logs into a service (likely a platform called 'getgrass.io') using provided credentials or user IDs, then establishes WebSocket connections and spawns multiple asynchronous tasks. The presence of obfuscated class and variable names, combined with the behavior of repeatedly creating tasks and maintaining persistent connections, suggests it is designed for automated, possibly malicious, activity such as spamming, data scraping, or unauthorized automation. The code's structure and lack of clear legitimate purpose, along with its obfuscation, indicate it is likely malicious or at least intended for malicious automation.",
