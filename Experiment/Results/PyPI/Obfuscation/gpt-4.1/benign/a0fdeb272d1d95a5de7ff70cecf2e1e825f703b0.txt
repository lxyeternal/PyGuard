      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a complex, interactive environment for executing code blocks with user prompts, environment variable management, and retry mechanisms. The obfuscated import statements and class/method names suggest an attempt to hide its true purpose. The presence of functions that modify environment variables, handle secrets, and execute code blocks with user interaction indicates potential malicious intent, such as exfiltrating environment variables or secrets, executing arbitrary code, or controlling the environment in a way that could compromise system security. The code's structure and obfuscation are typical of malicious scripts designed to evade detection while performing harmful actions.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains functions and classes that facilitate executing arbitrary code, managing subprocesses, and potentially executing code snippets with controlled or uncontrolled input. Notably, the class `hTlcOyThVnmfKyugdMfHOKkjpTOUUORA` manages subprocesses, executes code, and captures output, which can be exploited to run malicious commands or code. The presence of obfuscated import statements, dynamic code execution, and process control strongly suggests malicious intent, such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or covert command execution. Additionally, the code's structure and naming conventions appear intentionally obfuscated, further indicating malicious behavior.",
