      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to implement complex signal processing functions involving wavelet transforms, coherence, and statistical significance calculations. However, several indicators suggest malicious intent:\n\n- The code contains obfuscated variable and function names, making it difficult to understand its purpose.\n- It loads and saves data from files with a '.gz' extension in a cache directory, which could be used to store or retrieve malicious payloads or exfiltration data.\n- The functions perform heavy numerical computations, possibly to mask data exfiltration or covert channels.\n- The presence of functions that load data from files and the use of 'try-except' blocks to handle missing files could be exploited to execute hidden or malicious code.\n- The code does not include any clear benign purpose, and the obfuscation, combined with file I/O operations and complex calculations, is characteristic of malicious or covert data exfiltration scripts.\n\nOverall, the code exhibits behaviors typical of malicious scripts designed to hide their true intent through obfuscation, cache data, and perform complex computations that could be used for covert communication or data theft.",

It loads data from files, performs multiple mathematical operations, and generates complex visualizations, but there is no clear legitimate purpose or meaningful data analysis. The code does not perform any obvious benign function and seems designed to mask malicious intent. Such obfuscation and unnecessary complexity are common tactics in malicious scripts to hide malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoor access, or executing hidden payloads.
