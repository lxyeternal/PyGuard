      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a malicious Python setup script that obfuscates its intent by using nonsensical or random package names and variable names. It imports a module named 'adminfilters' to retrieve its version, which could be a legitimate module or a maliciously embedded one. The key concern is the package name 'ys377skz8lklujhp', which is a random string, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent or to evade detection. Such obfuscation and the use of random identifiers are common tactics in malicious scripts designed to conceal their true purpose, potentially to install or execute harmful payloads during installation or runtime. Therefore, this code is likely malicious, aiming to disguise malicious behavior under the guise of a setup script.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be a heavily obfuscated Django admin extension that manipulates admin filters and change lists. The obfuscation (randomized class and method names) is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. While the code itself does not explicitly perform harmful actions like data exfiltration or system modification, its structure suggests it could be used to inject or modify admin interface behavior maliciously. For example, it may be designed to intercept or alter data displayed in the admin panel, potentially hiding malicious activities or exfiltrating sensitive data through hidden or disguised methods. The obfuscation and the way it extends core Django admin classes indicate an intent to embed malicious logic stealthily. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious or at least suspicious, warranting further investigation.",
