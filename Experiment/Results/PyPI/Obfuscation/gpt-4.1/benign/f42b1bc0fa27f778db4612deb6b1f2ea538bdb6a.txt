      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to execute an external command or script named 'bauplan-cli' located in the same directory as the script. It sets up signal handlers to forward SIGINT and SIGTERM signals to the child process, which suggests it is intended to run a subprocess and potentially control or terminate it remotely or in response to system signals. This behavior can be used maliciously to hide activity, execute arbitrary commands, or maintain persistence. The obfuscated class and function names further indicate an attempt to conceal its true purpose. Overall, this code can be used as part of a malicious payload to execute arbitrary code and respond to signals in a way that could disrupt or control system behavior, making it malicious.",
