      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a remote terminal server that creates a pseudo-terminal (PTY) process running a command shell (defaulting to 'cmd.exe') and facilitates bidirectional communication over WebSocket connections. It captures input from WebSocket clients and writes it to the PTY, while reading output from the PTY and broadcasting it to all connected clients. This setup effectively allows remote control of a command shell, which can be exploited for malicious purposes such as unauthorized remote access, command execution, or data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable names and the use of a PTY to spawn a command shell are common indicators of malicious remote access tools or backdoors.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a remote terminal server that forks a shell process (bash) and establishes WebSocket communication channels to interact with it. It allows clients to send commands and receive output, effectively exposing a remote shell interface. This setup can be exploited for unauthorized remote access, command execution, and control over the host system. The code's obfuscated class and variable names, combined with its ability to spawn a shell and communicate over WebSockets, strongly suggest malicious intent, such as creating a backdoor or remote administration tool for malicious purposes.",
