      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits several indicators of malicious intent. It processes images and embedded data in a way that suggests it is designed to extract, decode, and potentially execute or manipulate embedded or external content covertly. Specifically, it searches for embedded base64-encoded images and HTML tags containing 'src' attributes with embedded or external URLs, then fetches external resources via HTTP requests. The code also manipulates image orientation and resizes images, which could be used to evade detection or prepare payloads. The obfuscated variable names, use of regex to parse embedded data, and the handling of external content strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at covert data exfiltration, payload injection, or exploitation. Overall, the code appears to be crafted for malicious purposes, such as extracting hidden data, downloading malicious payloads, or manipulating images for malicious use.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code defines multiple classes with obfuscated names, all inheriting from a custom exception class. The base exception class contains a class variable set to zero, which is then overridden in subclasses with values from 4 to 17. This pattern suggests an attempt to obfuscate or hide malicious intent, possibly to be used as part of a larger exploit or to evade detection. The code itself does not perform any direct malicious actions such as network communication, file manipulation, or code execution. However, the obfuscation, inheritance from a custom exception, and the presence of numerous classes with sequentially numbered class variables strongly indicate that this code is designed to be part of a malicious payload or to facilitate malicious behavior elsewhere in a larger codebase. It may be used to trigger specific exception handling routines, or to serve as a covert marker or payload component, which is a common tactic in malicious scripts to evade detection and analysis.",
