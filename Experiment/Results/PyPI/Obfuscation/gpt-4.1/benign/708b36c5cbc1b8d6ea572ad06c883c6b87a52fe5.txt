      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be obfuscated and manipulates module imports in a way that suggests malicious intent. It attempts to dynamically load and replace the 'IMServicePlugIn' module with a lazy-loaded Objective-C module linked to the 'GameKit' framework, which is unrelated to the original plugin. Additionally, it deletes certain entries from 'sys.modules', potentially to hide its tracks or prevent detection. The obfuscation, dynamic module manipulation, and removal of module references are common techniques used in malicious scripts to conceal their true purpose and evade analysis. Overall, these behaviors indicate malicious intent, likely aiming to hijack or hide malicious functionality within legitimate-looking modules.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated script that manipulates Objective-C runtime metadata, registers numerous method signatures, and creates or updates internal data structures related to messaging, chat rooms, and user interactions. The obfuscation, combined with the registration of methods that handle sensitive actions such as accepting or declining authorization requests, sending messages, joining or leaving chat rooms, and updating account settings, suggests an intent to intercept, monitor, or manipulate messaging activities. The code does not perform any transparent or benign operations; instead, it seems designed to embed itself into a messaging application's internal mechanisms, potentially enabling unauthorized data access, eavesdropping, or control over user communications. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code aimed at surreptitious data collection or hijacking messaging functionalities.",
