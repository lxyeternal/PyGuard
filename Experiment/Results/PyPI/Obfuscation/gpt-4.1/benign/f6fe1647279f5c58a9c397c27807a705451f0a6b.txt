      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be designed to facilitate unauthorized or covert financial transactions using the 'nillion' blockchain platform. It includes functions to request price quotes, create and broadcast payment transactions, and handle payment receipts. The presence of functions that automate payment creation and submission, combined with obfuscated variable names, suggests an intent to hide malicious activity such as illicit fund transfers or unauthorized payments. Additionally, the code does not include any user prompts or safeguards, indicating it may operate silently or covertly. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts aimed at executing unauthorized financial operations.",
