      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains multiple indicators of malicious intent. It appears to be a heavily obfuscated and complex script that performs training and evaluation of machine learning models, including deep neural networks, with the capability to load and save model states, perform hyperparameter tuning, and generate detailed performance reports. Notably, it includes functions that load pre-trained models from disk ('model_k{k}.pt', 'final_model.pt') and then evaluate or continue training them, which could be exploited to load maliciously tampered models. The code also writes parameters and results to files and generates plots, which could be used to exfiltrate data or mask malicious activities. The obfuscation, combined with the ability to load arbitrary models and data, suggests potential for malicious use such as model theft, data exfiltration, or executing hidden payloads during model inference or training. Overall, the code's complexity, obfuscation, and file operations strongly indicate malicious behavior or at least a high risk of misuse.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains several indicators of malicious intent. It appears to perform data processing and visualization on neuroimaging (NIRS) data, but it also includes obfuscated and nonsensical variable names, redundant or confusing function calls, and potentially harmful operations such as dropping data segments ('drop_bad') without clear justification. The code's structure suggests it may be designed to manipulate or extract sensitive data covertly, especially given the obfuscation and the lack of clear purpose. Additionally, the code prints data shapes and channel information, which could be used for reconnaissance or data exfiltration. Overall, these characteristics strongly suggest malicious behavior aimed at covert data extraction or manipulation, rather than legitimate analysis.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be a heavily obfuscated script that processes neuroimaging (likely fNIRS) data, but it contains suspicious elements such as print statements referencing undefined variables ('event_to_label' and 'subj_to_group') which would cause runtime errors. More concerningly, the code's structure and variable naming suggest it may be designed to hide malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or executing hidden payloads, especially since it involves copying, cropping, and reshaping large datasets without clear purpose. The obfuscation and lack of transparency, combined with the potential for misuse of sensitive data, indicate malicious behavior, possibly aimed at covertly extracting or manipulating user data or system information under the guise of data processing.",
