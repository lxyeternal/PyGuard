      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to perform unauthorized logging and data exfiltration activities. It initializes logging handlers that send log data to external AWS CloudWatch log groups with parameters like 'truncate' and 'split', which suggest manipulation of log data. The code reads message content from files ('test/message_256.txt' and 'test/message_257.txt') and logs their contents, including within exception handling blocks. This pattern indicates an attempt to collect, process, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive information via external cloud services. The repeated setup of logging handlers and reading of message files, combined with the use of external cloudwatch modules, suggests malicious intent to covertly transmit data or monitor activities without user consent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom logging handler that sends log messages to an AWS CloudWatch Logs log group and stream. It includes obfuscated variable names and imports, which are common tactics to hide malicious intent. The handler can split, truncate, or error on messages that are too large, potentially allowing it to exfiltrate data covertly or flood a target system with logs. The use of random and timestamp-based identifiers for log streams, along with exception handling that retries or creates resources, suggests it may be used to persistently and stealthily transmit data. Overall, this code appears designed to covertly exfiltrate information via AWS CloudWatch, which is a common malicious behavior.",
