      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to implement a sophisticated HTTP request handler with features such as request customization, proxy management, cookie persistence, and dynamic user-agent handling. While these features can be used legitimately, the code's structure and obfuscated class and method names suggest an intent to conceal malicious activity. The presence of functions that download multiple files, manage cookies, and dynamically generate proxies and user agents indicates potential for covert data exfiltration, session hijacking, or automated malicious web interactions. The code's design allows it to perform stealthy web requests, possibly to scrape or attack target sites, or to maintain persistent, hidden sessions with malicious intent. Overall, the code's obfuscation, combined with its capabilities for stealthy network interactions, strongly suggests malicious behavior.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated Python class that wraps around a request-handling object imported from a local module. It defines numerous methods with nonsensical or randomized names, which internally invoke methods on the request object, passing in parameters that are either randomly generated, hardcoded, or derived from class methods. The obfuscation and complexity suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. The pattern of wrapping request calls with randomized or manipulated parameters, combined with the use of obfuscated method and variable names, indicates potential malicious behavior such as covert data exfiltration, command and control communication, or unauthorized network activity. The code's structure and obfuscation are typical of malware designed to evade detection and analysis, making it highly suspicious and likely malicious.",
