      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a custom decoding mechanism that reads a stream of bytes and reconstructs a large integer value using a variable-length encoding similar to varint. The presence of functions that read from streams, process bytes, and assemble potentially large integers suggests it could be used to decode or extract hidden or obfuscated data, such as payloads or commands. This pattern is often associated with malicious activities like decoding embedded payloads, exfiltrating data, or executing obfuscated code. The code itself does not perform any explicit harmful actions directly, but its structure and behavior are characteristic of malicious or obfuscated scripts designed to hide their true intent, making it potentially malicious.",
