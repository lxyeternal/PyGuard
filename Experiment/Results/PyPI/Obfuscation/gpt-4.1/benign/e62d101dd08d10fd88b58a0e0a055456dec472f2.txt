      "malicious_behavior": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated or intentionally malformed setup script that uses nonsensical parameter names and values, which do not conform to standard Python packaging practices. The parameter 'MePIHModdOBbMnNuRGfGrfckXkpeMMCu' is not a recognized argument for setuptools.setup(), and the list assigned to 'GqodTirwegGeUNVlkibDalUmMQMnQaZR' is improperly formatted and likely intended to obfuscate malicious intent. Such irregularities suggest an attempt to hide malicious behavior, such as executing hidden code, downloading malware, or establishing backdoors during installation. Overall, this code is suspicious and potentially malicious, designed to deceive or exploit the package installation process.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code appears to be designed for extracting and potentially exfiltrating sensitive information from files or variables. It includes functions that read the current script's source code, search for specific strings within files, and parse variable assignments from code or files. The function GFAOiLPMatglVozluEcKXcTnhREOuiok, in particular, searches for variable definitions that match a given name and extracts their assigned values, which could be used to locate and retrieve sensitive data such as credentials or secrets. The obfuscated variable names and the ability to specify filenames or variable lists suggest an intent to hide malicious intent or to operate stealthily. Overall, these behaviors are characteristic of malicious scripts aimed at data reconnaissance or exfiltration, indicating that the code is malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains functions that facilitate dynamic code inspection, reflection, and potentially malicious code execution. Specifically, the function `sqzJxxXXtCIIWwZJeurZbnutCohSyMyx` reads and parses a Python file, then collects all nodes of a certain type (`MePIHModdOBbMnNuRGfGrfckXkpeMMCu`) from its AST. The purpose of this is unclear and could be used to identify or extract specific code constructs, possibly for malicious analysis or manipulation. Additionally, the code imports and manipulates internal Python functions and modules in a way that suggests obfuscation or concealment of intent. The overall pattern indicates an intent to analyze, inspect, or potentially modify code dynamically, which is a common technique in malicious scripts aiming to evade detection or perform covert operations.",
