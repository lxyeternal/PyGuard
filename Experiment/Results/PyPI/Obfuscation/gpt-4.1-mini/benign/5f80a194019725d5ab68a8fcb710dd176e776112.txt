      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a suspiciously named function 'mgMioISEOChlvFRZiayfbaCEJMkWsoYT' from a non-standard module 'pivotr.pivotr', which is highly obfuscated and indicative of an attempt to hide its true purpose. The main script modifies sys.argv[0] to remove typical script or executable suffixes, likely to evade detection or analysis. It then immediately calls the imported function and exits with its return code. Without the source code of the imported function, the exact behavior cannot be fully determined, but the obfuscation, unusual naming, and manipulation of command-line arguments strongly suggest malicious intent, such as executing hidden payloads, performing unauthorized actions, or evading security mechanisms.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code implements functionality to establish SSH connections through multiple nodes, effectively creating SSH tunnels or pivoting through intermediate hosts. It uses the Paramiko library to automate SSH connections, including authentication via password or private key files, and supports forwarding TCP connections through chained SSH sessions. The code also includes functions to transfer files to/from remote hosts using SCP and to execute arbitrary commands remotely. Additionally, it provides an interactive SSH shell session through the chained connections. This behavior is characteristic of a network pivoting or tunneling tool, which can be used to bypass network restrictions and access internal or protected systems without authorization. Such capabilities are commonly employed in advanced persistent threats (APTs), lateral movement in compromised networks, or unauthorized data exfiltration. The obfuscated function and variable names suggest an attempt to hide the code's true purpose, which is a common trait in malicious software. Therefore, this code is malicious as it facilitates unauthorized access, stealthy network pivoting, and potential data theft or system compromise.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code performs network reconnaissance and host discovery activities that are typical of malicious lateral movement or network mapping tools used in cyber attacks. Specifically, it enumerates local network interfaces and IP addresses, calculates subnet ranges, and performs host discovery by pinging IP addresses within those subnets. It also uses SSH connections to remote nodes to execute commands (e.g., 'ip addr' and remote ping commands) to gather network information from those nodes. The code appears to recursively discover new hosts and add them as nodes, potentially building a network map for further exploitation. Such behavior is consistent with network pivoting or internal reconnaissance often used by attackers to identify reachable hosts and expand their foothold within a compromised network. The obfuscated variable and function names suggest an attempt to evade detection or analysis. Overall, this code is malicious as it facilitates unauthorized network scanning, host discovery, and lateral movement within a network, which can lead to further compromise and data exfiltration.",
