      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to detect if the file it reads contains the string 'print'. If it finds 'print' in any line, it prints a warning message in red color: 'DO NOR TRY TO Change' (likely a typo for 'DO NOT TRY TO Change'), then attempts to call a sleep function from an undefined module 'MoGcnURGIZQWvXJdGrYSYafRQtnrEUNp' and exits immediately. This behavior is designed to prevent or discourage modification or inspection of the code by detecting the presence of 'print' statements, which are commonly used for debugging or code analysis. The obfuscated function and variable names, combined with the anti-tampering mechanism, indicate an intent to hinder code analysis or modification, which is a common trait in malicious or protected code. Additionally, the except block runs 'cd $HOME' via os.system (which has no effect on the Python process) and then prints a message and exits, possibly to handle errors silently and prevent further inspection. Overall, this code acts as an anti-debugging or anti-tampering mechanism, which can be considered malicious behavior as it aims to prevent analysis or modification.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to install various Python packages dynamically using pip via os.system calls, including some standard libraries which are not installable via pip (e.g., string, random, sys), indicating obfuscation or attempts to confuse analysis. The code imports a module from a relative path with an obfuscated name, which could contain hidden malicious payloads. It executes a 'git pull' command, which can update the codebase from a remote repository without user consent, potentially introducing malicious updates. The code contains functions that generate randomized user-agent strings and device identifiers, which are typical in scripts designed to mimic legitimate traffic or evade detection. It uses HTTP requests and HTML parsing to interact with Facebook's mobile site, including actions like following a profile automatically using provided cookies, which suggests unauthorized account manipulation or automation. The code also attempts to uninstall and reinstall critical networking packages (requests and dependencies), possibly to ensure a specific environment or to remove security patches. The obfuscated variable names and the presence of base64 encoding/decoding functions further indicate attempts to hide the true intent. Overall, the code is designed to perform unauthorized actions on Facebook accounts, manipulate HTTP sessions, and update itself covertly, which constitutes malicious behavior.",
