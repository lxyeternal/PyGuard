      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code snippet only imports three objects from a local module named 'contour_compute' and then deletes the module reference. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as code execution, data exfiltration, obfuscation, or other suspicious activities in this snippet alone. However, the imported names are obfuscated and the module is deleted immediately after import, which is unusual and could be an attempt to hide behavior. Without the content of 'contour_compute' or the imported objects, it is not possible to definitively determine if the overall behavior is malicious. Based solely on this snippet, no malicious behavior is evident.",
