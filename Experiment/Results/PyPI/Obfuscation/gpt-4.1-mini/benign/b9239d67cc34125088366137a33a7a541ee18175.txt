      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'bootstrap' and defines a function 'clear' that takes arbitrary keyword arguments. Inside the function, it calls 'bootstrap.CdeNdUHRsTDjCRTbnlAnDXTIzEeQXcMG' with these arguments, presumably to initialize or retrieve some object. It then accesses a 'redis_conn' object from the returned dictionary, iterates over all keys in this Redis connection, and deletes each key, effectively wiping all data stored in the Redis database. Finally, it calls 'bootstrap.SDZDBBJcibujXWPPUTJUZxMTNCJTMAPN' with the same arguments, which could perform further actions. The obfuscated variable names and the complete deletion of all Redis keys indicate malicious intent, as it can cause data loss or disruption of services relying on Redis. This behavior is destructive and can be used to sabotage systems or erase critical data without authorization.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code loads a pickled file from disk using pickle.load, which is inherently unsafe if the pickle file is attacker-controlled, as it can execute arbitrary code during unpickling. After loading, it iterates over the loaded data and calls the redis 'restore' command with parameters extracted from the pickle data. This can be used to inject arbitrary keys and values into a Redis database, potentially overwriting or injecting malicious data. The obfuscated variable names and the use of pickle loading combined with Redis restore calls strongly indicate an attempt to stealthily restore or inject data into Redis, which can be used for persistence, data manipulation, or further exploitation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior related to unsafe deserialization and unauthorized data injection into Redis.",
