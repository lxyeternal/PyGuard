      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the output of os.uname (system identification), the user's home directory path, and the current working directory. It then serializes this information into JSON, encodes it in base64, and sends it as a query parameter in an HTTP request to an external URL (https://pypi.org/reqs?d=...) with a spoofed Host header ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration or telemetry collection without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable names and the sending of potentially sensitive system information to an external server can be considered malicious, as it may compromise user privacy and security.",
