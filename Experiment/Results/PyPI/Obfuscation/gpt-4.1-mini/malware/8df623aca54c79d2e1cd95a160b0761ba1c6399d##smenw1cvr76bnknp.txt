      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a hidden directory named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' which mimics a Windows system folder to avoid suspicion. It then downloads an executable file named 'main.exe' from a Discord CDN URL and saves it into this hidden directory under the name 'XMICNEI.exe'. Finally, it executes this downloaded file using os.startfile. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable on the victim's machine without user consent. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious actions such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or damaging the system.",
