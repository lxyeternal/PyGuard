      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains malicious behavior primarily focused on Discord account token abuse and data exfiltration. The function GQnZWaPfwUmQMMYlEubaNjXwMcPxIIPD(auth) uses a Discord authorization token to access sensitive user information via Discord's API, including username, user ID, email, phone number, friends list, servers, and direct message channels. It then prints this information locally but also sends it to an external webhook URL (decoded from base64) via the function hNGMlOXNuQXCnQIAEaNOAFSizedtiXAe. This webhook is hosted on a third-party service (ptb.discordapp.com) and is used to exfiltrate the victim's Discord account details without consent. The code also fetches billing information from another external API endpoint and includes it in the exfiltrated data. The obfuscation of variable names and base64 encoding of URLs is a common tactic to evade detection. Additionally, the code contains a function (fEpCFlOyJZBtalZdHtuDdxFreQOVyvMQ) that appears to perform a UDP flood attack by sending packets repeatedly to a target IP and port, which is a form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack. The presence of this function indicates potential use for network attacks. Overall, the code is designed to steal Discord user credentials and personal information and possibly perform network attacks, making it malicious.",
