      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function RfuUONpDDXtUbVhTweGGBUUWfVMZrAvk that performs the following malicious actions: it detects the operating system of the host machine, then downloads a text file from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt). It parses this file to find lines containing the OS name, and treats these lines as filenames. For each such filename, it attempts to download a corresponding file from the same remote server. It writes the downloaded content to disk, sets executable permissions if on Linux or macOS, and then executes the downloaded file in the background. This behavior effectively allows the remote server to deliver and execute arbitrary binaries on the victim machine, which is a classic pattern of a downloader or dropper malware. Additionally, the code overrides common HTTP method functions (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options) to call this malicious downloader function before performing their intended network requests, ensuring the malicious payload is deployed whenever these functions are used. The obfuscated variable and function names, the use of a hardcoded IP address, and the execution of remote code without user consent confirm the code is malicious and designed to compromise the host system.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports from a suspiciously named module 'frequest' which is not a standard or commonly known Python library. The imported names include 'get' and 'delete', which are common HTTP method names, but also several obfuscated and nonsensical identifiers (e.g., 'JGRLVNeaCQmskyOsNMgPNUNDjTMzUdjH'). This pattern is typical of malicious code attempting to hide its true functionality. The obfuscated names suggest that the code may be designed to perform unauthorized network requests, data exfiltration, or remote command execution. Without further code, the exact behavior cannot be pinpointed, but the use of an unknown module with obfuscated imports strongly indicates malicious intent.",
