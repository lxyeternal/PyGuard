      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of base64 decoding and string replacements to hide its true functionality. The code imports the base64 module, decodes a large base64-encoded string, performs a series of string replacements to further obfuscate the payload, and then executes the resulting code using exec(). This technique is commonly used to conceal malicious payloads and evade detection. The obfuscated payload likely contains code that performs unauthorized or harmful actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise. Due to the extreme obfuscation and dynamic execution, the code poses a significant security risk and should be treated as malicious.",
