      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 decoding, string encoding with escape sequences, and dynamic evaluation via eval. The code dynamically imports modules such as base64, codecs, and others, and defines functions that decode and transform data in complex ways. The final execution line decodes a large base64-encoded payload, processes it through custom decoding functions, and then executes it dynamically. This pattern is characteristic of malicious code designed to hide its true intent and evade detection. The obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest that the code likely downloads, decrypts, or executes hidden payloads, potentially leading to unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthy execution of harmful payloads.",
