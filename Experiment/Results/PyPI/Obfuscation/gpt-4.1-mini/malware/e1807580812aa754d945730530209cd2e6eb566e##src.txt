      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to steal a Roblox security cookie from the Windows registry and send it to a remote Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. Specifically, it accesses the registry key related to Roblox Studio, extracts the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie value, parses it, and then posts this sensitive authentication token to a Discord webhook URL. The stolen cookie can be used by an attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account or perform unauthorized actions on their behalf. This behavior constitutes clear malicious intent as it compromises user security and privacy.",
