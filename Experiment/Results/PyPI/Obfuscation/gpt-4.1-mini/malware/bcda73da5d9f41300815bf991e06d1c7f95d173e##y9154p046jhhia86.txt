      "malicious_behavior": "This code attempts to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers installed on the victim's machine (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera) using the 'browser_cookie3' library. It then sends these stolen cookies to a remote Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive session tokens. These cookies can be used by an attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account without needing the password. The code runs these extraction and exfiltration functions concurrently in separate threads to increase efficiency. The use of obfuscated variable names and silent exception handling (empty except blocks) further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this is a cookie stealer targeting Roblox accounts, which is malicious behavior aimed at account theft and unauthorized access.",
