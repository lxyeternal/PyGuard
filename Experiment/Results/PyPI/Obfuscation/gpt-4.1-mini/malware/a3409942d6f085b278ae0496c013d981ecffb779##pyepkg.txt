      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a specified URL, saves it to a randomly named directory inside the system's temporary directory, and then executes the downloaded file using subprocess.run. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware component, which fetches and runs potentially harmful executables or scripts from the internet without user consent. The obfuscated variable names and the use of temporary directories to hide the downloaded file further suggest an attempt to evade detection. The executed file could perform any malicious action, such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system.",
