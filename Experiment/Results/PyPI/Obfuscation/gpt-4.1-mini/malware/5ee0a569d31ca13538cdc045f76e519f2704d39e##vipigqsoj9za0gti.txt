      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It attempts to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from the victim's browser cookies across multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library. It then validates the stolen cookie to check if it is still valid. If valid, it uses the Roblox API and robloxpy library to gather detailed user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, RAP (Recent Average Price), account age, creation date, and profile images. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the stolen Roblox cookie, IP address, and detailed account data, is then sent to a remote Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account, potentially leading to account theft, unauthorized transactions, and privacy violations. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names to evade detection and uses direct OS commands and network requests to exfiltrate data. Overall, this script is a Roblox cookie stealer and account information harvester designed for malicious purposes.",
