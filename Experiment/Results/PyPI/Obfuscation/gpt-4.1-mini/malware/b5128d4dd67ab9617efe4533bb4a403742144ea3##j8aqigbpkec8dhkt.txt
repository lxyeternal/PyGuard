      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including the use of eval, base64 decoding, and custom decoding functions. It dynamically imports modules and functions by decoding strings at runtime, which is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. The code decodes and executes a large base64-encoded payload that is further decoded and transformed before execution. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoor scripts designed to evade detection by static analysis tools. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate that the code is intended to execute hidden or unauthorized actions, potentially compromising the system, stealing data, or executing arbitrary commands. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
