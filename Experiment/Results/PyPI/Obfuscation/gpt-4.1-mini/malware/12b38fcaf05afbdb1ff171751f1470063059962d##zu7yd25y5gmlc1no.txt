      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the hostname, current working directory, and the public IP address of the machine by querying external services. It then encodes this information into a hex string and constructs multiple DNS queries to a suspicious domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net'. This domain is likely controlled by an attacker or a third party. The DNS queries are used as a covert channel to exfiltrate sensitive information from the victim's machine without direct HTTP communication, which can evade some network monitoring tools. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of DNS resolution for data exfiltration are strong indicators of malicious intent. The final print statement attempts to mislead the user by claiming it is a security test and suggests reinstalling pip, which could be a social engineering tactic. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily gather and leak system information to an external attacker-controlled server, constituting malicious behavior.",
