      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 decoding, hex escapes, and dynamic evaluation via eval. It imports critical modules such as 'base64', 'codecs', 'exec', 'str.encode', and 'bytes', and defines functions that manipulate and decode data in complex ways. The code dynamically decodes a large base64-encoded and hex-encoded payload, then executes it. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code designed to hide its true intent and evade detection. The purpose of such obfuscation and dynamic execution is typically to run unauthorized or harmful operations, such as executing a payload that could compromise system security, steal data, or perform other malicious activities. Due to the obfuscation and the use of eval on decoded data, this code poses a significant security risk and should be treated as malicious.",
