      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is obfuscated and uses multiple layers of decoding and encoding to hide its true functionality. It dynamically imports modules and functions using eval and encoded strings, then defines functions that perform complex decoding operations on data. The code ultimately decodes a large base64-encoded and bz2-compressed payload, then executes it using the exec function. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code that attempts to conceal its payload and execute arbitrary code on the host system. The obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest it is designed to evade detection and analysis, potentially allowing it to perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or other harmful activities.",
