      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code uses multiple layers of obfuscation to hide its true functionality. It imports the 'marshal', 'zlib', and 'base64' modules dynamically and then decodes, decompresses, and unmarshals a large base64-encoded, reversed byte string. The resulting code is then executed with exec(). This technique is commonly used to conceal malicious payloads such as backdoors, trojans, or other harmful scripts. The heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis, which is typical behavior of malicious code. Without fully decoding and analyzing the payload, the obfuscation itself and the use of exec on decoded data is a red flag for malicious intent.",
