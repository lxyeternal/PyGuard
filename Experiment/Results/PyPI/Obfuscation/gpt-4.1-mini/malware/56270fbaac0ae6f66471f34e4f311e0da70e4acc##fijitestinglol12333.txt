      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to steal Discord authentication tokens from various installed applications on the victim's machine, including Discord, Discord Canary, Discord PTB, Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, and Yandex browsers. It searches through the local storage LevelDB files for patterns matching Discord tokens (both standard and MFA tokens). The collected tokens are then formatted and sent via a Discord webhook to a remote server controlled by the attacker. This behavior constitutes credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration, which can lead to account compromise, unauthorized access, and further malicious activities using the stolen tokens.",
