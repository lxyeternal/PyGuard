      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to download a file named '.drv' from a remote server (http://145.249.104.71/out) if the operating system is Linux. It saves this file in the user's home directory, sets the file as executable, and then modifies the user's .bashrc file to execute this downloaded file in the background every time a new shell session starts. This behavior is typical of malware or a persistent backdoor, as it ensures the downloaded payload runs automatically on each login, potentially allowing unauthorized access, data theft, or further system compromise. The obfuscation of variable names and the silent installation without user consent further indicate malicious intent.",
