It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.startfile. This behavior is typical of malware or potentially unwanted programs that fetch and run external executables without user consent. The downloaded executable could contain any form of malicious payload, such as ransomware, trojans, or spyware, posing a significant security risk to the system.",
