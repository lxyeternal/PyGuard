      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression to hide its true functionality. It imports modules commonly used for obfuscation (random, base64, codecs, zlib) and defines a lambda function that decodes a large sequence of numbers into characters, then executes the resulting code dynamically using eval and exec. The code also decompresses and base64-decodes a payload, which is then executed. This technique is typical of malicious scripts attempting to evade detection by hiding their payload and behavior. The use of dynamic execution (eval/exec) on decoded and decompressed data strongly indicates that the script is designed to run hidden or unauthorized code, which could be used for malicious purposes such as executing arbitrary commands, downloading malware, or compromising the host system. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
