      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily steal Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from the victim's browser by accessing cookies stored in multiple browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera). It then validates the stolen cookie to check if it is still valid. If valid, it uses the cookie to gather detailed user information from Roblox, including UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, RAP (Recent Average Price), creation date, and profile headshot. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the stolen cookie itself, is then sent via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook URL (stored in the variable DwJDwdxBlFQnLNDHKrsVCxQYiNcPSmLl). This effectively leaks the victim's Roblox account credentials and personal data to an attacker-controlled Discord channel. The code also contains obfuscated variable names and unnecessary complexity to hinder analysis. The purpose of this code is to compromise Roblox accounts by stealing authentication cookies and related user data, which can lead to unauthorized access, account theft, and potential financial loss for the victim.",
