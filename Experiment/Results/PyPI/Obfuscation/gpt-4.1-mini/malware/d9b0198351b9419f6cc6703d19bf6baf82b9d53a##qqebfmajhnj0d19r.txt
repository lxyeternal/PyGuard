      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious Discord token and credential stealer, commonly referred to as a 'stealer'. It performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. **Discord Token Theft:** It searches for Discord tokens stored in various local files related to Discord and Chromium-based browsers. It decrypts these tokens using Windows DPAPI and attempts to validate them by querying Discord's API.\n\n2. **Credential and Cookie Theft:** It extracts saved passwords and cookies from Chromium-based browsers by accessing their SQLite databases, decrypting stored credentials using the local encryption keys.\n\n3. **User Information Harvesting:** Using stolen Discord tokens, it queries Discord's API to gather user information such as username, email, phone number, badges, billing information, and friends list.\n\n4. **Data Exfiltration:** All stolen data (tokens, passwords, cookies, user info) is sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive user data to an attacker-controlled server.\n\n5. **File Searching and Uploading:** It searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files with keywords related to accounts, passwords, secrets, wallets, etc., uploads these files to a file hosting service, and sends links to the attacker.\n\n6. **Process Interference:** It kills certain processes (e.g., browsers) to access locked files for stealing data.\n\n7. **Obfuscation and Anti-Detection:** The code uses obfuscated variable names and multiple threads to evade detection and speed up data collection.\n\n**Potential Harm:** This code compromises user privacy and security by stealing authentication tokens, passwords, cookies, and sensitive files. It enables attackers to hijack Discord accounts, access personal and financial information, and potentially perform further malicious activities under the victim's identity.",
