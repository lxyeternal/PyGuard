      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on GitHub releases) and saves it to a hidden or less obvious location within the user's APPDATA\\Microsoft directory under the filename 'kekwltd.exe'. It then attempts to execute this downloaded file using a subprocess call with the 'start' command. This behavior is typical of malware or potentially unwanted programs that silently download and run external executables without user consent. The purpose is likely to install or run malicious software on the victim's machine, which could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, system compromise, or other harmful effects.",
