      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate its true functionality, which is a common technique to hide malicious payloads. The code imports the base64 module, decodes a large base64-encoded string, and executes it using exec(). The decoded payload is heavily obfuscated and appears to contain repetitive patterns and encoded data, which is typical of malware or backdoor scripts designed to evade detection. Such code can execute arbitrary commands, download additional malware, steal data, or compromise the system. The use of multiple layers of string replacements and the large encoded payload strongly indicate an attempt to conceal harmful actions. Therefore, this code should be treated as malicious and not executed.",
