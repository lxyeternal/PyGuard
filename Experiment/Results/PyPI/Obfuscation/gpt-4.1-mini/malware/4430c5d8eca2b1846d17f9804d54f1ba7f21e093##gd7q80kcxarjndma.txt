      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes a Python command into it that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/xnouv/raw) without any validation or user consent. It then runs this temporary file using a Python interpreter subprocess. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, which fetches and runs potentially harmful code from the internet. The remote code could perform any malicious actions such as data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The obfuscation of variable names and indirect execution further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
