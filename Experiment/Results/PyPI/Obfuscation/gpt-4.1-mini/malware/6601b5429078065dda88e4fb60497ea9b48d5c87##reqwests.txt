      "malicious_behavior": "The code establishes a TCP connection to a remote server at dzgi0h7on1jhzdg0vknw9pp9309rxjl8.oastify.com on port 10010. It then redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors (0, 1, 2) to this socket, effectively linking the local process's I/O to the remote server. After that, it decodes a base32-encoded string to obtain the string '/bin/sh' and executes it with the '-i' flag, which starts an interactive shell. This results in a reverse shell, allowing the remote server to execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine with the privileges of the running script. This behavior is malicious as it provides unauthorized remote access and control over the infected system.",
