      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 decoding, character code transformations, and dynamic evaluation via eval. It imports modules dynamically using obfuscated strings and decodes a large base64-encoded payload. The code then processes this payload through custom decoding functions and finally executes it. Such behavior is characteristic of malicious code designed to hide its true intent and evade detection. The use of eval on decoded data is particularly dangerous as it allows execution of arbitrary code, which could lead to unauthorized actions such as data theft, system compromise, or installation of malware. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate that the code is malicious.",
