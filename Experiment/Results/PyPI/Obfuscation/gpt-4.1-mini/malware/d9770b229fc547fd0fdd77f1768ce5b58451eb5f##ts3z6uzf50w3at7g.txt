      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes a Python snippet into it that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/9zyhb/raw) without any validation or user consent. Then, it launches a new Python interpreter process (using the 'w.exe' variant to likely suppress console windows) to run this downloaded code. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, as it fetches and executes potentially harmful code from an external source, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
