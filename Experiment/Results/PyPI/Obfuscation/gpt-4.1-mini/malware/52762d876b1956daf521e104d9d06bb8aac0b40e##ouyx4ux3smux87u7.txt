      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64, hex escapes, and dynamic evaluation of strings. It uses eval to dynamically reconstruct and execute code, which is a common technique in malicious scripts to evade detection. The code imports modules like base64, codecs, and bytes, and defines functions that decode and transform data in complex ways. The final executed payload is decoded from a base64-encoded and further encoded string, then processed through custom decoding functions before being executed. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that hide their true intent by obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The code likely executes hidden or unauthorized commands or payloads, potentially compromising the system it runs on. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a security risk.",
