      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the machine's nodename, the current user, the current working directory, and a hardcoded string resembling a package name/version. It encodes this information in base64, then further encodes it into hexadecimal chunks. The code then constructs domain names by appending these encoded chunks as subdomains to a suspicious domain (\"deliverycontent.online\"), and performs ping commands to these constructed domains. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration via DNS or ICMP requests, a common covert channel technique used by malware to leak information without raising suspicion. Additionally, the code attempts multiple HTTP requests (GET and POST) to the same suspicious domain, sending the encoded system information as parameters or payloads. The use of multiple HTTP libraries and fallback attempts suggests an effort to ensure data transmission regardless of environment. The obfuscation of variable names and the unusual encoding and transmission methods strongly indicate malicious intent, aiming to stealthily send system information to a remote server controlled by an attacker. This can lead to privacy breaches, system fingerprinting for further attacks, or serve as a reconnaissance step in a larger attack chain.",
