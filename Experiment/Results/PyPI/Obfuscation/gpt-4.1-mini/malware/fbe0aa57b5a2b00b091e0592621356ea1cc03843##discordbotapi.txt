      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior. It first installs a large number of Python packages, some of which are commonly used for system interaction, clipboard access, cryptography, and network communication (e.g., pyperclip, pycryptodome, win32gui, psutil, requests, httpx). The code then imports a wide range of modules related to system operations, Windows registry manipulation, cryptography, image grabbing, and process control. Most notably, it contains an obfuscated payload: a large gzip-compressed and marshal-serialized code blob that is decompressed and executed at runtime. This technique is commonly used to hide the true intent of the code and evade detection. The use of modules like win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData suggests attempts to access or decrypt sensitive Windows data, such as stored credentials or tokens. The presence of clipboard access (pyperclip), screen capture (PIL.ImageGrab), and network libraries (httpx, requests) indicates potential for data theft, keylogging, or exfiltration of information. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate that the code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions on the victim's machine, such as stealing sensitive data, spying on user activity, or establishing persistence. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
