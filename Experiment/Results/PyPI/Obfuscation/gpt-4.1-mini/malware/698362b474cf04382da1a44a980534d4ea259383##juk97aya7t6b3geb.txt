      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from the victim's web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera) using the browser_cookie3 library. It then validates the stolen cookie to check if it is still valid. If valid, it uses the cookie to gather detailed information about the victim's Roblox account, including UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, RAP (Recent Average Price), creation date, username, premium status, and profile images. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the stolen authentication cookie, is then sent via HTTP POST requests to a Discord webhook URL (stored in the variable KxFYjtMjKlXabHrSExMlKDaTSgtrSlGG). This behavior constitutes account credential theft and privacy invasion, enabling the attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account and potentially perform unauthorized actions or sell the account data. The code also prints the webhook response, indicating it expects successful data exfiltration. Overall, this is malicious code intended for stealing Roblox user credentials and sensitive account data without user consent.",
