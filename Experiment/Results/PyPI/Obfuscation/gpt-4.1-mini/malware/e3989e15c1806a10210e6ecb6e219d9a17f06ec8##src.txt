      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive sensitive information from the host system without user consent. It reads the entire contents of the /etc/passwd file, which contains user account information. It gathers all environment variables, lists files in the current directory, reads the contents of a local 'logger.py' file, and reads the /etc/hosts file. It also collects running process IDs and commands by executing 'ps' command, enumerates all files in the user's home directory, and attempts to list files under a '/rasp' directory. It collects system information such as the hostname, current working directory, and home directory path. All this collected data is serialized into JSON, base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP POST request to an external URL disguised as 'https://pypi.org/reqs?d=' but with a suspicious Host header 'psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'. This behavior is typical of spyware or data exfiltration malware designed to steal system information and potentially sensitive files, then transmit them to a remote attacker-controlled server. The obfuscated variable names and error-suppressing try-except blocks further indicate an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a privacy and security risk.",
