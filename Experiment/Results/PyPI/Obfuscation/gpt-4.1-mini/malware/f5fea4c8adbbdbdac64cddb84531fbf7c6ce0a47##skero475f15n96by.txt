      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated class and method names, which is a common tactic to evade detection. The class AtkCZHoggxjfmRukayUPXqWgkiDnxpcR has a method that sends HTTP POST requests to a specified webhook URL with a message payload. This behavior is typical of data exfiltration or unauthorized information sending to an external server, often used in malware to leak sensitive information. The second class, FmsoLLhVLPpzEnGqPZGGwpRFGdNKaOSk, uses the pymem library to interact with another process's memory, which can be used for process manipulation or injection, a technique often employed by malware to alter or control other processes. The obfuscation and the combination of network communication with process memory manipulation strongly indicate malicious intent.",
