      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding to hide its true functionality. It uses eval with encoded strings, base64 decoding, and dynamic execution of decoded content. The code constructs and executes a payload that is hidden inside a large base64-encoded and hex-escaped string. Such obfuscation techniques are typical of malicious code aiming to evade detection and analysis. The code likely executes hidden or unauthorized operations, potentially including downloading or executing further malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The exact payload is not trivially extractable without decoding the large encoded string, but the use of eval on decoded data and the obfuscation strongly indicate malicious intent.",
