      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'kekwltd.exe' from a remote URL (https://kekwltd.ru/kekwltd.exe) and saves it into the user's APPDATA\\Microsoft directory, which is a common location used by malware to hide files. After saving the file, it attempts to execute the downloaded executable using subprocess.call with the 'start' command. This behavior is typical of downloader or dropper malware that fetches and runs potentially harmful payloads without user consent. The obfuscated variable names and the use of a suspicious domain further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious activity, including but not limited to data theft, system compromise, or installing additional malware.",
