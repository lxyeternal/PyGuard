      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to download a file from a remote server (http://145.249.104.71/out) and save it locally as a hidden file named '.drv' in the user's home directory on Linux systems. It then changes the file's permissions to make it executable. Furthermore, it modifies the user's '.bashrc' file by appending a command to execute this downloaded file in the background every time a new shell session starts. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to establish persistence on the victim's machine by running a potentially harmful or unauthorized executable automatically. The downloaded file could contain malicious payloads such as backdoors, trojans, or other forms of malware. The code also suppresses execution on non-Linux systems by printing an error and exiting, indicating targeted malicious intent. Overall, this code is malicious as it downloads and installs a persistent executable from an untrusted source without user consent.",
