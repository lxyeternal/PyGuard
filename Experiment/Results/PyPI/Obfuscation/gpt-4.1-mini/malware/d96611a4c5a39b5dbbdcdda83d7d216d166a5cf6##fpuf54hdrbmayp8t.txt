      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed information about the host machine, including the hostname, current working directory, Python version, and IP addresses. It then encodes this information into a hex string, appends the Python version, and performs DNS queries to a suspicious domain (burpcollaborator.net) using a custom DNS resolver. This domain is commonly used in security testing and penetration testing tools to detect data exfiltration via DNS. The code effectively exfiltrates system information covertly by encoding it into DNS queries, which can bypass many network security controls. Additionally, the code attempts to retrieve the public IP address of the machine via external web services. The obfuscated variable names and the use of DNS queries for data exfiltration strongly indicate malicious intent, as this technique is often used by malware to stealthily leak sensitive information to an attacker-controlled server.",
