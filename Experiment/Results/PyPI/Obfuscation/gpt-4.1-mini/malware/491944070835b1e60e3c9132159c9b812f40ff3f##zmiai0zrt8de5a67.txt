      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to download and execute an executable file named 'colorfonts.exe' from an external URL (hosted on mediafire.com) without user consent. It uses the os.system call to run a shell command that changes the directory to C:/, downloads the file using curl with silent mode, saves it as 'colorfonts.exe', and then immediately executes it. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to fetch and run potentially harmful software on the victim's machine, which can lead to unauthorized access, data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities. The use of a try-except block that silently ignores any errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection or interruption.",
