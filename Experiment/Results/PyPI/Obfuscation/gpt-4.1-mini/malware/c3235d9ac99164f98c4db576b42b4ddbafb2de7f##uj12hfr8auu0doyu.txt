First, it sends a notification to a Discord webhook URL indicating that the package 'reverse_shell' has been installed, which suggests it is tracking or reporting installation events to a remote attacker-controlled server. Second, it clones a Git repository from 'https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git' into a local directory on the C: drive, which could be used to download additional malicious payloads or updates without user consent. Third, it changes the working directory to the cloned repository and executes a Python script named 'bypass.py' via subprocess, which likely contains further malicious code or actions. The obfuscated function and variable names, combined with the use of external network communication and execution of downloaded code, strongly indicate that this script is designed to perform unauthorized actions, potentially compromising the host system.",

Second, it clones a GitHub repository ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') into a local directory on the C: drive, which is unusual and potentially unauthorized behavior. Third, it changes the working directory to this cloned repository and executes a Python script named 'bypass.py' from it. This script is not provided, but the name 'bypass.py' implies it may be used to bypass security mechanisms or perform further malicious actions. The combination of remote notification, cloning external code, and executing it without user consent or transparency strongly indicates malicious intent, potentially enabling remote code execution, persistence, or further compromise of the system.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple signs of malicious behavior. First, it sends a notification to a Discord webhook URL when the package is installed, potentially alerting an attacker that the environment is compromised. Second, it clones a Git repository from 'https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git' into a local directory on the user's machine without explicit user consent. Third, it changes the working directory to this cloned repository and executes a Python script named 'bypass.py' from it. This behavior suggests that the code is designed to silently download and execute potentially harmful or unauthorized code on the victim's machine. The obfuscated function and variable names further indicate an attempt to hide its true purpose. Overall, this code acts as a downloader and remote notifier, which can be used to facilitate further malicious actions such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
