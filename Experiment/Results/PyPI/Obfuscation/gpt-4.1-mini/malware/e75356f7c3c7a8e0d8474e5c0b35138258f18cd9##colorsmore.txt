      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports everything from a relative module named 'colormore_file' and then calls a function or executes a callable named 'WWDhCDxhxorNobksJdUofTntdeqUboSM' which has a suspicious, obfuscated name. This kind of naming is typical in malicious code to evade detection and analysis. The code also imports 'colorama', a library for terminal text coloring, which is often used to disguise or prettify output, potentially to hide malicious activity or make it less obvious. Since the main action is a call to an obfuscated function from an unknown module, it is highly likely that this code executes hidden or harmful operations such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or other malicious payloads. Without the source of 'colormore_file', the exact behavior cannot be fully determined, but the obfuscation and structure strongly indicate malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive user data related to the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet from the victim's computer. It attempts to locate and compress wallet configuration and secret files (such as passphrase.json, seed.seco, twofactor-secret.seco, and others) from the user's AppData roaming directory into a zip archive. It also tries to include potentially interesting text files from Desktop, Downloads, and Documents folders. After gathering these files, the script retrieves the victim's public IP address and country code via an external API, appends this information to a message, and sends both the message and the zip archive to a remote attacker-controlled Telegram bot using the Telegram Bot API. This behavior constitutes data theft and exfiltration of sensitive cryptocurrency wallet information, which can lead to unauthorized access and theft of the victim's cryptocurrency assets. The code uses obfuscated variable names and attempts to clean up traces by deleting the zip file after sending. Overall, this is a malicious information-stealing script targeting cryptocurrency wallet data.",
