      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is malicious. It uses multiple layers of obfuscation to hide its true intent. Initially, it uses exec with a base64-decoded string, which itself contains another exec call. The decoded payload imports the 'requests' library and sends a POST request to a Discord webhook URL, transmitting sensitive data labeled as 'PRODTEST=password: @AZUREPTES-AUS'. This behavior indicates that the code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive information (likely credentials or tokens) to an external server controlled by an attacker. Such data leakage can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of the victim's environment. The use of cryptography and further decoding suggests attempts to evade detection and analysis.",
