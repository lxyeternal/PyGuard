      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera) on the victim's machine using the browser_cookie3 library. It then validates the stolen cookie to check if it is still valid. If valid, it uses the cookie to gather detailed information about the Roblox account, including UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, creation date, and profile images via the robloxpy API and Roblox web API. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the stolen .ROBLOSECURITY cookie, is then sent to a remote Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. This behavior constitutes account credential theft and exfiltration of private user data without consent, which is malicious and can lead to account takeover, financial loss, and privacy violations for the victim.",
