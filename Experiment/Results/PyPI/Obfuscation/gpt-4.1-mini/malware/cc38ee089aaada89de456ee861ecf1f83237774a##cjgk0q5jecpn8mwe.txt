      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'pics.exe' from a remote URL hosted on GitHub (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) and saves it locally. It then attempts to execute this downloaded file using subprocess.Popen. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, which fetches and runs potentially harmful executables from the internet without user consent. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious activity such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The obfuscated function and variable names suggest an attempt to evade detection or analysis.",
