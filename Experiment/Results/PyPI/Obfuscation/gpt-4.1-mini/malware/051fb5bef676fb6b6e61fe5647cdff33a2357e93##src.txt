      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code uses the 'pytransform' module and calls 'pyarmor_runtime()' followed by a call to '__pyarmor__' with a large byte string argument. This pattern is characteristic of code protected or obfuscated by PyArmor, a tool used to encrypt and obfuscate Python scripts to prevent reverse engineering. While PyArmor itself is a legitimate tool, the presence of such heavy obfuscation and encrypted payloads is a common technique used by malware authors to hide malicious code. Without decrypting the payload, it is impossible to determine the exact behavior, but the use of PyArmor obfuscation strongly suggests an intent to conceal potentially harmful or unauthorized actions. Therefore, this code is considered malicious or at least suspicious due to its obfuscation and encrypted content, which could hide backdoors, data exfiltration, or other harmful behaviors.",
