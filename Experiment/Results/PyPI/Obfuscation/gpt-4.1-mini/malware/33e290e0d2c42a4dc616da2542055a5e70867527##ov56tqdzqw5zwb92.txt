      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL hosted on Discord's CDN and saves it to a hidden or system-like directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK) under the name XMICNEI.exe. It then immediately executes this downloaded file. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to fetch and run potentially harmful payloads without user consent. The use of a suspicious directory name mimicking Windows system folders and the silent execution of an external executable indicate an attempt to evade detection and persist on the system. The downloaded executable could perform any number of malicious actions such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or damaging the system.",
