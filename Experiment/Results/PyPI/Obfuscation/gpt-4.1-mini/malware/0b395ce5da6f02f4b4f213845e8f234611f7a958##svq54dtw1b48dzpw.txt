      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains multiple malicious behaviors. It attempts to execute a binary named 'kitty.exe' from a package resource, which could be any arbitrary executable and potentially harmful. It also opens a YouTube link in the user's default web browser, which is benign but could be a distraction or social engineering tactic. Most critically, it includes a function that tries to delete all files in the Windows System32 directory using the command 'del C:\\Windows\\System32\\*.*'. This action would severely damage the Windows operating system, rendering it unusable. The code exposes a command-line argument '-k' or '--kill-system' that triggers this destructive behavior. The presence of obfuscated variable names and the destructive system file deletion clearly indicate malicious intent aimed at damaging the system. Therefore, this code is malicious and dangerous.",
