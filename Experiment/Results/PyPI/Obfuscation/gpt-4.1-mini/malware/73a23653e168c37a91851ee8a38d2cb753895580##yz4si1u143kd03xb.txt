      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the machine's hostname, current user, current working directory, and a hardcoded string \"xsetuptools_57.4.0\". It encodes this information in base64, then further encodes it as hexadecimal strings. The encoded data is sent out in multiple ways: by issuing ping commands to a suspicious domain (\".sub.deliverycontent.online\") with the encoded data embedded in the subdomain, and by making HTTP requests (GET and POST) to another suspicious domain (\"www.deliverycontent.online\") with the encoded data as parameters or POST data. This behavior is typical of data exfiltration or beaconing to a command and control (C2) server. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of multiple network communication methods to send encoded system information strongly indicate malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign function and attempts to stealthily leak system details to external servers, which can be used for reconnaissance or further attacks.",
