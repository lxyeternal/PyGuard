      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains obfuscated and encoded data that is decoded and executed at runtime. It imports modules such as base64, marshal, zlib, and cryptography.fernet, and uses multiple layers of decoding and decryption to reconstruct executable code dynamically. The presence of a long base64-encoded string (__mikey__), a large hex string (mydata), and the use of Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt data indicates an attempt to hide the actual payload. The final step uses exec() on the output of a decompression and unmarshalling operation, which executes arbitrary code that is not visible in the source. This behavior is characteristic of malicious code designed to evade detection by hiding its true functionality. The code likely downloads, decrypts, or executes a payload that could perform unauthorized actions such as data theft, system compromise, or persistence. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a security risk.",
