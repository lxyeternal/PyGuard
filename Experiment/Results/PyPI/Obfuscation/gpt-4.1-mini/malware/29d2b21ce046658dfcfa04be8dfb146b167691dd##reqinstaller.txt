      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on Discord's CDN) and saves it to a temporary file on the local system. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.call. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, which fetches and runs potentially harmful executables without user consent. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious activity, such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The use of a temporary file and execution without verification or user interaction makes this code highly suspicious and potentially dangerous.",
