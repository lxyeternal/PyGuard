      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is obfuscated and uses a lambda function to import the 'zlib' and 'base64' modules dynamically. It then decodes a large base64-encoded string, reverses it, decompresses it using zlib, and executes the resulting code with exec(). This technique is commonly used to hide the true intent of the code and evade detection. The presence of such obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious behavior, as it attempts to conceal what the code actually does. Without fully decompressing and decoding the payload, the exact actions cannot be determined, but this pattern is typical of malware or backdoors that execute hidden payloads, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise.",

The payload is reversed before decoding, which is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. After decoding and decompressing, the code executes the resulting Python code using exec(). This behavior is typical of malicious scripts that attempt to hide their true intent by encoding and compressing the payload, then dynamically executing it at runtime. Such code can perform a wide range of harmful actions, including but not limited to downloading and executing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Without fully decompressing and decoding the payload, the exact malicious actions cannot be enumerated here, but the use of these obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques strongly indicates malicious intent.",
