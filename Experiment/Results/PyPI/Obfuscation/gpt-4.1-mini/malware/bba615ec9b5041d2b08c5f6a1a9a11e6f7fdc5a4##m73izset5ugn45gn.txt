      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. Inside the method 'add', it collects system information such as the current user (from environment variable 'USER'), the hostname (from environment variable 'HOSTNAME' and socket.gethostname()), and the current working directory. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external URL (https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/), which is likely controlled by an attacker to collect victim system data. Furthermore, the code establishes a reverse shell connection by creating a socket to '4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io' on port 19931, duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input/output/error, and spawns a shell ('sh'). This effectively gives the remote attacker interactive shell access to the victim machine, allowing arbitrary command execution. This behavior is typical of backdoor or remote access trojan (RAT) malware, posing a severe security risk.",
