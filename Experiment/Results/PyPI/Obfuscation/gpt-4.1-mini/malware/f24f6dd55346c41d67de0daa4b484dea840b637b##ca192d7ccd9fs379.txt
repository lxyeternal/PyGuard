      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression to hide its true functionality. It imports the 'base64', 'zlib', and 'marshal' modules to decode, decompress, and deserialize a byte string that is reversed before decoding. The deserialized code is then executed using 'exec'. This technique is commonly used to conceal malicious payloads such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or unauthorized system control. Because the code is heavily obfuscated and executes dynamically generated code, it poses a high risk of malicious behavior. Without full deobfuscation and analysis of the payload, it is not possible to determine the exact actions, but the use of such obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicates malicious intent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression to hide its true functionality. It imports the 'base64', 'zlib', and 'marshal' modules to decode, decompress, and deserialize a large encoded byte string. The code reverses the input string, base64-decodes it, decompresses it using zlib, and then unmarshals it into Python bytecode, which is then executed with exec(). This technique is commonly used to conceal malicious payloads such as backdoors, trojans, or other harmful scripts. Due to the heavy obfuscation and the use of exec() on dynamically generated code, it is highly likely that this code performs unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system, such as executing arbitrary commands, stealing data, or compromising system integrity. Without fully decompiling the marshaled bytecode, the exact payload cannot be determined, but the obfuscation pattern and execution method strongly indicate malicious intent.",
