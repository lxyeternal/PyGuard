      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from the victim's web browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Opera) using the browser_cookie3 library. It then validates the stolen cookie to check if it is still valid. If valid, it uses the cookie to gather detailed information about the Roblox user account, including UserID, username, Robux balance, friends count, RAP (Recent Average Price), account age, creation date, and profile images via the robloxpy API and Roblox web API. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. All this sensitive information, including the stolen .ROBLOSECURITY cookie, is then sent to a remote Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. This behavior constitutes account credential theft and privacy invasion, enabling the attacker to hijack the victim's Roblox account and potentially perform unauthorized actions or sell the account. The code also uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses errors to avoid detection. Overall, this is malicious code intended for stealing Roblox user credentials and sensitive account data.",
