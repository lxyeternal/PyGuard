      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information to a remote server. Specifically, it gathers the current Python call stack, environment variable keys, system uname information, and the public IP address of the machine by querying 'https://ipinfo.io/ip'. This data is then encoded as JSON and sent via an HTTP POST request to a remote URL (decoded from base64 as 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/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'). The code tries to avoid execution if running on a specific hostname ('lili-pc') or if the script filename matches certain analysis script names, indicating an attempt to evade detection or analysis environments. After sending the data, it prints a message and forcibly exits the program. This behavior is characteristic of malicious spyware or reconnaissance malware designed to gather system information and send it to an attacker-controlled endpoint without user consent.",
