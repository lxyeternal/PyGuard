      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell backdoor. It first queries a DNS TXT record from the domain 'poiqwe.info' to retrieve a port number dynamically. Then, it attempts to establish a TCP connection to 'poiqwe.info' on that port. Upon successful connection, it redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to the socket, and spawns a bash shell using pty.spawn. This effectively gives the remote server shell access to the compromised machine, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely. Additionally, if the script is imported as a module rather than run directly, it makes an HTTP GET request to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_bad', which could be used for tracking or triggering further malicious actions. This behavior is characteristic of malware designed for unauthorized remote control and potential exploitation of the victim system.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code overrides the standard setuptools 'develop' and 'install' commands with custom classes that perform HTTP GET requests to suspicious external URLs (http://poiqwe.info/install_pre, http://poiqwe.info/install_post, and their '_dev' variants) during the installation or development setup process. These requests are made without any clear legitimate purpose, potentially leaking information about the environment or triggering remote actions controlled by an attacker. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to hide the true intent. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoors embedded in installation scripts to perform unauthorized network communication, data exfiltration, or to signal a compromised system to a command-and-control server. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a security risk.",
