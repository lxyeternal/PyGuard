      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64, zlib compression, and character code transformations. It dynamically constructs and executes code at runtime using eval and exec functions. Such techniques are commonly used to hide malicious payloads or behaviors. The code imports cryptographic and compression libraries, but the main suspicious aspect is the execution of decoded and decompressed data, which is not human-readable and is designed to evade static analysis. This behavior strongly indicates that the code is intended to execute hidden or unauthorized operations, which could include data exfiltration, system compromise, or other harmful actions. Therefore, this code is malicious.",
