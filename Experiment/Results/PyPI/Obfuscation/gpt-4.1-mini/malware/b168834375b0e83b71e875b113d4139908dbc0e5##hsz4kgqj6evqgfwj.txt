      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports everything from a relative module named 'src_file' and then calls a function with a highly obfuscated and nonsensical name 'AkaZRlGQjVIqeitKqceyYidozfYNwsXp'. The use of such an obfuscated function name is a common tactic in malicious code to evade detection and analysis. Additionally, the code imports 'colorama', which is typically used for colored terminal output, possibly to disguise or enhance the output of malicious actions. Without the source of 'src_file' and the function definition, it is impossible to know the exact behavior, but the obfuscation strongly suggests malicious intent. This function could perform harmful actions such as executing arbitrary code, stealing data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and likely malicious.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a malicious wallet stealer targeting the Exodus cryptocurrency wallet on Windows systems. It attempts to locate sensitive wallet files and configuration files stored in the user's roaming appdata directory and other common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It compresses these files into a zip archive named with the user's name and 'exodus.zip'. The script then sends this archive along with a message containing the victim's username and geolocation information (retrieved via an external IP API) to a Telegram bot controlled by the attacker, using a hardcoded bot token and chat ID. After sending the data, it attempts to delete the zip archive to cover its tracks. The purpose of this code is to steal cryptocurrency wallet data, including seeds, passphrases, and two-factor authentication secrets, which can lead to theft of the victim's cryptocurrency funds. This behavior is clearly malicious and constitutes a security threat.",
