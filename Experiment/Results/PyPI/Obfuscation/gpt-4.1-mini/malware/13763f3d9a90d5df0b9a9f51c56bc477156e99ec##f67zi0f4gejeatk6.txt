      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'Netflix_Checker.exe' from a suspicious IP address (http://194.163.191.205:6963) and saves it to the user's Documents folder under the name 'netflix_checker_cache.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.startfile. This behavior is typical of malware or potentially unwanted programs that silently download and run external executables without user consent. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious action such as stealing data, installing backdoors, or damaging the system. The use of a direct IP address instead of a domain name and the generic naming suggest an attempt to evade detection and analysis.",
