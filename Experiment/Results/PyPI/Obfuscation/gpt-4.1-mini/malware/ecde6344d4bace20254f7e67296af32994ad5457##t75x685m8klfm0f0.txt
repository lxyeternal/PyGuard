      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a function that fetches a text file from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), which presumably contains a list of filenames filtered by the current operating system. For each filename, it attempts to download a corresponding executable from the same remote server and saves it locally. Then, it sets executable permissions (on Linux/macOS) and runs the downloaded executable in the background. This behavior effectively downloads and executes potentially untrusted code from a remote server without user consent, which is a common pattern in malware for establishing persistence, downloading payloads, or executing arbitrary code. Additionally, the code obfuscates function and variable names, which is typical in malicious scripts to evade detection and analysis. The repeated calls to MOtdFBydLTyOrOGHwwvqJjsIFDbTJRLn() in all HTTP method wrappers suggest that any network request triggers this malicious download and execution routine, further indicating malicious intent.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'frequest' which is not a standard Python library or a commonly known third-party package. The imported names include 'get' and 'delete', which resemble HTTP methods, but also several obfuscated and nonsensical identifiers such as 'eDWltuiSWqxMgFDPWVHvhbMEiGFDeois' and 'miCDkkTxiiiYJIkMeqOcZjSLbSiGqEuH'. The use of such obfuscated names is a common tactic in malicious code to hide the true functionality and evade detection. Without the actual implementation of these functions, it is highly suspicious that the code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful network operations, possibly including data exfiltration, command and control communication, or deletion of resources. The presence of 'delete' also suggests potential destructive actions. Therefore, this code snippet is likely part of a malicious payload intended to perform harmful network interactions or system modifications.",
