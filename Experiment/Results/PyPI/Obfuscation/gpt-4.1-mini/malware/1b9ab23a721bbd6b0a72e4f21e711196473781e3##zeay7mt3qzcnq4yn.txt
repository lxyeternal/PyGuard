      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a remote URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh) and saves it to the user's home directory. It then sets executable permissions on this script and executes it with elevated privileges (via /bin/bash) with specific arguments. Additionally, it runs system commands to update package lists and install 'tmux' without user consent. This behavior is suspicious because it fetches and runs external code dynamically, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system. The downloaded script could contain any malicious payload, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The obfuscated function and variable names suggest an attempt to hide the code's intent. Overall, this code acts as a downloader and executor of potentially harmful scripts, which is a common pattern in malware.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads scripts from a remote URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/inits-v4/) based on user-supplied script names and an ID parameter. It then executes the downloaded content as shell commands using subprocess with shell=True. Notably, if the script name is 'sys', it runs the commands with sudo privileges, potentially allowing privilege escalation. This behavior enables remote code execution of arbitrary commands fetched from an external server, which can lead to full system compromise, data theft, or destruction. The obfuscated variable names and lack of validation or sandboxing further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious as it facilitates unauthorized remote execution of arbitrary code with possible root privileges.",
