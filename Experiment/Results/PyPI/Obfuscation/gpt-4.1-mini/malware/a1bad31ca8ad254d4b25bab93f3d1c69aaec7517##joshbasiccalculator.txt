      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect Discord and various browser tokens stored locally on the victim's machine. It searches through local storage directories of Discord, Discord Canary, Discord PTB, Google Chrome, Opera, Brave, and Yandex browsers for files ending with .log or .ldb, which may contain sensitive tokens matching Discord token regex patterns. The collected tokens are then formatted into a message and sent to a remote Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive authentication tokens to an attacker-controlled server. This behavior enables unauthorized access to the victim's Discord accounts and potentially other services, leading to account compromise, identity theft, and further malicious activities. The code uses obfuscated variable names and attempts to silently send data without user consent, which is characteristic of malicious token stealers.",
