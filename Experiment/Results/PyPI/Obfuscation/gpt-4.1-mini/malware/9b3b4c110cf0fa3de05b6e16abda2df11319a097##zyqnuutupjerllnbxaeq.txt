      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious credential and data stealer targeting Windows systems. It collects sensitive user information including Discord tokens, emails, phone numbers, billing information, Discord friends with special badges, browser cookies, saved passwords, and wallet data from various browsers and applications such as Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, Discord variants, Steam, Exodus, Metamask, Telegram, and others. The code decrypts encrypted browser data using Windows cryptographic APIs and AES decryption. It searches user directories for files containing keywords related to accounts, passwords, backups, and private data. It collects this data, compresses it into zip files, uploads them to a file hosting service (gofile.io), and sends the stolen information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code also attempts to install missing Python packages silently. The overall purpose is to exfiltrate private user credentials and data to an attacker-controlled server, enabling account takeover, financial theft, privacy invasion, and further malicious activities. This code is a clear example of a credential stealer malware.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a suspiciously named function 'IUOCZmJRhWyhkGhhqjbRabLbYKuKHuWK' from a non-standard module 'module.pytoolib', which is not a known or trusted Python library. The function name appears to be obfuscated or randomly generated, a common tactic used to evade detection. The function is then called with the argument 'boolean', but without access to the module's source code, the exact behavior is unknown. However, such obfuscation and use of unknown modules strongly suggest malicious intent, potentially executing hidden payloads, performing unauthorized actions, or compromising the system. This pattern is typical in malware or backdoor scripts designed to hide their true purpose.",
