      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to create a reverse shell by connecting to a remote server at shell.attacker.local on port 443. It uses the socket module to establish a TCP connection and then spawns a /bin/bash shell with its input, output, and error streams redirected to the socket. This effectively gives the remote server interactive shell access to the compromised machine, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands remotely. The try-except block suppresses any errors to avoid detection, and the infinite loop printing '1' likely serves to keep the script running. This behavior is characteristic of a backdoor or remote access trojan, which is malicious as it compromises system security and privacy.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated payload that is base64-decoded and executed at runtime using exec(). The decoded payload attempts to import subprocess and socket modules, then creates a socket connection to 'shell.attacker.local' on port 443. It then opens a subprocess running '/bin/bash' with stdin, stdout, and stderr redirected to the socket, effectively creating a reverse shell. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine, leading to full system compromise. The use of obfuscation and dynamic execution is a common technique to evade detection.",
