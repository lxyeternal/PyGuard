It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.startfile. This behavior is typical of malware or malicious scripts that attempt to download and run potentially harmful software without user consent. The downloaded executable could contain viruses, trojans, ransomware, or other malicious payloads, posing a significant security risk to the system.",
