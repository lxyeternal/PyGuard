      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including base64 decoding and custom transformations. It dynamically reconstructs and executes code using eval and exec functions, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to hide their true intent. The code imports modules for base64 encoding/decoding, string manipulation, and byte operations, then decodes a large base64-encoded payload that is further processed and executed at runtime. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to evade detection by hiding their payload and executing it only after decoding. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate that the code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions, such as executing hidden malicious payloads, potentially compromising the system or stealing data.",
