      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to access the Google Cloud metadata server at the IP address 169.254.169.254 to retrieve an access token for the default service account. This token is sensitive as it can be used to authenticate API requests with the permissions of the service account. The code then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to an external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log), which is likely controlled by an attacker. This behavior constitutes a token exfiltration attack, where the attacker tries to steal cloud credentials to gain unauthorized access to cloud resources. The obfuscated variable names and the use of a metadata server token endpoint strongly indicate malicious intent. The rest of the code (a simple print function) is benign and unrelated.",
