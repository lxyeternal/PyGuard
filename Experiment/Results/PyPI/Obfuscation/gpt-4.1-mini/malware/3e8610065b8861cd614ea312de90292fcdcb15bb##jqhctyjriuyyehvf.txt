      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious Discord token and credential stealer targeting Windows systems. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **Token and Credential Theft:** The code searches for Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, and other sensitive data from various browsers and Discord clients by accessing local files and decrypting stored credentials using Windows cryptographic APIs.\n\n2. **Data Exfiltration:** Stolen data including Discord tokens, user information (email, phone, badges, friends), browser cookies, passwords, and other files are collected and sent to a remote Discord webhook URL (hardcoded in the variable `EynKMGtFQQGrnuGGTvufqmiSpUvfQWeo`). This allows the attacker to receive the victim's sensitive information remotely.\n\n3. **Persistence and Evasion:** The code attempts to install required Python modules if missing, uses obfuscated variable and function names to hinder analysis, and checks for certain conditions (e.g., presence of 'google.com' in tokens) to possibly avoid detection or execution in certain environments.\n\n4. **System Information Gathering:** It collects IP address, geolocation, username, and other system details to provide context about the victim.\n\n5. **File Collection:** The code searches common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files with keywords related to accounts, passwords, secrets, wallets, etc., uploads them to a file hosting service, and sends links to the attacker.\n\n6. **Process Interference:** It kills certain processes (e.g., browsers) to access locked files and zip them for exfiltration.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily harvest sensitive user data, especially Discord tokens and browser credentials, and send them to an attacker-controlled endpoint, constituting a severe privacy and security threat.",
