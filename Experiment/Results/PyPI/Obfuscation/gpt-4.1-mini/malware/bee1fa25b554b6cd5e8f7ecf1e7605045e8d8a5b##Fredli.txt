      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'Oxzy.exe' from a remote URL hosted on Dropbox and saves it to the TEMP directory on the local machine. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.system. This behavior is characteristic of malware or a dropper, as it fetches and runs potentially harmful code without user consent. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious actions such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or damaging the system. The obfuscated class and method names suggest an attempt to evade detection.",
