      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to download a file from a remote server (http://145.249.104.71/out) and save it locally as '.drv' in the user's home directory on Linux systems. It then changes the file's permissions to make it executable. After that, it appends a command to the user's '.bashrc' file to execute this downloaded file in the background every time a new shell session starts. This behavior is typical of malware or a persistent backdoor, as it ensures the downloaded executable runs automatically on user login, potentially allowing unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The code also suppresses execution on non-Linux systems by printing an error and exiting. Overall, this code is malicious as it downloads and persistently executes potentially harmful code without user consent.",
