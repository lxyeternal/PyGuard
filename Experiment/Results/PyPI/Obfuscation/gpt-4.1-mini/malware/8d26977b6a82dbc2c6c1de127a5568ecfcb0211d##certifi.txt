This remote script is downloaded and executed at runtime via exec(), which is a common technique used in malicious code to run arbitrary code from an external source without the user's knowledge. This behavior can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially compromising the system by running untrusted code, stealing data, or performing other harmful actions. The use of base64 encoding to hide the exec statement further indicates an attempt to conceal the malicious intent.",
