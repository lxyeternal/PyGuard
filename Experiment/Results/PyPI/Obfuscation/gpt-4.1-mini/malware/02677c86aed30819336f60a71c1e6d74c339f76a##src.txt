      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily extract a Roblox security cookie from the Windows registry, specifically from the Roblox Studio browser's stored keys. It accesses the registry key 'SOFTWARE\\Roblox\\RobloxStudioBrowser\\roblox.com' under the current user hive and searches for the '.ROBLOSECURITY' value, which contains sensitive authentication information. The code then parses this cookie and sends it to a remote Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. This behavior constitutes a cookie grabber or stealer, which can be used to hijack the victim's Roblox account or perform unauthorized actions on their behalf. The code operates without user consent and transmits sensitive data to an external server, making it malicious and a security threat.",
