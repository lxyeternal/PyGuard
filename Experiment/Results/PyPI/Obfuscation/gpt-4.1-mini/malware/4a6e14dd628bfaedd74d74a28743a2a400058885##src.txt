      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code uses the function __pyarmor__ with a large byte string argument. This pattern is characteristic of code obfuscated or encrypted by PyArmor, a tool used to protect Python scripts by encrypting and wrapping them in a loader. While PyArmor itself is a legitimate tool, it is often used to hide malicious payloads or unauthorized code because it makes static analysis and reverse engineering difficult. The presence of such obfuscated code without any readable logic or comments strongly suggests an attempt to conceal the actual behavior of the script. Without decrypting or running the code in a controlled environment, it is impossible to determine the exact actions, but the obfuscation indicates potential malicious intent such as hiding malware, backdoors, or unauthorized data exfiltration. Therefore, this code should be treated as malicious or at least suspicious and handled with caution.",
