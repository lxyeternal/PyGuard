      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a hidden directory named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' which mimics a Windows system folder to avoid suspicion. It then downloads an executable file named 'main.exe' from a Discord CDN URL, saves it into this hidden directory under the name 'XMICNEI.exe', and immediately executes it. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful payload on the victim's machine. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious actions such as installing backdoors, stealing data, or damaging the system. The use of an external URL to fetch and run an executable without user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
