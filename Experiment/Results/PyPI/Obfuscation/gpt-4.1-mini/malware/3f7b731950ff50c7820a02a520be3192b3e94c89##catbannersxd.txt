      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'winsysupdate.exe' from a remote URL hosted on Discord's CDN and saves it locally. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.system. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware, as it fetches and runs an external binary without user consent or verification. The downloaded executable could perform any harmful actions on the host system, such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising system integrity. The code itself does not verify the authenticity or safety of the downloaded file, making it potentially dangerous.",
