      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious stealer malware targeting Windows systems. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **Token and Credential Stealing:** The code searches for Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, and other sensitive data from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge) and Discord clients (Discord, Lightcord, Discord Canary, PTB). It decrypts encrypted data such as passwords and tokens using Windows cryptographic APIs.\n\n2. **Data Exfiltration:** Stolen data including Discord tokens, user information (email, phone, badges), cookies, passwords, and files from user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) are collected and sent to a remote Discord webhook URL. The webhook URL is hardcoded and used to exfiltrate the stolen information.\n\n3. **Persistence and Evasion:** The code attempts to install missing Python modules automatically, uses threading to speed up data collection, and suppresses exceptions to avoid crashing. It also kills certain processes (e.g., browsers or wallet apps) to access locked files.\n\n4. **File Collection and Upload:** It collects files with sensitive keywords in user folders, compresses them into zip archives, uploads them to a file hosting service, and sends the download links to the attacker.\n\n5. **Use of Obfuscation:** Variable names are obfuscated, making analysis harder, which is typical for malware.\n\n6. **Targeted Data:** The malware targets cryptocurrency wallets, gaming clients, messaging apps, and other applications where sensitive credentials or tokens might be stored.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily harvest sensitive user data and send it to an attacker-controlled server, constituting a serious privacy and security threat.",
