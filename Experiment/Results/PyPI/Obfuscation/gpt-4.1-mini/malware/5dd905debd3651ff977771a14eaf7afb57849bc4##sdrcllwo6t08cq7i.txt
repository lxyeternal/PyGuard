      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from the victim's browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library. It then validates the stolen cookie to check if it is still valid. If valid, it uses the cookie to gather detailed user information from Roblox, including UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, creation date, and username. It also fetches the user's IP address via an external service (api.ipify.org). All this sensitive information, including the stolen .ROBLOSECURITY cookie and the victim's IP address, is then sent to a Discord webhook URL (stored in the variable VCMTzrTvLAHDEoNLbshluxgmzujYZlJL). This behavior constitutes a cookie stealer and information stealer malware aimed at compromising Roblox accounts by exfiltrating authentication tokens and personal data to an attacker-controlled Discord channel. The code also contains obfuscation-like variable names and uses system calls (os.system) which could be used for further malicious commands, but the primary malicious intent is the theft and exfiltration of Roblox cookies and user data.",
