      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily steal Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from the victim's browser by extracting cookies from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library. It then validates the stolen cookie using the robloxpy API to check if it is still valid. If valid, it collects detailed user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, and other profile data via Roblox APIs. The script then sends all this sensitive information, including the stolen .ROBLOSECURITY cookie and the victim's public IP address, to a remote Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. This behavior constitutes a cookie stealer and account information grabber, which can lead to unauthorized access to the victim's Roblox account, potential account takeover, theft of virtual assets, and privacy invasion. The code also contains obfuscated variable names and suppresses errors during cookie extraction to avoid detection. Overall, this is malicious code intended for credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration.",
