      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It is designed to stealthily collect sensitive user information from the local machine, including saved passwords, cookies, login data, download history, and browsing history from multiple popular browsers such as Chrome, Edge, Opera, Brave, and others. The code decrypts stored credentials using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption, extracts user tokens and session data, and sends this information to a remote server via HTTP POST requests. It also attempts to gather system environment details like username, computer name, and IP address. The code creates local directories and files to temporarily store this data, then cleans up after exfiltration. The overall purpose is to steal user credentials and browsing data, which can lead to unauthorized access, identity theft, and privacy breaches. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or credential-stealing malware.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code implements a Discord bot that performs several malicious actions: \n\n1. **Discord Bot with Token:** The bot uses a hardcoded Discord token to connect to a Discord server, allowing remote control.\n\n2. **Cookie Stealing:** The bot copies the Google Chrome cookies database from the victim's machine, attempts to decrypt the cookies, and sends the stolen cookies as a text file to a Discord channel. This can lead to session hijacking and unauthorized access to the victim's web accounts.\n\n3. **Screenshot Capture:** The bot can take screenshots of the victim's screen using the ImageGrab module and send the images to the Discord server, violating privacy.\n\n4. **Information Gathering:** On startup, the bot collects system information such as OS, CPU, IP address, and username, and sends an embedded message to a Discord channel indicating a new infected user.\n\n5. **Obfuscation and Evasion:** The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses Discord library logging to avoid detection.\n\nOverall, this code is a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that allows an attacker to remotely steal sensitive data (cookies), spy on the victim (screenshots), and gather system information, all controlled via Discord commands. This behavior is clearly malicious and poses significant privacy and security risks.",
