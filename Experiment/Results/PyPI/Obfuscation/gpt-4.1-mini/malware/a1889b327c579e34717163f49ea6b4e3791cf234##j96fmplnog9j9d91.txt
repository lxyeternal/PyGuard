It then attempts to execute this downloaded file using os.startfile. This behavior is typical of malware or malicious scripts that fetch and run potentially harmful executables from the internet without user consent. The downloaded executable could contain viruses, trojans, ransomware, or other malicious payloads, posing a significant security risk to the system running this script.",
