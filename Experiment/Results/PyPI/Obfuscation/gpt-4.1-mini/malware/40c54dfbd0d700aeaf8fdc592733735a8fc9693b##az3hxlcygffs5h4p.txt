      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on Discord's CDN) and saves it to a hidden location within the user's AppData\\Local directory under the name 'explorer.exe'. It then attempts to execute this downloaded file. This behavior is typical of malware that tries to stealthily download and run potentially harmful executables on the victim's machine. The use of environment variables to construct the path and the choice of filename mimicking a legitimate Windows process ('explorer.exe') suggests an attempt to evade detection. Running an unknown executable from the internet without user consent can lead to system compromise, data theft, or further malware infection.",
