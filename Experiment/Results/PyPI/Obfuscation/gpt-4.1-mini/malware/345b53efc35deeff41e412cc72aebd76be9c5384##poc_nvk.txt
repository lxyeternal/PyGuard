      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, operating system name, and local IP address of the machine it is running on. It then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a remote server at the URL 'https://eobngnpuin253ze.m.pipedream.net/poc'. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, where potentially sensitive information about the victim's environment is transmitted without user consent. The obfuscated variable names and the use of an external endpoint for data transmission further suggest an attempt to hide the true intent of the code. Such actions can be used for reconnaissance by attackers to gather information about compromised systems, which can lead to further exploitation or privacy violations.",
