      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on Discord's CDN) and saves it locally as 'discomusic.exe'. This behavior is suspicious because it silently fetches and writes an executable file without user consent or any indication of its purpose. Such actions are commonly used in malware delivery to download and execute malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The code itself does not execute the downloaded file, but saving an unknown executable from an untrusted source poses a significant security risk, as the file could contain viruses, trojans, ransomware, or other harmful software.",
