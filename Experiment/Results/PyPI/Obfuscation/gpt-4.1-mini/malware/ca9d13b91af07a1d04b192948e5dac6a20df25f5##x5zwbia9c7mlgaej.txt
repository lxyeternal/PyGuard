      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression to hide its true functionality. It imports modules such as random, base64, codecs, and zlib, and then defines a complex lambda function that decodes and executes a compressed and base64-encoded payload. The code uses eval and exec on dynamically generated strings, which is a common technique in malicious scripts to evade detection and analysis. The obfuscated payload likely contains code that executes arbitrary commands or performs unauthorized actions on the host system. Given the use of such obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and the lack of any legitimate functionality, this code is malicious. Its purpose is to conceal harmful behavior, potentially including unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
