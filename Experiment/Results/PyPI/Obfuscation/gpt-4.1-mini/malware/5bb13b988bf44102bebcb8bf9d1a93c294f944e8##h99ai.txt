      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to download and execute a shell script from an external URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh) without verifying its integrity or authenticity. It uses urllib.request.urlretrieve with a malformed URL string that actually contains a curl command instead of a direct URL, which will cause an error or unexpected behavior. If corrected to download the script, it saves the script to the user's home directory, makes it executable, installs tmux via apt without user confirmation, and then runs the downloaded script with specific arguments. This behavior is suspicious because it downloads and executes remote code, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or persistence mechanisms. The obfuscated function name and the use of a non-standard domain further suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, this code exhibits characteristics typical of malware or unauthorized remote code execution payloads.",
