      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious malware script designed to steal sensitive user information from a Windows system. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **Credential Theft:** It accesses and decrypts stored passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history from multiple browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, Edge, etc.) by reading their local databases and decrypting encrypted data using Windows DPAPI and AES.\n\n2. **Discord Token Stealing:** It extracts Discord tokens from various Discord clients and validates them by querying Discord's API, collecting user information such as username, email, phone, badges, billing info, and Nitro subscription status.\n\n3. **Clipboard Hijacking:** It monitors the clipboard for cryptocurrency wallet addresses and replaces them with attacker-controlled addresses to hijack cryptocurrency transactions.\n\n4. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information including IP address, geolocation, hardware IDs, Windows product keys, RAM, disk space, CPU count, and running processes.\n\n5. **Anti-Debugging and Anti-VM Checks:** It checks for the presence of debugging tools, virtual machine environments, and known analysis environments to avoid detection and terminate execution if found.\n\n6. **Persistence:** It attempts to copy itself to the Windows startup folder to run on system startup.\n\n7. **Data Exfiltration:** It packages the stolen data into files and archives, then sends them to a remote attacker-controlled webhook URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay) via HTTP POST requests.\n\n8. **Process Killing:** Optionally kills Discord processes to prevent interference.\n\n9. **Self-Cleaning:** It can remove temporary files and exit cleanly.\n\nOverall, this code is a sophisticated information stealer (stealer malware) targeting Windows users, especially those using Discord and cryptocurrency wallets. It compromises user privacy, security, and financial assets by exfiltrating sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server.",
