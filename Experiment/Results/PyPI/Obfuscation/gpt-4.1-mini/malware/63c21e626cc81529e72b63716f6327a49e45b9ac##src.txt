      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated and encoded payload executed at the very beginning via a base64-decoded string passed to exec(). This payload imports modules and executes a system command that fetches and executes code from a remote URL: 'https://rentry.co/7nqxy/raw'. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware component, which attempts to retrieve and run potentially harmful code from the internet without user consent. The rest of the code appears to be complex, obfuscated, and related to terminal manipulation and colored text output, likely to disguise or support the malicious payload. The initial hidden remote code execution is a clear indicator of malicious intent, as it can lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation.",
