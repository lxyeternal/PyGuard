      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'launcher.exe' from a remote URL hosted on Discord's CDN and immediately executes it on the local machine. After execution, it deletes the downloaded file. This behavior is characteristic of a dropper or downloader malware, which fetches and runs potentially harmful software without user consent. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious actions such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The code itself does not verify the integrity or safety of the downloaded file, making it a security risk.",
