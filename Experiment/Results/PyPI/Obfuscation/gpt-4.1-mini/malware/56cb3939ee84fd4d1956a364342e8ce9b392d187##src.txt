      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It implements an SMS bomber tool designed to send a large number of unsolicited SMS messages (often OTPs or verification codes) to specified phone numbers. The code abuses multiple third-party APIs and services by repeatedly triggering OTP or SMS sending endpoints without the consent of the target number's owner. This behavior constitutes harassment, denial of service, and abuse of telecommunication services. The script also includes features to bypass some protections (e.g., protected numbers), uses obfuscated variable names, and attempts to install dependencies automatically. It fetches configuration and control data from remote URLs, indicating potential remote control or updates. The tool can send SMS messages to single or multiple numbers, supports different telecom operators, and uses various APIs to maximize the number of messages sent. Such actions can cause significant annoyance, disrupt the victim's phone usage, and potentially incur costs or security risks. Therefore, this code is malicious and intended for abusive purposes.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to import a module named 'bomber' and execute a function with a suspiciously obfuscated name 'vSGofgdxbvUaSWnoEUnTHwyhvRiIPxpR'. If the module is not found, it tries to install a package named 'haxorsiambot' (note the typo in '--upgarde' which should be '--upgrade'), which is likely a malicious package. The naming and behavior strongly suggest that this code is designed to run a 'bomber' attack, which typically refers to sending a large number of requests or messages to overwhelm a target (e.g., SMS bomber, email bomber, or network attack). This can cause denial of service or harassment. The obfuscation and attempt to install a suspicious package at runtime are common traits of malicious code.",
