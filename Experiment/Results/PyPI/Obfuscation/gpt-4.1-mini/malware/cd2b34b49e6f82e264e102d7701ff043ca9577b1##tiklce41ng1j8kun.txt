      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is obfuscated and attempts to decode and execute hidden payloads. It imports modules commonly used for network requests, encoding/decoding, and file system operations. The code contains multiple large base64-encoded and encoded strings assigned to variables with random names, which are then decoded and combined using eval and compile functions. The final step is an eval(compile(base64.b64decode(...))) call, which executes the decoded payload dynamically. This behavior is typical of malicious code that tries to hide its true intent by obfuscation and dynamic execution. The code likely downloads or contains a payload that could perform unauthorized actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise. The use of try-except to silently pass on errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to execute hidden harmful operations.",
