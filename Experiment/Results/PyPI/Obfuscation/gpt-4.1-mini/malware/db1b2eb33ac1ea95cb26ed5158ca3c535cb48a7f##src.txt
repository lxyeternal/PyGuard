      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed at runtime using builtins.exec and compile. This payload fetches and executes code from a remote URL (https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/7bupb/raw) via urllib.request.urlopen, which is a common technique used by malware to download and run additional malicious code dynamically. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and remote code fetching strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code appears to be complex and obfuscated, likely to hide its true purpose and evade detection. The initial executed payload can run arbitrary code from the internet, which can lead to compromise of the host system, data theft, or other harmful actions.",
