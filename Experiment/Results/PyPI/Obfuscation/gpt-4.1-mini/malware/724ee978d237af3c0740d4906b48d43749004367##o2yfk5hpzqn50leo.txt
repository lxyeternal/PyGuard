      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate its true functionality, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. The code decodes a large base64-encoded string and executes it using exec(), which can run arbitrary Python code. The obfuscated payload is designed to evade detection and analysis. Such behavior is typical of malware, backdoors, or trojans that aim to execute hidden commands, potentially compromising the system, stealing data, or performing unauthorized actions. The use of multiple layers of string replacements before execution further complicates analysis and indicates an attempt to conceal the actual code logic. Overall, this code poses a security risk and should be treated as malicious.",
