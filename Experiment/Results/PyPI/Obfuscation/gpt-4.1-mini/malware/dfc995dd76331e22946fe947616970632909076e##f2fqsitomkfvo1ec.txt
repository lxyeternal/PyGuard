      "malicious_behavior": "This code collects system information including the hostname (nodename), current user, current working directory, and a fixed string identifier ('AadhaarCrypt_1.0'). It encodes this information in base64, then further encodes it as hex strings with some randomization. The code then attempts to exfiltrate this encoded data to a remote server 'deliverycontent.online' by sending multiple HTTP requests (GET and POST) to various endpoints on that domain, using different Python HTTP libraries (urllib.request, requests, urllib). Additionally, it attempts to send the encoded data via ICMP ping commands to subdomains of 'deliverycontent.online'. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of multiple methods to send data out indicate an attempt to stealthily leak system information to a remote attacker-controlled server. This behavior is characteristic of spyware or data exfiltration malware, which can compromise user privacy and security.",
