      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious remote access trojan (RAT) and information stealer targeting Windows systems. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **Persistence:** It attempts to copy itself to the Windows startup folder to run automatically on system boot.\n\n2. **Credential Theft:** It accesses and decrypts stored browser data from multiple Chromium-based browsers and Firefox, including saved passwords, cookies, credit card information, and browsing history. It uses Windows APIs (CryptUnprotectData) and AES decryption to extract sensitive data.\n\n3. **Discord Token Stealing:** It scans local storage files for Discord authentication tokens using regex patterns and collects them.\n\n4. **Keylogging:** It hooks into the keyboard input to log keystrokes and sends the logged data to a remote server.\n\n5. **System Information Gathering:** It collects detailed system information such as hardware UUID, username, computer name, OS version, IP addresses, and machine type.\n\n6. **Screenshot and Webcam Capture:** It takes screenshots and captures webcam images without user consent.\n\n7. **File System Access:** It can list directories, download files, and upload files from/to the victim's machine.\n\n8. **Remote Command Execution:** It listens for commands from a remote server and executes them on the victim's machine, sending back the output.\n\n9. **Data Exfiltration:** All stolen data (credentials, tokens, system info, screenshots, webcam images, files) is sent to a remote server via socket.io and HTTP POST requests.\n\n10. **Obfuscation:** The code uses obfuscated variable and class names to hinder analysis.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily steal sensitive user data, monitor user activity, and provide remote control to an attacker, posing severe privacy and security risks.",
