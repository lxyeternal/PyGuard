      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code implements a keylogger that captures keystrokes from the user using the 'pynput' library. It listens to keyboard events, records all keys pressed (including special keys like enter, backspace, space, and ctrl), and stores them in a buffer. After the keylogging session ends (triggered by pressing the escape key), the code attempts to send the recorded keystrokes via email to a specified Gmail address using SMTP over SSL. The email credentials and recipient addresses are hardcoded in the script. This behavior is malicious because it covertly captures sensitive user input (potentially including passwords, personal messages, and other confidential data) without user consent and exfiltrates it to an external email address, which can lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, and unauthorized access to personal or corporate information.",
