      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a function rPDcogOhqRGKjjemRCDZcoVjFWCcrWOp() that performs the following actions: it detects the operating system of the host machine, then downloads a text file from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt). This file presumably contains a list of filenames relevant to the detected OS. For each filename, the code attempts to download a corresponding executable from the same remote server and saves it locally. It then sets executable permissions on Unix-like systems and executes the downloaded file in the background. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware component that fetches and runs potentially harmful executables from a remote server without user consent. Additionally, the code overrides common HTTP request methods (get, post, put, patch, delete, head, options) to call this malicious downloader function before performing the actual request, ensuring the malicious payload is fetched and executed whenever these functions are used. The obfuscation of variable and function names further indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute remote binaries, which can lead to unauthorized control, data theft, or further infection of the host system.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'frequest' which is not a standard Python library and appears suspicious. Additionally, it imports several functions or variables with obfuscated, nonsensical names (e.g., 'jlLhxxflGYeiNvOvBLKOdaaAXBugfCkM', 'UCuPRhJvMDIhevKnWeoIoaHySZltapYc'), which is a common tactic used to hide malicious intent. The presence of such obfuscated imports suggests the code is designed to perform hidden or unauthorized actions, potentially including unauthorized network requests, data exfiltration, or manipulation of system resources. Without further code, the exact behavior cannot be fully determined, but the import pattern strongly indicates malicious intent.",
