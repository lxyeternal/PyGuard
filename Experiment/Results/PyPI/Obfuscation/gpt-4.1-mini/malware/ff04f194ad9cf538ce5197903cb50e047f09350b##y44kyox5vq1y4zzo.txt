      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports everything from the 'requests' library and then imports a module with a suspicious, obfuscated name '.vxcmtZrKygFnzMwhjzecXYZeyRfGVuIN'. The use of a relative import with a non-descriptive, randomized module name is a common tactic to hide malicious payloads or backdoor functionality. Since the imported module is not shown, it is highly likely that it contains malicious code such as data exfiltration, command and control communication, or other harmful operations. The obfuscation and relative import strongly indicate an attempt to conceal malicious behavior.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function that fetches Python code from a remote URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmnstnd/http3_client/main/cdn), decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically using exec(). This behavior allows the remote server to run arbitrary code on the local machine without user consent or inspection. Such dynamic remote code execution is a common vector for malware, backdoors, or other malicious payloads. The use of threading to run this function (although the thread is not started in the snippet) suggests an intent to run this code asynchronously or stealthily. Overall, this code is malicious because it enables remote code injection and execution, which can lead to unauthorized control, data theft, or system compromise.",
