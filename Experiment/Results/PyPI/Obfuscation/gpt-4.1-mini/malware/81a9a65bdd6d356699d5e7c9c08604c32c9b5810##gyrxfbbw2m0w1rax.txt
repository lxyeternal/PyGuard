      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is obfuscated and contains multiple layers of encoded and compressed data, which it decodes and executes at runtime. It imports modules related to HTTP requests, threading, JSON handling, and base64 decoding, which are commonly used in network communication and data manipulation. The code fetches content from a remote URL (a GitHub raw content link) and writes it into a local file path within the user's Discord app data directory, replacing certain placeholder strings with a specific token value. It then attempts to gather user data such as username, user ID, avatar ID, email, phone, bio, banner ID, locale, and verification status from Discord's API endpoints, using authorization tokens. This data collection is done surreptitiously and sent to a remote server (discord.com API endpoints and a suspicious URL 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...'). The code also appears to maintain a list of working user IDs and tokens, appending new tokens to this list, and performs repeated network requests to Discord's API, likely to harvest sensitive user information. The obfuscation and the nature of the operations strongly indicate that this code is designed to steal Discord user credentials and personal information, potentially for unauthorized access or account hijacking. This behavior is malicious as it compromises user privacy and security, and it operates without user consent.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is obfuscated and contains multiple layers of encoded and compressed data, which it decodes and executes at runtime. It imports modules commonly used for network requests, threading, and system operations, and then fetches remote content from URLs such as raw.githubusercontent.com and discord.com API endpoints. The code attempts to retrieve and replace content in local files, likely to inject malicious payloads or backdoors. It collects user data including username, user ID, avatar ID, email, phone, bio, banner ID, locale, and verification status from Discord's API, which indicates it is designed to steal sensitive user information. The code also appears to send this data to a remote server (discord.com/api/webhooks/...), which is a common pattern for exfiltrating stolen data. The obfuscation and use of eval/compile with base64-decoded strings are typical techniques to evade detection and analysis. Overall, this code is malicious, functioning as a data stealer and possibly a backdoor, posing a significant security risk to any system where it is executed.",
