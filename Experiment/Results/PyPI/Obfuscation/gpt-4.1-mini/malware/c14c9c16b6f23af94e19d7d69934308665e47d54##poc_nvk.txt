      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the hostname, operating system name, and local IP address of the machine it is running on. It then sends this information via an HTTP POST request to a remote server at the URL 'https://eowdq5q6u6qkhxe.m.pipedream.net/poc'. This behavior is indicative of data exfiltration, where potentially sensitive information about the victim's machine is transmitted without explicit user consent. The obfuscated function and variable names suggest an attempt to hide the code's true purpose. The remote endpoint is a Pipedream URL, which is commonly used for capturing and inspecting HTTP requests, often by attackers or researchers. Overall, this code acts as a simple spyware or reconnaissance tool that leaks system information to an external server, which can be used for malicious purposes such as profiling the victim's environment for further attacks.",
