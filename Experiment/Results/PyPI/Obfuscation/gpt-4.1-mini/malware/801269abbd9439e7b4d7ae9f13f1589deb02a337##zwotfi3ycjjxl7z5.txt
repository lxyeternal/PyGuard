      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'tser4.exe' from a Discord CDN URL and writes its content into a batch file named 'tser.bat'. It then executes this batch file using os.system. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to download and run potentially harmful executables on the victim's machine without their consent. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further suggests an attempt to hide its true purpose. Executing unknown binaries can lead to system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
