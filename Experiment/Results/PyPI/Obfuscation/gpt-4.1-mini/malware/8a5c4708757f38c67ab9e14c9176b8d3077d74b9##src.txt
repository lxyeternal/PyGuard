      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('trex.exe') from a remote URL and saves it locally as 'launcher.exe'. It then executes this file using os.system and deletes it afterward. This behavior is typical of a dropper or downloader malware, which fetches and runs potentially harmful executables without user consent. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious activity such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The code itself does not verify the integrity or safety of the downloaded file, making it a security risk.",
