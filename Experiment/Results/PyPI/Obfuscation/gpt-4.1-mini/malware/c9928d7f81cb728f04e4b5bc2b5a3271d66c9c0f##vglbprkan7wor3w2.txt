      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to stealthily extract saved passwords from the Google Chrome browser on a Windows machine. It accesses the Chrome 'Login Data' SQLite database, decrypts stored passwords using Windows DPAPI and AES-GCM with the Chrome encryption key, and writes the credentials (website URL, username, and password) to a local file named 'passwords.txt'. Then, it sends this file to a remote attacker-controlled Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive user credentials without consent. After sending, it deletes the local copy of the password file to cover its tracks. This behavior constitutes a credential-stealing malware, which can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts, identity theft, and other security breaches.",
