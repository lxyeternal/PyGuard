      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated and encoded payload that is executed at runtime. Specifically, it uses base64 decoding and dynamic execution (__import__('builtins').exec(__import__('builtins').compile(__import__('base64').b64decode(...)))) to run hidden code. The decoded payload downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/bcexv/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This behavior is characteristic of a remote code execution backdoor or downloader, which can fetch and run arbitrary code from the internet without user consent. Such functionality is malicious because it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or payloads on the victim's machine, potentially leading to compromise, data theft, or further malware installation. The rest of the code appears to be obfuscated and related to terminal display and color formatting, likely to hide or disguise the malicious intent. The presence of system calls, obfuscation, and remote code execution confirms the code is malicious.",
