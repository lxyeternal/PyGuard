      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding to hide its true functionality. It uses eval with encoded strings, base64 decoding, and dynamic imports to execute hidden code. The code decodes a large base64-encoded payload and then executes it, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to conceal payloads such as backdoors, malware, or unauthorized remote code execution. The obfuscation and use of eval on decoded data strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful operations without easy detection. This behavior is typical of malicious code aiming to evade analysis and perform unauthorized actions on the host system.",
