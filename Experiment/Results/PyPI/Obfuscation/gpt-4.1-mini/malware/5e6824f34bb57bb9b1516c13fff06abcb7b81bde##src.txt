      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits clear signs of malicious behavior. It attempts to install a large number of Python packages, some of which are commonly used for system interaction, clipboard access, cryptography, and network communication (e.g., pyperclip, pycryptodome, win32gui, psutil, requests, httpx). The code then imports a wide range of modules related to system operations, cryptography, Windows registry manipulation, clipboard access, and network requests. Most notably, it contains an obfuscated payload: a large gzip-compressed and marshal-serialized byte string that is decompressed and executed at runtime. This technique is commonly used to hide the true intent of the code and evade detection. The use of modules like win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData suggests attempts to access or decrypt sensitive Windows data, such as stored credentials or tokens. The presence of clipboard access modules (pyperclip), screen capture (PIL.ImageGrab), and cryptographic libraries (AES from Crypto.Cipher) indicates potential for stealing sensitive information, capturing screenshots, or decrypting protected data. The obfuscated payload likely contains the core malicious logic, which is hidden from direct inspection. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily load and execute hidden malicious functionality that can compromise system security, steal data, and perform unauthorized actions on a Windows system.",
