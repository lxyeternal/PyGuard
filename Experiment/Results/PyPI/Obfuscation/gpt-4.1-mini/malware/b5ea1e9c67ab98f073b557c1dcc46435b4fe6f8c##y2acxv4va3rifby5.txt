      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits clear signs of obfuscation and attempts to execute dynamically generated or decoded code, which is a common characteristic of malicious scripts. Key indicators include:\n\n1. Obfuscated Variable and Class Names: The code uses nonsensical, random strings for variable and class names, which is a typical tactic to evade detection and hinder analysis.\n\n2. Use of exec and eval: The code assigns the built-in exec function to a variable and uses it to execute dynamically constructed code strings. This allows the script to run arbitrary code that may be hidden or encoded within the script.\n\n3. Encoded and Compressed Data: There are large byte strings passed as arguments (e.g., to the method EwoOqqHfmEqcnNWAwdNUQfdBTTIPjooA) that appear to be compressed or encoded data. This data is likely decompressed and executed at runtime, which is a common method to hide malicious payloads.\n\n4. Dynamic Import and Execution: The code dynamically imports modules (e.g., zlib) and uses globals and eval to execute code constructed at runtime, further obscuring its true behavior.\n\n5. Attempts to Access and Modify Globals: The code manipulates globals and uses complex expressions to access and execute code, which can be used to inject or run malicious payloads.\n\n6. The presence of URLs and usernames in variables (e.g., github.com/billythegoat356/Hyperion) suggests this code may be part of or related to a known malware or hacking tool named 'Hyperion'.\n\nOverall, the code is designed to hide its true intent and execute potentially harmful code dynamically, which is a hallmark of malicious software. Without fully decoding and executing the hidden payload (which is unsafe), the structure and techniques used strongly indicate malicious behavior aimed at executing unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system.",
