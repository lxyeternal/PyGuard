      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and character substitution to hide its true functionality. It first decodes a large base64-encoded string, then applies a complex character mapping to transform the decoded string, and finally executes the resulting code using exec(). This technique is commonly used to conceal malicious payloads. Although the exact payload is not directly visible due to heavy obfuscation, the use of exec() on dynamically decoded and transformed data strongly indicates malicious intent. Such code can execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or system compromise. The obfuscation and dynamic execution are typical characteristics of malware or backdoors designed to evade detection.",
