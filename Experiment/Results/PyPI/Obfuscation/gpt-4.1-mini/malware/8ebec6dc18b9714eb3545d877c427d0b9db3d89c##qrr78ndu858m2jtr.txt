      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and decoding to hide its true functionality. It imports the base64 module and then executes a decoded and transformed string using exec(). The code includes a complex mapping and decoding process that reconstructs a large block of code from an encoded string. Such obfuscation is a common technique used in malicious scripts to evade detection and analysis. Given the extreme obfuscation, the use of exec() on decoded data, and the lack of any legitimate or clear functionality, this code is almost certainly malicious. It likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoor installation. The exact payload cannot be determined without fully decoding and deobfuscating the entire content, but the structure and techniques used strongly indicate malicious intent.",
