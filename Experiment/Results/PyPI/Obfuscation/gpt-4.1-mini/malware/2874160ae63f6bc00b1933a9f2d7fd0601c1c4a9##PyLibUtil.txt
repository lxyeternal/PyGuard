      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Windows users, specifically designed to extract sensitive information from browsers, Discord clients, and other applications. It performs the following malicious actions:\n\n1. **Token Stealing:** It searches for Discord authentication tokens in various Discord and browser storage locations, validates them, and collects detailed user information (username, email, phone, badges, billing info, friends list) via Discord API calls.\n\n2. **Password and Cookie Theft:** It accesses browser databases (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) to extract saved passwords and cookies by decrypting them using Windows DPAPI and AES-GCM with the browser's master key.\n\n3. **File and Folder Exfiltration:** It scans user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files and folders with keywords related to accounts, passwords, secrets, wallets, and uploads these files to anonymous file hosting services.\n\n4. **Data Exfiltration:** All stolen data (tokens, passwords, cookies, files) is uploaded to a remote Discord webhook URL, allowing the attacker to receive the victim's sensitive data in real-time.\n\n5. **Process Interference:** The code forcibly terminates certain processes (e.g., browsers, Telegram) to access locked files for zipping and exfiltration.\n\n6. **Persistence and Evasion:** It attempts to install missing Python modules silently and uses multiple threads to speed up data collection.\n\nOverall, this code is a fully featured information stealer (often called a 'stealer' or 'infostealer') that compromises user privacy and security by stealing credentials, tokens, and sensitive files, then sending them to an attacker-controlled server. Its purpose is to enable unauthorized access to victim accounts and potentially financial theft or further exploitation.",
