      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically decodes and executes a base64-encoded payload that performs the following actions: it imports modules to create a temporary file, then uses urllib to download and execute code from two suspicious URLs (http://20.226.18.203/grab/ry2K1CIVRSFa59vT and http://20.226.18.203/clip). The downloaded content is executed as Python code, which is a clear indication of remote code execution. This behavior is malicious because it allows an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation.",
