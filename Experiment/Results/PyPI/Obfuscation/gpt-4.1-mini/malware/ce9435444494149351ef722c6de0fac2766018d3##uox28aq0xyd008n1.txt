      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the machine's node name, the current user, the current working directory, and a hardcoded string \"xcryptography_2.6.1\". It encodes this information in base64, then further encodes it into hexadecimal chunks with some randomization. The encoded data is then sent out via multiple network requests (HTTP GET and POST) to suspicious external domains \"deliverycontent.online\" and its subdomain \".sub.deliverycontent.online\". Additionally, the code attempts to ping these constructed domain names, likely as a form of covert data exfiltration or command-and-control signaling. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of multiple methods to send data out (urllib, requests, os.system ping) indicate an attempt to evade detection. This behavior is consistent with malware performing data exfiltration or beaconing to a command-and-control server, which can lead to privacy breaches, unauthorized data access, or further compromise of the infected system.",
