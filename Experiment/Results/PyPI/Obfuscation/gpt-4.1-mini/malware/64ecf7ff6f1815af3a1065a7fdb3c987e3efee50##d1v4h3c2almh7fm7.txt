      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains an obfuscated and encoded payload executed at the very beginning via a base64-decoded string passed to builtins.exec and compile. This payload downloads and executes code from a remote URL (http://51.103.210.236:80/inject/VSpinLJKHaPMTkic) using urllib.request.urlopen and executes the response content. This behavior is characteristic of a remote code execution backdoor or downloader, which can fetch and run arbitrary code from an attacker-controlled server. Such functionality is malicious because it allows the attacker to run any code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to system compromise, data theft, or further malware installation. The rest of the code appears to be a complex, obfuscated set of classes and functions mostly related to terminal display and color formatting, likely to disguise the malicious intent or to provide a user interface for the malware. The initial remote code execution is the key malicious behavior.",
