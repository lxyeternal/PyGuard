It then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.call. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, which fetches and runs potentially harmful executables from the internet without user consent or verification. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious actions such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The use of a suspicious URL and execution of an unknown binary makes this code highly dangerous and malicious.",
