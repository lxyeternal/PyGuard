      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code uses multiple layers of obfuscation to hide its true functionality. It imports the 'marshal', 'zlib', and 'base64' modules dynamically and then decodes, decompresses, and unmarshals a large base64-encoded, reversed byte string. This technique is commonly used to conceal malicious payloads or code from static analysis and casual inspection. The final step is executing the decoded and unmarshalled code with 'exec', which can run arbitrary Python code. Such behavior is typical of malware, backdoors, or other harmful scripts that aim to evade detection and execute hidden malicious actions. Without fully decoding and analyzing the payload, the obfuscation itself strongly indicates malicious intent, as legitimate code rarely uses such complex hiding methods.",
