      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses the 'marshal' module to load and execute a serialized code object via exec(m.loads(...)). This technique is commonly used to obfuscate the actual code and hide its behavior from casual inspection. The presence of the 'requests' module import suggests that the code might perform network operations, such as sending or receiving data from a remote server. The obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern strongly indicate malicious intent, as it attempts to conceal its true functionality. Such code could be used to download and execute further malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, or perform unauthorized actions on the host system.",
