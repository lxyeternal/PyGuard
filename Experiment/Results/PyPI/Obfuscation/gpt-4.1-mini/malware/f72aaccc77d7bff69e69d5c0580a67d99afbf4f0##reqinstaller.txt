      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a remote URL (hosted on Discord's CDN) and saves it to a temporary file on the local system. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.call. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, which fetches and runs potentially harmful executables without user consent or verification. The downloaded executable could perform any malicious activity such as installing malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Running unknown executables from the internet poses a significant security risk.",
