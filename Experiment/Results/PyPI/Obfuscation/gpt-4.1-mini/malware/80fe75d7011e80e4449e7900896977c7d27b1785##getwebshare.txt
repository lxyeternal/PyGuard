      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains multiple layers of obfuscated and encoded data, which are decoded and executed at runtime using marshal, base64, and zlib modules. The code imports numerous modules, including networking and Telegram client libraries, and defines asynchronous functions that execute hidden payloads when triggered by specific Telegram events or commands (e.g., the 'webshare' command). The obfuscated payloads likely contain malicious instructions, such as sending files, executing arbitrary code, and deleting messages, which are typical behaviors of malware or backdoors. The extensive use of obfuscation and dynamic code execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, aiming to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions on the host system or within Telegram chats.",
