      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a malicious SSH server that accepts any username and password without real authentication, effectively allowing unauthorized access. It listens on TCP port 2222 and uses Paramiko to create an SSH server with a generated RSA key. Upon client connection, it accepts all authentication attempts unconditionally and opens an interactive shell-like session that echoes back all input. The server logs accepted credentials (username and password) to the console, which can be used to harvest credentials. The server does not execute any commands but provides a fake shell prompt, potentially to keep the connection alive or to trick users. This behavior can be used for credential harvesting, unauthorized access, and possibly as a command-and-control server or a honeypot to capture attacker credentials. The obfuscated variable and method names suggest an attempt to hide the code's true purpose.",

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module with a suspiciously obfuscated name and immediately executes it as a callable. This pattern is commonly used to hide malicious payloads or actions. Since the module name is non-descriptive and the code does not provide any context or transparency, it is highly likely that the imported module contains malicious behavior such as executing unauthorized commands, data exfiltration, or other harmful activities. The immediate invocation without any checks or logging further suggests an attempt to stealthily run potentially harmful code.",
