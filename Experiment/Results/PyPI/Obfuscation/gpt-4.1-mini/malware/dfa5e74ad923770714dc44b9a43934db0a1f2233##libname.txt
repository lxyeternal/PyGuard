      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious and functions as a credential and information stealer targeting Windows systems. It performs the following harmful actions:\n\n1. **System and Network Information Gathering:** The code collects detailed system information including hostname, local and public IP addresses, MAC address, geolocation data, CPU, memory, disk, and network usage statistics.\n\n2. **Discord and Browser Token Stealing:** It attempts to locate Discord and various Chromium-based browser data directories (Discord, Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex) and extracts Discord tokens and browser cookies using regex patterns. It also uses the 'browser_cookie3' library to steal cookies from browsers.\n\n3. **Chrome Password Extraction:** The code copies Chrome's 'Login Data' SQLite database, decrypts stored passwords using Windows DPAPI and Chrome's AES encryption keys, and collects saved passwords.\n\n4. **Data Exfiltration:** All collected data, including system info, tokens, passwords, and geolocation, is sent to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive user data to an attacker-controlled server.\n\n5. **Additional Features:** The code attempts to take a screenshot of the victim's desktop, save it, and include it in the exfiltrated data.\n\n6. **Cleanup:** It deletes temporary files used during the stealing process to cover tracks.\n\nOverall, this code is designed to stealthily harvest sensitive credentials and system information from victims and send it to an attacker, constituting a serious security threat.",
