      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using multiple layers of encoding and decoding, including hex escapes, base64 decoding, and dynamic evaluation via eval and compile. It dynamically imports modules and decodes a large encoded payload, which is then executed. The obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern strongly indicate malicious intent. Such code is typically designed to hide its true functionality, evade detection, and execute unauthorized or harmful actions such as downloading malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. The exact payload is encoded in a large base64-like string and then decoded and executed, which is a common technique in malware to conceal malicious payloads. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at executing hidden, potentially harmful operations on the host system.",
