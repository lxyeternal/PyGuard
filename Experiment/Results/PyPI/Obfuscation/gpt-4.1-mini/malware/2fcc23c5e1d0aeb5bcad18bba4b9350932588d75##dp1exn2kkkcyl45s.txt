      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is obfuscated by encoding a Python script in base64 and then decoding and executing it at runtime. The decoded script constructs a URL by converting lists of ASCII codes to characters, concatenating them, and then performs an HTTP GET request to that URL. It then writes the content of the HTTP response to a file with a randomly generated name and a '.exe' extension in the system's temporary directory. Finally, it executes this downloaded file using a subprocess call. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper malware, which fetches and runs an executable from a remote server without user consent. The purpose is likely to silently download and execute malicious payloads, potentially compromising the system. This is a clear indication of malicious intent and behavior.",
