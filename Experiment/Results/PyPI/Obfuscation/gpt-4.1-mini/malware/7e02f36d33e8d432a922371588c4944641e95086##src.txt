      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to steal sensitive user information from Discord accounts. It takes an authorization token (auth) and uses it to query the Discord API endpoint for the user's billing/payment sources, which can contain sensitive payment information. It then sends a POST request to a remote webhook URL (decoded from base64) with a JSON payload containing the user's Discord username, avatar URL, user ID, email, phone number, operating system, and billing information. This behavior is typical of malicious token grabbers or information stealers that exfiltrate private user data to an attacker-controlled server, potentially leading to account compromise, financial theft, or privacy violations.",
