      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports everything from a relative module named 'src_file' and then calls a function with a highly obfuscated and nonsensical name 'BLjYHfiqHHwywpomDxBxBcUZfnZbGadr'. The use of obfuscated function names is a common tactic in malicious code to evade detection and analysis. Additionally, the code imports 'colorama', which is typically used for colored terminal output but is not used explicitly here, possibly to disguise the code's intent or to prepare the environment for outputting deceptive or misleading information. Without the source of 'src_file', the exact behavior cannot be fully determined, but the pattern strongly suggests that the code is designed to execute hidden or harmful operations, such as unauthorized data access, code execution, or system manipulation. Therefore, this code is considered malicious due to its obfuscation and suspicious structure.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive wallet-related files from the user's 'exodus' cryptocurrency wallet directory and other common user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It compresses these files into a zip archive named after the user and then sends this archive along with a message containing the victim's username and geolocation information (IP address and country) to a remote attacker-controlled Telegram bot via Telegram's API. This behavior constitutes a wallet stealer malware, aiming to exfiltrate cryptocurrency wallet data, which can lead to theft of cryptocurrency assets. The code uses obfuscated variable names and attempts to silently handle file access errors, indicating an intent to evade detection. Overall, this code is malicious and poses a significant security risk to affected users.",
