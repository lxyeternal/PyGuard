      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of decoding and dynamic evaluation to execute hidden payloads. It starts by defining variables through obfuscated calls to eval and string decoding functions, including base64 decoding and custom transformations. The code constructs and executes a large block of encoded data that is decoded at runtime. This behavior is typical of malicious scripts attempting to hide their true functionality. The use of eval on decoded strings, manipulation of byte sequences, and dynamic execution of decoded content strongly indicates that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful operations. Such operations could include downloading and executing malware, stealing data, or compromising the host system. Due to the obfuscation and dynamic execution, the exact payload is not trivially visible, but the structure and techniques used are consistent with malicious intent.",
