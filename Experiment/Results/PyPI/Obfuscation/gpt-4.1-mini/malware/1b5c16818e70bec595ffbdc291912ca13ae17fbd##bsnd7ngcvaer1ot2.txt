      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that replaces the system's 'ls' binary located at /usr/local/bin/ls with a file downloaded from a remote IP address (159.89.160.135). Specifically, it renames the original 'ls' binary to 'ls_101', downloads a new 'ls' executable from the remote server, saves it to /usr/local/bin/ls, and makes it executable. This behavior is malicious because it effectively installs a potentially harmful or backdoored binary in place of a common system utility, which can be used to execute arbitrary code, hide malicious activity, or compromise system integrity. The obfuscated function name and the use of a direct IP address for downloading further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
