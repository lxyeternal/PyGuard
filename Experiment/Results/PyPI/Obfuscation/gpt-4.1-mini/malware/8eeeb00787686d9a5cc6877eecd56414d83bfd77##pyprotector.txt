      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is obfuscated and uses multiple layers of decoding and encoding to hide its true functionality. It dynamically reconstructs and executes code using eval, base64 decoding, and other transformations. The code imports modules like 'base64', 'codecs', 'bytes', and uses them to decode and transform a large encoded payload. The final step involves decoding and executing this payload, which is a common technique used in malicious scripts to hide the actual payload from static analysis. Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to evade detection by obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The purpose of this code is likely to execute hidden malicious payloads, which could include unauthorized code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Due to the heavy obfuscation and dynamic execution, it poses a significant security risk and should be treated as malicious.",

Such behavior is typical of malware or backdoors that attempt to execute hidden or unauthorized code on the host system. The obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly indicate malicious intent, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
