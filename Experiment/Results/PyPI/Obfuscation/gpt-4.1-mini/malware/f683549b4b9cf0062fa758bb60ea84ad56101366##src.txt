      "malicious_behavior": "This Python code is a malicious stealer malware targeting Windows systems. It collects sensitive user data including Discord tokens, browser cookies, saved passwords, and other personal information from various browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) and Discord clients. It decrypts encrypted data such as passwords and cookies using Windows cryptographic APIs and AES decryption. The malware also collects system information like IP address and geolocation. It compiles this stolen data into formatted messages and sends it to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating the victim's private data to an attacker-controlled server. The code also attempts to install required Python packages if missing, kills browser processes to access locked files, copies and reads browser databases, and searches user directories for files containing keywords related to accounts, passwords, wallets, and tokens. The presence of functions named as 'stealer', references to 'W4SP STEALER', and the use of Discord webhooks for data exfiltration confirm its malicious intent. This malware can lead to account hijacking, financial theft, privacy invasion, and further compromise of the victim's system and online accounts.",
