      "malicious_behavior": "The code checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, executes a PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag. The encoded command (Base64) is a common technique used to obfuscate the actual PowerShell payload, which is often used in malware to download and execute further malicious code or perform other harmful actions without easy detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user. This behavior is typical of malware droppers or downloaders embedded in Python packages.",
