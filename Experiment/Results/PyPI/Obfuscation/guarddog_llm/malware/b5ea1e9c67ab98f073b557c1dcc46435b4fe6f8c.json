      "malicious_behavior": "This code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. Specifically: (1) It uses obfuscated variable and function names to hinder analysis. (2) It contains code that dynamically executes code via exec and eval, including the use of __import__('builtins').exec and similar constructs. (3) It decodes and executes what appears to be compressed or encoded payloads (see the use of b'x\\x9c...' and b'Z\\x93...'), which are likely to be zlib-compressed malicious code. (4) There are lambda functions that decode and execute code using eval and compile, with strings like '\\x65\\x76\\x61\\x6c' (eval), '\\x63\\x6f\\x6d\\x70\\x69\\x6c\\x65' (compile), and so on, which are classic obfuscation techniques to hide the real intent. (5) The code attempts to execute code from globals() and uses dynamic code execution in several places. (6) The code structure and patterns are consistent with known Python malware droppers/loaders, such as the 'Hyperion' malware family. All these are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
