      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which are commonly used in malware to hide execution and obfuscate the payload. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and runs additional malicious payloads. The use of exception handling to suppress errors and the presence of a decoy setup() call further indicate attempts to evade detection.",
