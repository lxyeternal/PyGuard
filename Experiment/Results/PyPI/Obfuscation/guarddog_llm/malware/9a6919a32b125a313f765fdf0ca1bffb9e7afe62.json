During installation (via the custom install and develop commands), it performs the following actions: (1) Searches the filesystem for .env files and the user's SSH private key (~/.ssh/id_rsa), (2) Reads the contents of these sensitive files, (3) Base64-encodes their contents, and (4) Exfiltrates the data to a remote server (http://65.1.221.11:1337/) using curl via subprocess. The code is heavily obfuscated with random variable names, but the intent is clear: to steal secrets and credentials from the victim's machine during package installation.",
