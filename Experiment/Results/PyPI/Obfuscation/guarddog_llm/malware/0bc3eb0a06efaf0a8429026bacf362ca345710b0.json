The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, which is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to run potentially harmful code without the user's knowledge. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to mimic a legitimate Python package.",
