      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads three executable files from a local HTTP server and writes them to the Windows Temp directory. It then executes one of these files (Alistener.exe) using subprocess.Popen. Downloading and executing binaries from a remote source is a common technique used by malware to deliver and run payloads on a victim's machine. The use of obfuscated function and argument names, as well as the triggering of this behavior during the 'install' phase of a Python package, further indicates an attempt to evade detection and execute malicious code during package installation.",
