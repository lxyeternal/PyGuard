This is achieved by overriding the install command in setuptools with a custom class (sdXRuCdeKXgcumXQuMMImmIKVItaPSEo) that calls the function ktvrDyFbLiRWrxbErfaawQsOiKiQaoUi, which performs the download and execution. This behavior is highly indicative of a trojan or malware dropper, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent.",
