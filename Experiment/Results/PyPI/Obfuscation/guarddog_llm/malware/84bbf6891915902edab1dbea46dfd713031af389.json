It defines a custom setuptools install command that, upon installation, writes a Python script ('remote-access.py') to the user's home directory. This script contains code to open a reverse shell to the IP address 10.3.0.95 on port 4444 using bash and TCP. The installer then attempts to execute this script in a subprocess. This behavior is a classic example of a backdoor, allowing remote attackers to gain shell access to the victim's machine. The use of os.system with a bash reverse shell command is a well-known attack technique.",
