The PowerShell command is encoded and obfuscated, which is a common technique used by malware to evade detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to run a command without user visibility. The encoded payload appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious external domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior.",
