      "false_positive_reason": "The code overrides the setuptools install command, which is a common technique in malicious packages, but the overridden run() method only resolves a base64-encoded domain name to an IP address and calls a harmless test() method that prints 'Testing!'. There is no code execution, data exfiltration, or network communication beyond DNS resolution. The use of base64 encoding for the domain name is suspicious and could be used to obfuscate malicious behavior, but in this case, the code does not perform any harmful actions. The detection is likely a false positive due to the cmdclass overwrite and obfuscated string, but the actual behavior is benign.",
