(2) It downloads a suspicious executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and executes it using os.system('start ...'), which is a classic method for delivering and running additional malware payloads. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, ensuring it runs automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strong indicators of a malicious Python package.",
