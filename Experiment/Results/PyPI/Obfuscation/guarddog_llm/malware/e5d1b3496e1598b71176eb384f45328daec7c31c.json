During installation (or build), it downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded external IP address (http://77.91.77.31:6382/versions/{python_version}.zip), masquerading as a legitimate Python package host by setting the Host header to 'files.pythonhosted.org'. It then extracts the ZIP to a temporary directory and executes a Python script (main.py) from the extracted contents using the system's Python interpreter. This allows arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source, which is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution. The code also attempts to clean up after itself to avoid detection. These behaviors are not consistent with legitimate package installation and are highly indicative of a supply chain attack or backdoor.",
