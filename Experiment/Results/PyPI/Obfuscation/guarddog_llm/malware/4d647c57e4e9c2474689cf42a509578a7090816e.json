      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. Decoding the base64 string reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and runs additional malicious payloads. The use of 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' and 'WindowStyle Hidden' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user.",
