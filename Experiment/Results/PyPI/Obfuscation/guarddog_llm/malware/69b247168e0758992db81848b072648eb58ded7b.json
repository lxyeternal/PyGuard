The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, but decoding it reveals that it downloads and executes a file named 'Esquele.exe' from a suspicious remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...). It then runs this executable and attempts to hide its presence by using the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, often used to install backdoors, steal information, or further compromise the system.",
