The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of an attempt to download or execute further payloads without user knowledge. This behavior is consistent with malware droppers or downloaders that attempt to fetch and execute additional malicious code from the internet.",
