It then immediately executes this file using subprocess.call, suppressing all output. Placing an executable in the Startup folder ensures it will run automatically every time the user logs in, which is a common persistence technique used by malware. The downloaded file is from an untrusted source and its purpose is not disclosed, which is highly suspicious and indicative of malicious intent.",
