      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function notmalfunc() that is executed during the install process of the package (via the AfterInstall class). This function decodes and executes a base64-encoded string using os.system. The decoded payload downloads a binary (ip_checker.exe) from a remote GitHub repository and writes it to the local filesystem (C:\\Program Files\\STEALER.exe), then executes it. This is classic malicious behavior: downloading and running an untrusted executable during package installation, which can compromise the user's system. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) and the attempt to masquerade as a normal package further indicate intent to evade detection.",
