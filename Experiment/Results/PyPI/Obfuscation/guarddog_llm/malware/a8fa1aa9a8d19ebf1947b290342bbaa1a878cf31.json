(2) It downloads a suspicious executable (python-install.scr) from an external site (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as ini_file_pyp_41.exe, and then executes it using os.system('start ...'). This is a classic pattern for delivering and running malware payloads. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, meaning it will execute automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strong indicators of malware.",
