      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and likely downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, attempting to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window and encoding the command. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors and the presence of a decoy setup() call further indicate attempts to disguise malicious activity.",
