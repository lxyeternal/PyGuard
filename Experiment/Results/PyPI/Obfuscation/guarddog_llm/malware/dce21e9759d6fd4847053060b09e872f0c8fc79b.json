The command is base64-encoded and is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, hidden window, and encoded command is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py metadata) to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
