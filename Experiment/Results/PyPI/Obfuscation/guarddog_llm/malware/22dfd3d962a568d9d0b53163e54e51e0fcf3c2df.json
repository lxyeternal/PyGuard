It then exfiltrates this data by sending it as a JSON payload to a remote server whose URL is obfuscated using base64 encoding. The code also contains logic to avoid execution on certain hostnames or when run from specific filenames, which is a common evasion technique in malicious code. The use of obfuscated variable names and encoded URLs further indicates an attempt to hide its true purpose.",
