The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. Decoding the base64 string reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594004/Esquele.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads.",
