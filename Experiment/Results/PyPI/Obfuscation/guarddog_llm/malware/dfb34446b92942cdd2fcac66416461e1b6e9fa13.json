The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious remote URL (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then attempts to execute it. This is a clear example of a downloader/dropper, which is a common malware behavior.",
