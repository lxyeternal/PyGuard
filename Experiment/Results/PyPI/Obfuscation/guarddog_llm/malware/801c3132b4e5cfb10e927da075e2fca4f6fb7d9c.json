The command is run with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which are common techniques used by malware to evade detection and run commands without user visibility. The payload appears to download or execute additional code from a remote server (as indicated by the encoded string containing a URL). This behavior is typical of malware droppers or downloaders, which are used to fetch and execute further malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (encoded PowerShell, misleading variable names, and error suppression) further indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
