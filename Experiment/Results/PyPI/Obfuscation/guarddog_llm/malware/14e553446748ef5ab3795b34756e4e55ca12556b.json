      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then exfiltrates this information to remote servers under the attacker's control (j0j0.xyz) via HTTP GET requests. Furthermore, it attempts to read potentially sensitive files (/etc/debconf.conf, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts) and uploads their contents to the same remote server using HTTP POST requests. This behavior constitutes credential and data exfiltration, and the use of obfuscated class and variable names is a common tactic to evade detection. The code is designed to run automatically upon installation, making it especially dangerous in a supply chain attack scenario.",
