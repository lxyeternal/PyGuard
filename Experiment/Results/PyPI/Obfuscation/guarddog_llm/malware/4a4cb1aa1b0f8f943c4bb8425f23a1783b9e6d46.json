      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, and is executed via the exec() function. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making it difficult to detect the actual behavior statically. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic code execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
