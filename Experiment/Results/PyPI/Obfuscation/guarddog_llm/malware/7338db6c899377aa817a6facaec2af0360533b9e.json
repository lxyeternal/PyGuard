      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, executes a function that connects to a remote server (IP: 134.209.85.64, port 8080) and spawns a shell (/bin/sh) with its input/output redirected to the remote socket. This is a classic reverse shell, allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated function and class names, as well as the abuse of the setuptools installation process, further indicate an attempt to evade detection and execute code without the user's knowledge.",
