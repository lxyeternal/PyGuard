      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW is intended to hide the execution from the user. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
