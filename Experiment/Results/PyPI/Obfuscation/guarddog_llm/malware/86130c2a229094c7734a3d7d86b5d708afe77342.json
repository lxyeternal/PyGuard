The command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest. This is a classic technique used by malware to download and run additional payloads without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, hidden window, and encoded command is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code also tries to evade detection by only running if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist and suppresses all exceptions.",
