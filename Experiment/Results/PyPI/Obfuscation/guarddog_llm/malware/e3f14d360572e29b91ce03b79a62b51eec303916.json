      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is classic dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and run additional malicious payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand is a known technique to evade detection. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py metadata).",
