      "malicious_behavior": "The code is heavily obfuscated using exec and chr/map to hide its true intent. Upon deobfuscation, it is clear that the code downloads and executes a remote Python script from 'https://pastebin.pl/view/raw/e0db51a5' and writes it to a file in the user's home directory (WindowsDefender.py), then executes it using compile/exec. It also removes the file after execution. This is a classic pattern of a downloader/dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of obfuscation, remote code fetching, and execution without user consent is highly indicative of malicious behavior.",
