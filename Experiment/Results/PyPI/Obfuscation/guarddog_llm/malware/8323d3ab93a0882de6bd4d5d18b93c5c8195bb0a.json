The command is base64-encoded and is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute payloads without user knowledge. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand and -WindowStyle Hidden flags is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution in a stealthy manner. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup function) to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
