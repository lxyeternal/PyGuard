It then exfiltrates this data by sending it to a remote server (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response) via an HTTP POST request. The use of obfuscated variable names and the inclusion of /etc/passwd content (which contains user account information) are strong indicators of malicious intent, as this is a common technique used in information-stealing malware.",
