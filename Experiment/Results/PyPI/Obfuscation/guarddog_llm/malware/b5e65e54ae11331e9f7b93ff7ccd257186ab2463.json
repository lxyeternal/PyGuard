      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, executes a function that establishes a reverse shell. Specifically, it connects to a remote server at 134.209.85.64:8080, redirects standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawns a shell (/bin/sh) using the pty module. This allows a remote attacker to gain shell access to the system where this package is installed. The use of obfuscated function and class names, as well as the abuse of the setuptools installation process, are common techniques in Python malware.",
