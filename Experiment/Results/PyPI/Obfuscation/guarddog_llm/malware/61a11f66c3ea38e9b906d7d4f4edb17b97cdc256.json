      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command (YFmeYfvIHZZIZCszXQbgvgnTeWhNCqeZ) for the setuptools setup.py script. During installation, if the operating system is Windows, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet (a symmetric encryption library) to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and decrypted with a hardcoded key. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making it difficult to detect the actual behavior without decrypting the payload. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
