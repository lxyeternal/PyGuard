This behavior is triggered automatically during the installation or development process of the Python package by overriding the install and develop commands in setup.py. This is a classic technique used by malicious Python packages to infect systems during package installation. The downloaded executable could perform any action on the victim's machine, including stealing data, installing backdoors, or other malicious activities. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, which is another indicator of malicious intent.",
