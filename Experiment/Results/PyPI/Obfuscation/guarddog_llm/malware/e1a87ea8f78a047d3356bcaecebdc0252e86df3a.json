      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to infect systems with additional malware. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to avoid user detection.",
