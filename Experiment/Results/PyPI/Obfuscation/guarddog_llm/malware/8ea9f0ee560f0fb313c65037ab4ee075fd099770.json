During the installation or build process (triggered by 'install' or 'bdist' in argv), it downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded, non-standard IP address (http://77.91.77.31:6382/versions/{version_info[0]}{version_info[1]}.zip), disables SSL verification, extracts the contents to a temporary directory, and then executes 'main.py' from the extracted files using 'pythonw.exe'. This allows arbitrary code execution from an external, untrusted source, which is a classic pattern for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. The use of obfuscated variable names and the attempt to masquerade as a legitimate package further indicate malicious intent.",
