The payload is not visible in plaintext, making its intent opaque and highly suspicious. The use of encrypted, runtime-decrypted code executed during package installation is a common technique for hiding malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or other unauthorized actions. This behavior is not typical or necessary for legitimate Python packages and is a strong indicator of malware.",
