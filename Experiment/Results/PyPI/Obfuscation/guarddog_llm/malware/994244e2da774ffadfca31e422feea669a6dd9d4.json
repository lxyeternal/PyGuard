      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary Python file containing a payload that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/c24j2/raw) using urllib and exec. It then attempts to execute this file using a modified Python executable name (replacing .exe with w.exe), which is a common evasion technique. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper, which is a typical component of malware. The use of exec on remote content is highly dangerous and allows arbitrary code execution from an external source.",
