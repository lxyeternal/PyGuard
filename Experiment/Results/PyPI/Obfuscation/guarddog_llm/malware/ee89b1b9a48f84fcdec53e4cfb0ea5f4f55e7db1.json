      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when the package is installed, attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to the hardcoded IP address 49.233.121.53 on port 54. The code uses base64 encoding to obfuscate the IP and port, then creates a socket connection, duplicates the file descriptors for stdin, stdout, and stderr to the socket, and finally spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) connected to the remote host. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the Python process. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package.",
