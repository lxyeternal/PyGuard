The .ROBLOSECURITY cookie is a session token that can be used to hijack a user's Roblox account. The code accesses the Windows registry to extract this cookie, parses it, and sends it to a hardcoded Discord webhook, which is a common method for attackers to receive stolen data. This is a classic example of credential theft and exfiltration malware.",
