The PowerShell command is encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is a classic pattern of a downloader/dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand are further indicators of malicious intent, as they are often used to evade detection.",
