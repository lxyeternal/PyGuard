It then encodes this data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://129.226.195.123/v/...). This is a classic example of data exfiltration, where potentially sensitive information is sent to an attacker-controlled server without user consent. The use of a hardcoded IP address and the lack of any legitimate reason for this network communication further indicate malicious intent.",
