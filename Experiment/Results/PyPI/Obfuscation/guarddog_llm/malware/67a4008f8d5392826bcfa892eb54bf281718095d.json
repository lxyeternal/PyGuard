      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and contains multiple layers of dynamic code execution. Specifically, it constructs and executes code using eval and compile, with the following pattern: globals()['eval'](globals()['compile'](globals()['str'](...))). It also decompresses and executes large blobs of binary data, which are likely to be additional payloads or malicious modules. The use of builtins.exec, zlib decompression, and dynamic code execution is a hallmark of malware, especially in Python. The code is intentionally obfuscated to evade detection and analysis, and the structure is consistent with known Python malware droppers/loaders. The setup.py section is a decoy, and the real payload is in the obfuscated code.",
