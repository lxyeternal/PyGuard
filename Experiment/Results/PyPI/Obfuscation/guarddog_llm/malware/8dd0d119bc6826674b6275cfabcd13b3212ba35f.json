      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to steal Discord authentication tokens from the victim's computer and exfiltrate them to an external location. Specifically: (1) It searches for Discord and browser LevelDB files in various locations on the victim's system, which is a common method for extracting Discord tokens. (2) It uses regular expressions to extract potential Discord tokens from these files. (3) It validates the tokens by making authenticated requests to the Discord API. (4) It retrieves a webhook or exfiltration URL from a remote location (https://rentry.co/23azs/raw), which is a common tactic to avoid static detection and allow the attacker to change the exfiltration endpoint at any time. (5) It sends the stolen tokens to the attacker via a POST request. The code is heavily obfuscated with random variable names and unnecessary threading, which is also a common trait of malicious code. There is no legitimate reason for a program to search for and exfiltrate Discord tokens in this manner.",
