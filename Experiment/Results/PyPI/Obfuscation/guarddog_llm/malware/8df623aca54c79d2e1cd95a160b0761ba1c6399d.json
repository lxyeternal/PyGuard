After execution, it attempts to clean up by deleting the original files and removing the directory. This behavior is characteristic of a dropper or loader, which is a common malware technique to deliver and execute additional malicious payloads on a victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names, the creation of a suspiciously named directory, and the execution of untrusted binaries from the internet are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
