      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This behavior is consistent with malware that downloads and executes additional payloads from the internet, potentially compromising the system.",
