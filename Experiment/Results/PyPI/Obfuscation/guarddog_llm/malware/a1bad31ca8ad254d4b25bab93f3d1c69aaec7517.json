It searches for LevelDB files in the local storage directories of Discord, Discord variants, and several browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex), extracts potential Discord tokens using regular expressions, and sends the results to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This is a classic example of a Discord token stealer, which is a well-known form of credential theft malware.",
