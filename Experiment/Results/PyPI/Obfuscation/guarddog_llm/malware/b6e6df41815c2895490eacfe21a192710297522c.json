(2) On Windows systems, it downloads an executable file (ini_file_pyp_41.exe) from an external source (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and executes it using os.system('start ...'), which is a classic method for delivering and running additional malware. (3) The malicious logic is triggered during the package installation process by overwriting the setuptools install command, ensuring the payload runs automatically when the package is installed. These behaviors are consistent with common Python malware techniques.",
