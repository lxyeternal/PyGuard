      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary Python file that, when executed, downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/m3qfu/raw) using urllib and exec. It then launches this file using a system call that attempts to run the Pythonw interpreter (by replacing .exe with w.exe in the current Python executable path), which runs Python scripts without a console window. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or stager, which is a common technique in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads from the internet. The use of obfuscated variable names and the attempt to hide execution (using pythonw) further indicate malicious intent.",
