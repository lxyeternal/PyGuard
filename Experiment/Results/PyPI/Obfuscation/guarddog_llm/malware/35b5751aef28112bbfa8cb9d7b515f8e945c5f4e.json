      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It implements a remote access trojan (RAT) as part of a Python package's installation process. Specifically, during installation, it writes a Python script (remote-access.py) to the user's home directory, which contains code to connect to a hardcoded remote IP address (120.76.194.25) on port 20080. Once connected, it provides a remote shell to the attacker, either via cmd.exe on Windows or /bin/bash on Linux, redirecting standard input/output over the network socket. The install command is overridden to execute this script in a subprocess, granting the attacker remote command execution capabilities on the victim's machine. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package.",
