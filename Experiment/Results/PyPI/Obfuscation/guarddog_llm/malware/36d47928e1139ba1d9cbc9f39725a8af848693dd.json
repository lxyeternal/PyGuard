Specifically, it collects the hostname and IP address of the machine where the package is installed and sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This is a classic example of an information-stealing behavior, as it exfiltrates system information to an external server without user consent. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
