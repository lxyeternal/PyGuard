It collects extensive system information, including OS details, network configuration, public IP, current working directory, username, and hostname, by executing system commands. It then exfiltrates this data to an external Slack webhook using a curl POST request. The use of obfuscated variable names and the placement of this logic in a custom setuptools install command (which will execute automatically during package installation) are strong indicators of intent to evade detection and perform unauthorized data exfiltration. This is a classic example of a malicious Python package designed to steal host information upon installation.",
