Both the environment variables and the file listing are then sent via an HTTP POST request to an external server ('http://pt.traktrain.com/req.php?test'). This exfiltration of potentially sensitive information (environment variables and file names) to an external server is a clear indicator of malicious behavior, especially as it is performed outside the context of any legitimate package functionality.",
