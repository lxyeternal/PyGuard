(2) It downloads a suspicious executable (python-install.scr) from an external site (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as ini_file_pyp_32.exe, and then executes it using os.system('start ...'). This is a classic pattern for delivering and running a second-stage payload, which could be malware. (3) The code is hidden in a custom setuptools install command, meaning it will execute automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated variable names further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
