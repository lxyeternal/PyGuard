      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for setuptools that, when the package is installed, executes obfuscated code. The obfuscation is achieved by XOR-ing a long encoded string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) with a key (iOpvEoeaaeavocp), reconstructing a Python script (oIoeaTEAcvpae), and then executing it using eval(compile(..., 'exec')). This is a classic technique for hiding the true intent of the code and is commonly used in malware to evade detection. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to avoid detection or failure. The actual payload is hidden and could perform any action, including downloading further malware, stealing data, or opening backdoors.",
