The payload is not visible in plaintext, making its intent opaque and highly suspicious. This is a common technique used by malware to hide and execute malicious code during package installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data, especially in a setup script, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system.",
