The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, but decoding it reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then attempts to execute it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and run additional malicious payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to hide execution from the user.",
