      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several clear indicators of malicious behavior: (1) It fetches a URL from Pastebin and uses the response as the destination for a POST request, which is a common technique for exfiltrating data or receiving remote commands. (2) It downloads and writes the contents of a remote script from 'https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode' to a randomly named .pyw file, then immediately executes this file using subprocess.Popen. This allows arbitrary code execution from a remote source, which is a hallmark of malware and backdoors. (3) The use of obfuscated or non-standard argument names (e.g., 'ImjcgTCaiRuqxGXBYMsgakMzQULbDrlA') and the random file naming further indicate attempts to evade detection. (4) The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks in Python packages.",
