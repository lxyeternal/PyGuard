      "malicious_behavior": "This code is explicitly malicious. It attempts to extract the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library. The .ROBLOSECURITY cookie is a sensitive authentication token for Roblox accounts. The code then validates the cookie, collects user information (such as UserID, Robux balance, account age, etc.), and sends all of this data—including the cookie itself and the user's public IP address (retrieved via https://api.ipify.org/)—to a Discord webhook. This is classic credential-stealing (account hijacking) behavior, and the code is designed to exfiltrate sensitive user data to an attacker-controlled endpoint.",
