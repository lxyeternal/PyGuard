The function name and module are highly obfuscated, which is a common tactic in malicious packages to hide intent. The function is executed before the normal install process, and its contents are not shown here, but the obfuscation and execution during install are strong indicators of malicious behavior. Additionally, the package metadata (name, download_url, etc.) appears suspicious and randomly generated, which is another red flag for malware.",

This is a classic example of data exfiltration, where potentially confidential information is sent to an attacker-controlled endpoint.
