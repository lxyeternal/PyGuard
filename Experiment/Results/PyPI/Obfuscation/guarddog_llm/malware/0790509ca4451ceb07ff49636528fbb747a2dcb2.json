      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that, when triggered (e.g., by running 'python setup.py install' or 'python setup.py develop'), will download an executable file ('Cleaner.exe') from a remote server (https://a4a08d21-3950-435e-8b39-12ab7788cd10.id.repl.co/Cleaner.exe) and execute it on the victim's machine using os.system. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is hidden in a package's setup script to compromise users during installation. The use of obfuscated variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
