      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains clear indicators of malicious behavior. Specifically, it downloads files from a suspicious external server (http://52.14.229.35:1122/connect-CANDC.txt and http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg), saves them as .txt files, renames them to .bat files, and then executes them using the Windows command shell. This is a classic pattern for downloading and executing arbitrary code (potentially malware) on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names, unnecessary complexity, and attempts to install dependencies at runtime further indicate attempts to evade detection. The code also attempts to clean up after itself by deleting the .bat files after execution, which is another common trait of malware.",
