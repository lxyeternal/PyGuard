This is achieved by cloning the repository to a local directory and then running the script using subprocess.run(['python', 'bypass.py']). This behavior is commonly associated with malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malicious actions.",
