      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious because it downloads and executes a remote Python script (qrcodes.py) from an external URL (https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py) during the installation process of a Python package. This is achieved by overriding the install command in setuptools, fetching the remote file, saving it locally, and then executing it with the current Python interpreter. This behavior allows arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source, which is a common technique used in supply chain attacks and can lead to system compromise.",
