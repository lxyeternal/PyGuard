The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, making its behavior intentionally hidden and obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true functionality and evade static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data, especially during the install phase of a package, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system without the user's knowledge.",
