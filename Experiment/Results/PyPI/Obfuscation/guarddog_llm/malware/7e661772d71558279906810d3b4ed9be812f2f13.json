Specifically, it fetches a URL from https://rentry.co/2sv84/raw (a pastebin-like service often used to host payload URLs), then downloads the file to the user's Temp directory as Bin.exe, and executes it using 'start'. The use of threading to run this in the background, obfuscated variable/class names, and the use of a public pastebin to fetch the payload URL are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This is a classic pattern for a dropper or loader malware.",
