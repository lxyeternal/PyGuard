The command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686871742350131/1079749475150594048/Esquele.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, often used to evade detection and download further malicious payloads. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, hidden window, and encoded command are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
