(2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and then executes it using os.system('start ...'). This is a textbook example of a downloader/dropper, which can be used to deliver further malware. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, meaning it will execute automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks. All variable and class names are obfuscated, further indicating an attempt to evade detection.",
