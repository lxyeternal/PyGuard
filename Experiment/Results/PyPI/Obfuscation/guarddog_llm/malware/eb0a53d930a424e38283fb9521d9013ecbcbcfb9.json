      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It is a classic example of an information stealer (infostealer) targeting Windows systems. The code attempts to extract sensitive data such as browser passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and files with keywords like 'password', 'wallet', 'crypto', etc. It decrypts browser-stored credentials, collects them, and exfiltrates the data to a hardcoded Discord webhook (CKDOTPpnvOeZkpenfWYrCJXUtmuzSmUr). It also uploads files to transfer.sh and sends links to the attacker. The code uses subprocess to install dependencies and to kill processes (e.g., browsers or wallets) to access locked files. The use of threading, obfuscated variable names, and the targeting of specific browser and wallet data locations further confirm its malicious intent. The code is designed to run stealthily, collect as much sensitive information as possible, and exfiltrate it to the attacker.",
