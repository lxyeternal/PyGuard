However, after deobfuscation, the code is a standard Python package setup script (using setuptools, pip, etc.) and a function to clone a GitHub repository if it does not exist locally. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or other malicious actions. The obfuscation is likely used to evade automated scanners or for intellectual property protection, but the actual behavior is benign.",
