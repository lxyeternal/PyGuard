During package installation or development, it collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the current username, hostname, and working directory. It then encodes this data and exfiltrates it via DNS queries to a remote domain (for-research.ru) controlled by the attacker. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, as well as the abuse of the setup.py installation process for data exfiltration, are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
