The command is base64-encoded and is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute payloads without user knowledge. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup.py metadata) to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
