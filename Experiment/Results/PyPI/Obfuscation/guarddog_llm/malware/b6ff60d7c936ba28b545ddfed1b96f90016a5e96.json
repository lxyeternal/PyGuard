      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. The most critical red flag is the use of eval() on dynamically decoded strings in the functions dRJxZwZRsXzrVZmgmjObApRGmcGsZONr and hZrMCgUsMSmKdGEhaNYRCsJFDEdEZoHo. These functions take an encoded string, perform a custom deobfuscation routine, and then execute the result as Python code using eval(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing arbitrary or malicious payloads at runtime. Additionally, the code uses further obfuscation by encoding strings with non-ASCII characters and shifting them, making static analysis difficult. The presence of __import__ and getoutput in a print statement, with the module name and command being dynamically decoded and executed, is another strong indicator of code execution and possible system command execution. The overall structure, with hundreds of meaningless variable assignments and obfuscated logic, is typical of malware attempting to evade detection.",
