This is done only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to run potentially harmful or unauthorized code without user knowledge. The rest of the script is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
