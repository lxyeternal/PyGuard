During the installation process (via the custom install command class BSezcwfpnGmajusrNvNOQepEOaYCsHjd), it executes the function tWrwWUyGUQedmPMPTlATFRuFrCvAJAoD. This function collects sensitive information from the host system, including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the system hostname (via os.uname()), and the local path of the package. It then encodes this information in base64 and exfiltrates it to a remote server (https://kotko.org) via an HTTP GET request. This is classic data exfiltration behavior, commonly seen in malicious Python packages. The use of obfuscated variable names and the triggering of this behavior during package installation further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
