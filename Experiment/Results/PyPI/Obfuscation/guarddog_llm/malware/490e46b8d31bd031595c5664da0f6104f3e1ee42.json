      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when the package is installed, executes a reverse shell payload. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner that connects back to the hardcoded IP address 13.93.28.37 on port 1337, giving the remote attacker a shell on the victim's machine. The payload is base64-encoded and then executed via os.system using bash, which is a common technique to evade simple string-based detection. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package.",
