      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains a custom install command (InstallCommand) that, during package installation, executes an obfuscated payload. The payload is stored as an XOR-encrypted string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) and a key (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). The code decrypts the payload at runtime and executes it using eval(compile(..., 'exec')), which is a classic technique for hiding and executing arbitrary or malicious code. This behavior is highly suspicious and is a common pattern in Python malware, especially in supply chain attacks via PyPI packages. The use of try/except to silently ignore errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
