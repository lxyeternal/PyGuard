It attempts to extract the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library. The .ROBLOSECURITY cookie is a sensitive authentication token for Roblox accounts. After extracting the cookie, the script validates it and, if valid, collects additional user information (Robux balance, account age, RAP, etc.) and the victim's public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org/). It then exfiltrates all this data, including the authentication cookie, to an external endpoint (the value of DwJDwdxBlFQnLNDHKrsVCxQYiNcPSmLl, which is likely a Discord webhook). This is a classic example of a credential stealer targeting Roblox users.",
