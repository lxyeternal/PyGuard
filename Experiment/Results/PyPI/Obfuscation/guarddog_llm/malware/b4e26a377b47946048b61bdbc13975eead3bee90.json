      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes a Python script into it that downloads and executes code from an external URL (https://rentry.co/ki74h/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using the system's Pythonw interpreter. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or stager, which is commonly used in malware to fetch and execute arbitrary code from the internet. The use of exec on remote content is highly dangerous, as it allows the attacker to run any code of their choosing on the victim's machine.",
