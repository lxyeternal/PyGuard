The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads from static analysis and only executing them on the victim's machine. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common indicator of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
