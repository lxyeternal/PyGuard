      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a common technique used by malware to evade user detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it, redirecting output to 'WindowsCache.exe'. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads from the internet. The use of try/except to suppress errors and the placement of this code in what appears to be a setup script further indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.",
