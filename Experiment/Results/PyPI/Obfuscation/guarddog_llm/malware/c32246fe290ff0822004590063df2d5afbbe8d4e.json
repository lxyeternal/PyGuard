The encrypted payload is hardcoded and only decrypted at install time, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and likely malicious. This is a common technique for hiding malware in Python packages, as it evades static analysis and can download or execute further malicious code at install time. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
