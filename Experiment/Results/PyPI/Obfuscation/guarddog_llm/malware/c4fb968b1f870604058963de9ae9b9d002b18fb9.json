The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for executing obfuscated or hidden payloads, often used by malware to download and execute additional code or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to invoke a web request to a suspicious URL (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), downloads a file named 'Esquele.exe', saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', and then executes it. This is classic dropper/downloader behavior, which is highly indicative of malware.",
