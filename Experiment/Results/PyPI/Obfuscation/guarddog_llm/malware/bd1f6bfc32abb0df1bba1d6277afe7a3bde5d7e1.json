      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when the package is installed (e.g., via pip), executes a shell command using os.system. The command downloads and executes a shell script from http://34.69.215.243/hi using curl and pipes it directly to bash, suppressing all output and errors. This is a classic pattern for remote code execution and is commonly used in supply chain attacks to compromise systems during package installation. The use of obfuscated class and function names further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
