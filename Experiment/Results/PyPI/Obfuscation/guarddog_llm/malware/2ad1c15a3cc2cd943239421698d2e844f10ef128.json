      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of indirection and dynamic code execution. Specifically, it constructs a chain of lambda functions and uses eval and compile to dynamically execute code that is extracted by decompressing zlib-compressed byte strings. The code at the end (NNMMNMMMNMNNNNNNMN()(S2S22222S2222222SSSS(...))) decompresses and executes a large amount of hidden code, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads. The use of builtins.exec, eval, compile, and dynamic import of zlib, combined with the obfuscation and the execution of code from compressed data, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern is commonly used in malware droppers, stealers, or remote access trojans to evade static analysis and deliver a second-stage payload.",
