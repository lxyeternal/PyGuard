      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits several clear indicators of malicious behavior: (1) It exfiltrates the victim's computer name to a remote server (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php) upon installation, which is a form of data exfiltration. (2) It downloads a suspicious executable (python-install.scr) from an external site (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and then executes it using os.system('start ...'). This is a classic pattern for delivering and executing a second-stage payload, which could be malware. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, ensuring it runs automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated variable names further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
