The PowerShell command is encoded and appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) using Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then executing it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common initial stage in malware infections. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW is intended to hide the execution from the user, further indicating malicious intent.",
