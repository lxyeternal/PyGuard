The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code, such as downloading and running additional malware, stealing information, or establishing persistence. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, as well as the execution of decrypted code during installation, are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
