The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is often used to download and execute further payloads or perform actions without user knowledge. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper malware behavior.",
