The command collects the hostname, current user (whoami), current working directory (pwd), and a detailed directory listing (ls -la), and sends them as HTTP headers and POST data. This is a clear example of data exfiltration, which is a common malicious behavior. Additionally, the use of obfuscated variable and function names further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",

In its custom install method (iVTdjprjtwnsmwLWzrxATilcCkKHtdXJ), it calls a function RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb imported from a module named pre_install. The function is executed before the standard install process. The function and module names are highly obfuscated, which is a common tactic in malicious code to evade detection and hinder analysis. The actual behavior of RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb is unknown from this file, but the pattern of executing arbitrary code during installation is a well-known vector for malware in Python packages. The use of a suspicious download_url and meaningless package name further increases suspicion.",
