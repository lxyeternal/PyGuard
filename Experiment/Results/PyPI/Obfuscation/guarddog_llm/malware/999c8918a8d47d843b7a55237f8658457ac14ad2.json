      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains clear indicators of malicious behavior. Specifically, the function NmgbGkblerfApfhccMAagXUABSbwGKvt establishes a reverse shell by connecting to a remote IP address (59.110.111.85) on port 8088, duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input/output/error, and then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system. The use of os.system('touch /tmp/test1563.txt') is likely a marker to prevent multiple executions. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive function and variable names, and the malicious functionality is executed automatically at the end of the script.",
