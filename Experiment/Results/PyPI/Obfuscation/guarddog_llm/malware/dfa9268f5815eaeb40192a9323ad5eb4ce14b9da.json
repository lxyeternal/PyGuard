This is done only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is often used to download and execute further payloads or perform other unauthorized actions without user knowledge. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a suspicious remote server (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then running it. This is classic downloader/dropper malware behavior.",
