It defines a function (KZtHUoOYKVwBsPiQywYJmEmdzpucYHWI) that collects all environment variables from the host system and attempts to exfiltrate them via an HTTP request to an external server (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app). The function is called both at the end of the script and is also hooked into the install and develop commands of setuptools, meaning it will execute automatically when the package is installed or developed. This is a classic example of a malicious package designed to steal sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, or other secrets stored in environment variables.",
