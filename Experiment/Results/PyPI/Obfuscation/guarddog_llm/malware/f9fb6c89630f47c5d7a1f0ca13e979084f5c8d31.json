In the custom install command (kDACqvbeLTQLEDmRVzknZKEJTudsIgyw), the function RiKYBbRvcbNMVacHQXIFWUgNeOqakfeK is registered to run at process exit (via atexit). This function collects sensitive information from the host: the public IP address (via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org').text), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the local path of the package. It then encodes this information and exfiltrates it to a remote server (https://kotko.org) via an HTTP GET request. This is classic data exfiltration behavior, often seen in malicious Python packages. The use of obfuscated variable names and the placement of this logic in a setup.py file (which is executed during package installation) further indicate an attempt to evade detection and target unsuspecting users.",
