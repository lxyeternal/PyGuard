The PowerShell command is encoded and appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) using Invoke-WebRequest, saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe', and then running it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand are both indicators of attempts to evade detection and analysis.",
