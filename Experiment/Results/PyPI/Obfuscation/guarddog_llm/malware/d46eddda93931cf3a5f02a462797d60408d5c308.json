It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to know its exact behavior without decryption, but this pattern is a classic method for hiding and executing malicious code (such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other attacks) during package installation. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and execution during install are all strong indicators of malware.",
