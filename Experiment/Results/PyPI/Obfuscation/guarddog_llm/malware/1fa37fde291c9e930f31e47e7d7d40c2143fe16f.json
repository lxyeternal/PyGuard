This means that when the package is installed (e.g., via pip), it will execute an arbitrary Python module (perlreq) on the user's system. This is a common technique used in malicious packages to execute code without the user's consent. The use of shell=True further increases the risk, as it allows for arbitrary shell command execution. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute an external module in this way, especially without user interaction or clear documentation.",
