      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for setuptools (via the cmdclass argument in setup), which is executed automatically when the package is installed (e.g., via pip). In the custom install command, it collects sensitive information from the system, including the hostname, current working directory, username, local IP addresses, and directory listings of root and home directories. It then exfiltrates this data to an external server (https://425a2.rt11.ml) via an HTTP POST request. Additionally, it attempts to resolve a DNS name constructed from the collected data, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration via DNS. The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, which is a common tactic in malicious code to evade detection and hinder analysis.",
