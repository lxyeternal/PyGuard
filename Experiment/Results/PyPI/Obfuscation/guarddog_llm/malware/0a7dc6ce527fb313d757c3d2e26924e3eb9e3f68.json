The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code, as the actual payload is not visible in the source and is only revealed at runtime. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common indicator of malware, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions.",
