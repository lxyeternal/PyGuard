      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command (AfterInstall) that, upon installation of the package, executes the function notmalfunc(). This function decodes a base64-encoded string (currently a placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE...') and passes the result to os.system(), which executes the decoded string as a shell command. This pattern is a classic method for hiding and executing arbitrary or potentially malicious code during package installation. The use of base64 encoding is a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. Even though the actual payload is not present in the provided code (it's a placeholder), the structure is clearly designed to execute arbitrary code upon installation, which is a hallmark of malicious Python packages (e.g., supply chain attacks).",
