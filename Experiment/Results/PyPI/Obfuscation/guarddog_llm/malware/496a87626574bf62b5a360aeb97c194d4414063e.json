      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom install command for a Python package that, during installation on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The payload is not visible in the source code, making its behavior intentionally hidden and obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent and evade static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data, especially during the install phase of a package, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system without the user's knowledge.",
