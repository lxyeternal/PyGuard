      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple clear malicious behaviors: (1) It exfiltrates the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable to a remote server (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ...), which is a form of data exfiltration. (2) On Windows systems, it downloads an executable file (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and then executes it using os.system('start ...'). This is a classic pattern for dropping and running a second-stage payload, which could be any form of malware. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, meaning it will execute automatically when the package is installed (e.g., via pip), making it a supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors are highly indicative of malware.",
