It collects a wide range of sensitive information from the victim's machine, including system information, geolocation, public and local IP addresses, MAC address, Windows product key, browser-stored passwords, and Discord/other browser tokens. It uses various techniques to extract and decrypt browser credentials (including Chrome's encrypted password store), and then exfiltrates all this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...). The code also attempts to take a screenshot and send it, and cleans up evidence by deleting files after exfiltration. The use of obfuscated variable names, multiple redundant imports, and the targeting of browser and Discord data are all hallmarks of credential-stealing malware.",
