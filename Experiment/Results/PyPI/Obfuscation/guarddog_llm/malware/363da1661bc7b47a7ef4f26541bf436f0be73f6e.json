      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file list from a remote server (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), filters the list based on the current operating system, then downloads and saves additional files from the same remote server. It then attempts to set execute permissions and run these downloaded files, or start them on Windows. This is classic dropper/downloader behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute arbitrary code from an external source. The use of obfuscated variable and function names further suggests an attempt to evade detection and analysis.",
