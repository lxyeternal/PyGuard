It collects sensitive system information such as the hostname and current working directory, then exfiltrates this data to an external server via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL (https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/). Additionally, it establishes a reverse shell by connecting to a remote host (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:19931) and redirects standard input, output, and error streams to this socket, then spawns a shell. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system. These are classic indicators of malware, specifically for data exfiltration and remote access.",
