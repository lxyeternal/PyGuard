The payload is not visible in plaintext, making its intent opaque and highly suspicious. This is a common technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation. The use of exec() on decrypted data, especially in a setup script, is a strong indicator of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system.",
