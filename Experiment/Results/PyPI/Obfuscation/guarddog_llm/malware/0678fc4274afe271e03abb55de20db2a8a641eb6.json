It then sends this data to an external server (https://webhook.site/284099f8-6eea-45be-9c3c-3b6b0f9ccb0e) via an HTTP GET request. This is a classic example of data exfiltration, where information is sent to an attacker-controlled endpoint without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable and class names further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
