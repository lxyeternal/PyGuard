(2) The VBScript, when decoded, executes a Python script (main.cpython-39.pyw) using the Windows Script Host (wscript.exe), which is a common technique for persistence or evasion. (3) The Python script (main.cpython-39.pyw) is also written to disk, though its content is empty in this sample, but the infrastructure is in place for arbitrary code execution. (4) The code uses obfuscated variable names and indirect execution (via Popen and shell=True), which are typical of malware attempting to evade detection. (5) The code only executes this payload during install or build, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. These behaviors together strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge.",
