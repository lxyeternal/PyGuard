This will immediately power off or shut down the user's computer when the script is run. The function rn() is called as soon as the script is executed, meaning any user running this setup.py file will have their machine forcibly shut down. This is a clear example of disruptive and malicious behavior, as it can cause data loss and disrupt user activity.",
