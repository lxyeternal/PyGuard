(2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and then executes it using os.system('start ...'). This is a textbook example of a second-stage malware dropper, which can be used to install further malicious payloads on the victim's machine. (3) The malicious logic is hidden in a custom install command class, which is triggered automatically when the package is installed, making it stealthy and effective for supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strong indicators of malware.",
