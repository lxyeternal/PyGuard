      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly suspicious and likely malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, during installation, attempts to execute arbitrary Python code in a subprocess. Specifically, it tries to import and execute code from a module named 'secrevtwo' and its 'dist_util' submodule, which is not a standard library and could contain any payload. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, as well as the silent exception handling, further suggests an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is commonly used in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code upon package installation.",
