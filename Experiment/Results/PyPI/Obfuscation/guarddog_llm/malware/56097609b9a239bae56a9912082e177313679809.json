The payload is not visible in plaintext, making its intent and actions opaque. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, and is commonly used in supply chain attacks. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and dangerous, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system.",
