It then executes the downloaded file using os.system, waits for 2 seconds, and deletes the file. This is a classic pattern for a dropper or downloader malware, which can be used to deliver and execute arbitrary malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names and the fact that the code only runs on Windows further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
