      "malicious_behavior": "This code downloads two Windows executable files (ZYXMN.exe and ZYRBX.exe) from Discord CDN URLs, saves them to a hidden system-like directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), renames them to appear as system files, and then executes both of them using os.startfile. After execution, it attempts to clean up by deleting the directory. This is a classic pattern for a dropper or loader malware: it fetches and runs potentially malicious binaries from the internet, disguises them, and erases traces. The use of 'hack' as a keyword, the suspicious directory name, and the lack of any legitimate application logic further support the malicious intent.",
