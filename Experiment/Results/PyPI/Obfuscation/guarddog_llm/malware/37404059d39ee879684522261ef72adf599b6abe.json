It then attempts to set execute permissions and run these files on the local system using os.system, which can result in arbitrary code execution. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded IP addresses, and the execution of potentially untrusted binaries are all strong indicators of malicious intent, such as remote code execution, backdoor installation, or malware delivery.",
