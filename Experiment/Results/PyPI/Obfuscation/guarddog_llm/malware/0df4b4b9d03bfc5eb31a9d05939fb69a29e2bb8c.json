      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command in a hidden window using a base64-encoded payload. This is done via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' command. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, attempting to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window and using encoded commands. The use of a try/except block to suppress errors and the check for a non-existent file ('tahg') are also common obfuscation and persistence techniques.",
