It then attempts to set executable permissions and execute these files on the local system using os.system, which can result in arbitrary code execution. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded IP addresses, and the execution of downloaded binaries are all strong indicators of malicious intent, such as establishing persistence, running malware, or further compromising the system.",
