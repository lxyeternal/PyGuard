The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads and evading static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a common indicator of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The actual behavior of the decrypted payload cannot be determined without decrypting it, but the structure and obfuscation strongly indicate malicious intent.",
