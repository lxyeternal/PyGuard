      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute a large encrypted payload via exec(). The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, making its behavior intentionally hidden and obfuscated. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true functionality and evade detection. The use of exec() on decrypted data, especially during the install phase of a package, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge.",
