The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed at install time, making its behavior intentionally obfuscated and hidden from static analysis. This is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent and bypass detection. The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system. There is no legitimate reason for a package installer to execute hidden, encrypted code during installation.",
