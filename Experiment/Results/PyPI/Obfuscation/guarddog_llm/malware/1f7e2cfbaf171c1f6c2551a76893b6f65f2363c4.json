The command is base64-encoded and is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for executing obfuscated or hidden payloads, often used by malware to evade detection. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it and deletes it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, which is highly indicative of malware.",
