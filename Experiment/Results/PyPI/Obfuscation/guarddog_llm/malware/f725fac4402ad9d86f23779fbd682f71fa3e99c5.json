The command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) using PowerShell's Invoke-WebRequest. This is a common technique used by malware to download and run additional payloads without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with a hidden window and encoded PowerShell command is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to evade detection and user awareness.",
