      "malicious_behavior": "This code overrides the setuptools install command to execute custom code during package installation. The custom install class clones two GitHub repositories (one named 'test2lmaos', another 'defonotagrabber') into the user's Windows Startup and Powerpoint Start Menu folders. It then moves a Python file into the Startup folder and attempts to execute a binary ('main.exe') from the cloned 'defonotagrabber' repository. This behavior is highly suspicious and consistent with malware: it achieves persistence by placing files in the Startup folder, downloads and executes potentially malicious code from external sources, and runs an executable without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable names and the targeting of Windows Startup folders further indicate an attempt to evade detection and establish persistence.",
