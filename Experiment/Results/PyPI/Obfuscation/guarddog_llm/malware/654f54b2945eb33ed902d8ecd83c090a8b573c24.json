It defines a custom setuptools install command (IbFgmpFEDhMzHWjhbPUawifitHTfhrae) that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current working directory, username, local IP addresses, and directory listings of root directories (such as C:\\, D:\\, /, /home). It then exfiltrates this data to a remote server (https://425a2.rt11.ml) via an HTTP POST request. Additionally, it attempts to resolve a DNS name constructed from the collected data, which could be used for tracking or exfiltration via DNS. The use of obfuscated variable names and the abuse of the package installation process to run this code further indicate malicious intent.",
