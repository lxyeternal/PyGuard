It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, local IP address, and detailed platform information (such as OS version, machine type, and processor). It then sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. This exfiltration of system information without user consent is a clear indicator of malicious intent. The use of obfuscated class and method names further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
