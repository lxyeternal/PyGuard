The base64-decoded payload, when decoded, reveals code that downloads and executes a remote payload from http://40.113.112.131/inject/8SBVnoqSQsbjlaV. It does so by writing the downloaded content to a temporary file and then executing it, attempting to hide its tracks by deleting the file afterward. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional malicious code from a remote server. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and remote code fetching are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
