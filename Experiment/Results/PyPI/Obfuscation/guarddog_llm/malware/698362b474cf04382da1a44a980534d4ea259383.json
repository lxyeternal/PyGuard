It attempts to extract the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from the user's browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, Chromium) using the browser_cookie3 library. The .ROBLOSECURITY cookie is a sensitive authentication token for Roblox accounts. The code then validates the cookie, collects user information (such as Robux balance, account age, RAP, friends, etc.), and sends all of this data—including the user's public IP address and the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself—to a remote Discord webhook. This is a classic example of a credential stealer (cookie grabber) targeting Roblox users. The code is heavily obfuscated with random variable names, which is a common tactic to evade detection.",
