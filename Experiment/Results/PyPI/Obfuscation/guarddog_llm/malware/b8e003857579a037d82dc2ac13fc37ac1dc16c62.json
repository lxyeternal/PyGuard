This function collects the public IP address of the machine (via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')), the hostname (via os.uname()), and the installation path. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it to a remote server (https://kotko.org) as a GET request. This exfiltration of environment information during package installation is a clear indicator of malicious behavior, as it leaks potentially sensitive information without user consent.",
