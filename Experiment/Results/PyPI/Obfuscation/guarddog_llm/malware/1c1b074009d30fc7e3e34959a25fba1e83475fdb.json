It collects sensitive information from the environment variables (encoding them in base64), the current username, and the machine's IP address, and then exfiltrates this data to an external server (https://eo6sl0hu84cr4pa.m.pipedream.net) via an HTTP request. The use of obfuscated variable names and the placement of the exfiltration code outside of any function (so it runs on import) further indicate intent to hide malicious activity. The code also attempts to appear benign by printing a 'security warning' message, but this is a common social engineering tactic to distract from the actual data theft.",
