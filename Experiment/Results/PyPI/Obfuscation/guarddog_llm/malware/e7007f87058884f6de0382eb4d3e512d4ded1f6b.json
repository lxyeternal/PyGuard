It defines a custom install command (ThnpbKVfhJSvuIUQwCrWZLTuNeiBRfwj) for setuptools that, during installation on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' libraries, then uses Fernet to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The use of exec() on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution at install time. The payload is hidden and only revealed at runtime, which is a common technique for evading static analysis and security tools. This behavior is typical of malware that attempts to execute additional code on the victim's machine during package installation.",
