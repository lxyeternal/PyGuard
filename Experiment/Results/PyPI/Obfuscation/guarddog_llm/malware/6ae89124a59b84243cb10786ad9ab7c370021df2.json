(2) It downloads a suspicious executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and executes it using os.system('start ...'), which is a classic malware dropper technique. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, meaning it will execute automatically when the package is installed, further indicating intent to compromise the system. The use of obfuscated variable names and silent exception handling are also common in malicious code.",
