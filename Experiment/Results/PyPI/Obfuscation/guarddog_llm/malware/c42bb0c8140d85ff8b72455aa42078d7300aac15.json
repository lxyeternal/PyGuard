The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed during installation. This is a classic technique used by malware to hide its true behavior and evade static analysis. The use of exec() on decrypted data is highly suspicious and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation.",
