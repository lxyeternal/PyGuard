      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run on Windows, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' libraries, then uses Fernet to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload. The payload is stored as a base64-encoded, Fernet-encrypted string, which is decrypted at install time and executed via exec(). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code during package installation, making it difficult to detect the actual payload via static analysis. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, as well as the execution of decrypted code, are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
