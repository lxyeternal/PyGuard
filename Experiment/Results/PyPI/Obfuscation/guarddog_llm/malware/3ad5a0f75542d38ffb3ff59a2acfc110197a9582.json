      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive information from the system (hostname, current working directory, and username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to an external domain (cdf7ymt2vtc0000eer0gggz6haayyyyyf.oast.fun). This is a classic example of data exfiltration, which is a common malicious behavior in supply chain attacks. The use of a custom install command to trigger this behavior during package installation is a known technique for hiding malicious payloads in Python packages.",
