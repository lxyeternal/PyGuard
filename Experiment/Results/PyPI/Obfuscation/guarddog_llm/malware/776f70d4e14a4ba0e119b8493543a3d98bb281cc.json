      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and likely downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common form of malware. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and EncodedCommand are both strong indicators of malicious intent, as they are used to hide execution and obfuscate the payload.",
