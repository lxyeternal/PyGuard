It then attempts to execute this file using a modified Python executable name (replacing .exe with w.exe), which is a common evasion technique. This behavior is characteristic of a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and runs remote code, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
