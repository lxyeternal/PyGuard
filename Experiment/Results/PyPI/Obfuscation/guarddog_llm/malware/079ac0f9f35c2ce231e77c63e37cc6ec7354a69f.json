      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It is a classic example of an information stealer (infostealer) targeting Windows systems. The code attempts to extract sensitive data such as browser passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and other credentials from various locations on the victim's machine. It decrypts browser-stored credentials, collects files with sensitive keywords, and uploads them to a remote server via Discord webhooks and file transfer services. The code also attempts to kill processes (e.g., browsers, wallets) to unlock files for exfiltration. The use of subprocess.Popen to install dependencies and kill processes, the presence of Discord webhooks, and the systematic search and exfiltration of credentials and files are all clear indicators of malicious intent.",
