      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains several indicators of malicious behavior. In the custom install command (class pTcStviUlVBoFyJBWLYcrlUBnrlAQWiz), it executes a base64-decoded shell command ('ioreg -k IOPlatformUUID') to extract the system's hardware UUID on macOS. It then checks if the UUID matches one of two hardcoded values, likely to target specific systems. If matched, it reads a PDF file, extracts a binary payload from a specific offset, writes it as an executable ('gomod') to a temporary directory, sets executable permissions, and then executes it in a subprocess with output suppressed. This is a classic technique for delivering and running a hidden payload during package installation, and the obfuscation (random variable names, base64 encoding, binary extraction from a PDF) is typical of malware attempting to evade detection. The use of setup.py and custom install hooks to trigger this behavior is a known supply chain attack vector.",
