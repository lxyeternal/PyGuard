      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command in a hidden window using an encoded command string. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded PowerShell command (Base64) is likely used to obfuscate its true intent, which is a hallmark of malware. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the process is hidden from the user. This behavior is typical of malware attempting to download or execute additional payloads without user knowledge.",
