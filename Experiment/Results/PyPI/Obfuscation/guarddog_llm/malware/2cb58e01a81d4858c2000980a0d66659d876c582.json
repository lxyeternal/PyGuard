The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a common technique used by malware to evade user detection. The encoded command appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), save it as 'Esquele.exe', and then run it, while also attempting to hide its presence by using the 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flag. This behavior is highly indicative of a downloader or dropper, which is a classic malware technique.",
