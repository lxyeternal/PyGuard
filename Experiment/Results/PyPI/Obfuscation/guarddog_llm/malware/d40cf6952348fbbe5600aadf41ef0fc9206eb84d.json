      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and contains multiple layers of dynamic code execution. Specifically, it uses lambda functions to dynamically call eval and exec on code that is constructed at runtime. The code also decompresses and executes large blocks of zlib-compressed data, which is a common technique for hiding the true payload of malware. The use of globals()['eval'](globals()['compile'](...)) and similar constructs is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution. The code is structured to evade static analysis and to make manual review difficult. The presence of multiple such constructs, and the fact that the decompressed payloads are executed, means this code can perform any action on the host, including downloading further payloads, stealing data, or other malicious activities.",
