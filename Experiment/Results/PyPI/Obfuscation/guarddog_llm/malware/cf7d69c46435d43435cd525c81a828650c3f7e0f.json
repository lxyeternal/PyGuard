The command is base64-encoded and is executed only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, the -WindowStyle Hidden flag, and the -EncodedCommand parameter are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The rest of the code is a decoy (a standard setup.py call) to appear legitimate.",
