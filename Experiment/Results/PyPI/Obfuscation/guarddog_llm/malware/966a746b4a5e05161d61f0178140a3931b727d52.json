The command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic technique used by malware to evade detection and run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, the hidden window, and the encoded command are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
