      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, creates a reverse shell to the remote IP address 104.248.19.57 on port 3333. It does this by creating a socket connection, redirecting standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawning a shell (/bin/sh) using pty.spawn. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the install. The use of obfuscated class and method names further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
