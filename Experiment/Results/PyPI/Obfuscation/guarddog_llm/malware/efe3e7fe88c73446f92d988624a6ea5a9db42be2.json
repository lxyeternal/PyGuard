      "malicious_behavior": "This code contains clear indicators of malicious behavior. Specifically, the function esWkCMNUNFKHQPiErbNIZFpTAKDZaimA establishes a reverse shell by connecting to a remote IP address (59.110.111.85) on port 8088, redirects standard input/output/error to the socket, and then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) using subprocess.call. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system. The use of os.system('touch /tmp/test1563.txt') is likely a marker to prevent repeated execution. The code is obfuscated with random function and variable names, which is a common tactic to evade detection.",
