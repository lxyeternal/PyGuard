The command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag to avoid user detection and uses '-EncodedCommand' to obfuscate its intent. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, attempting to evade detection and persist on the system.",
