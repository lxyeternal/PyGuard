      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which are common techniques used by malware to evade detection and run commands without user visibility. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads from the internet. The use of obfuscated variable names and the try/except block to suppress errors further indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity.",
