After execution, it attempts to clean up by deleting the directory. This is a classic pattern for a dropper or loader, which is a type of malware that downloads and runs additional malicious payloads. The use of obfuscated variable names, the attempt to install dependencies at runtime, and the use of Discord CDN (a common malware hosting location) further indicate malicious intent.",
