      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. During the installation or development process (via custom setuptools commands), it downloads a remote file (install.bat) from a Discord CDN URL using the requests library and then executes it with elevated privileges using 'set __COMPACT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker | start install.bat'. This behavior is highly suspicious and typical of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution from an external, potentially untrusted source. The use of obfuscated variable names and the triggering of this behavior during package installation further indicate an attempt to evade detection and compromise the system.",
