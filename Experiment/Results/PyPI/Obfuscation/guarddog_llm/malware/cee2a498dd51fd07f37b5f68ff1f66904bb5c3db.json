During the installation process (via a custom install command class), it collects sensitive information from the host system, including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the system hostname, and the installation path. It then encodes this information in base64 and exfiltrates it to an external server (https://kotko.org) via an HTTP GET request. This is classic information-stealing and beaconing behavior, which is not expected or justified in a legitimate package installation script. The obfuscated variable names and the use of a seemingly random package name further suggest an attempt to evade detection.",
