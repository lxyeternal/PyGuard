      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered (e.g., by running 'python setup.py install'), executes a reverse shell payload. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner that opens a reverse shell to the hardcoded IP address 13.93.28.37 on port 8888, encodes this command in base64, and then executes it via 'os.system' using 'echo ... | base64 -d | bash'. This allows an attacker to gain remote shell access to the system where the package is installed, which is a classic example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package.",
