The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW and the -WindowStyle Hidden flag further indicate an attempt to hide execution from the user. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it, which is a classic malware dropper behavior.",
