The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of an attempt to download or execute further payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
