      "malicious_behavior": "The function pgBkcOLTLCTJsJIaFqwkKjtJhdFjIAKY takes a string, performs obfuscated string manipulation and decoding, and then executes the result using eval(). This is a classic code execution backdoor pattern, where arbitrary code can be hidden in an encoded string and executed at runtime. The use of eval() on dynamically decoded content is highly dangerous and is a common technique in malware and supply chain attacks. Additionally, the code prints the result of os.system('whoami'), which is often used for reconnaissance or to test code execution in a new environment. The combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and system command invocation is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
