The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, and such behavior is typical of malware attempting to download or execute additional payloads without user knowledge. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is often used to hide execution from the user and evade detection.",
