      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. Specifically, it dynamically constructs and executes code using eval and compile, and it imports the zlib module to decompress and execute large blobs of binary data. The code uses lambda functions and string obfuscation (e.g., '\\x65\\x76\\x61\\x6c' for 'eval', '\\x63\\x6f\\x6d\\x70\\x69\\x6c\\x65' for 'compile', etc.) to hide its true intent. It also manipulates the globals() dictionary and executes code from decompressed data, which is a common technique for loading and running additional payloads or shellcode at runtime. The presence of large, compressed binary blobs and the use of dynamic code execution are strong indicators of malware, such as a loader or dropper.",
