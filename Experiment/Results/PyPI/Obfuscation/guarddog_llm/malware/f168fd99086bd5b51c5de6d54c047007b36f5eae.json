The encoded command (Base64) is a common technique used by malware to obfuscate its true intent and evade detection. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to infect systems with additional malware. The use of try/except to suppress errors and the check for a marker file ('tahg') are also common in malicious code to avoid repeated execution and detection.",
