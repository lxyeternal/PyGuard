This is done only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, which is a common technique used by malware to obfuscate its true intent and evade detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it attempts to run potentially harmful or unauthorized commands on the victim's machine without their knowledge. The rest of the code is a decoy (a standard setup() call) to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
