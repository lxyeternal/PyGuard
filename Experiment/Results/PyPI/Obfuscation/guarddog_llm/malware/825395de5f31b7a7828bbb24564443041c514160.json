      "malicious_behavior": "This code overrides the setuptools install command to execute a reverse shell upon installation. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner that opens a reverse shell to a remote host (e6j4342057.zicp.fun:26264), base64-encodes it, and then executes it via os.system('echo %s|base64 -d|bash' % ...). This will give the attacker remote shell access to the system where this package is installed, which is a classic example of a supply chain attack. The use of obfuscated variable and class names further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
