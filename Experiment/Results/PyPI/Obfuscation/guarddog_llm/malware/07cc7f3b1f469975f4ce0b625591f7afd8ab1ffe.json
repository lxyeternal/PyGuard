The obfuscation is achieved by XOR-ing two long strings to reconstruct a hidden Python script, which is then executed using eval(compile(...)). This is a classic technique used to hide malicious payloads in Python packages (often seen in supply chain attacks). The use of try/except to suppress errors and the absence of any legitimate reason for such obfuscation in a setup script further indicate malicious intent. The actual payload is hidden and could perform any action, such as data exfiltration, backdoor installation, or other harmful activities.",
