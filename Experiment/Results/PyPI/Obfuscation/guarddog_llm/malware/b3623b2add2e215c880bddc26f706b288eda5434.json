It defines a custom setuptools install command (ANiTLtMqAuyEWjduPFGfMebXtTLMLJSz) that, when the package is installed, executes the function LubXuzuKJfaqkbYArlioXYmCUGTPZvNP. This function collects sensitive system information, including OS details, platform, version, and the host's IP address, as well as the system uptime. It then establishes a socket connection to a remote server at 134.209.85.64:9090 and sends the collected information. This is classic exfiltration behavior, commonly seen in malware and backdoors, and is executed automatically upon package installation, making it particularly dangerous.",
