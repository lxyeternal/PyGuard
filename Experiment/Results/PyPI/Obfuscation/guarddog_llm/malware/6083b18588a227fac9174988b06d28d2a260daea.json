      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It is a classic example of an information stealer (infostealer) targeting Windows systems. The code attempts to extract sensitive data such as browser passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and wallet files from various locations on the victim's computer. It uses subprocess to install dependencies if missing, and forcibly kills processes (e.g., browsers) to access locked files. Stolen data is exfiltrated via Discord webhooks and file upload services (e.g., gofile.io). The code also searches user directories for files with sensitive keywords (e.g., 'password', 'wallet', 'crypto'), uploads them, and sends links to the attacker. The use of obfuscated variable names, threading for parallel data theft, and the presence of a Discord webhook for exfiltration are all strong indicators of malware.",
