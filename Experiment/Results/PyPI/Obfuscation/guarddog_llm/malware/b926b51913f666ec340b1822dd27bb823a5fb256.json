      "malicious_behavior": "This code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It uses confusing variable and function names, lambda chains, and dynamic code execution via exec and eval. Notably, it stores and manipulates large byte strings (likely compressed or encrypted payloads) and then decodes and executes them at runtime. The code also uses globals(), __import__, and compile to dynamically load and execute code, which is a common technique in malware to evade static analysis. The presence of suspiciously named variables and the use of builtins.__import__('zlib') suggest that it may decompress and run additional payloads. The code is designed to hide its true purpose and make analysis difficult, which is a hallmark of malicious software.",
