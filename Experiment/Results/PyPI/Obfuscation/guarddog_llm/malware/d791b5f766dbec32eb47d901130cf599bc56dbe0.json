The decoded payload downloads and executes code from a remote server (http://wasp.plague.fun/inject/ISUP8AVHicLUbvIS), writing it to a temporary file and attempting to execute it as a process. This is a classic pattern for a remote code execution backdoor, allowing arbitrary code to be run on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64, indirect exec) and the network activity to fetch and run remote code are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
