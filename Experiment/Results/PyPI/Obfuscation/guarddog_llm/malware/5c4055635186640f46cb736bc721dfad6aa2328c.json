It defines a custom install command (mxnADBfMzUeBBwkZDuzHNYskFGjZErgb) for setuptools that, during installation on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' libraries, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute an encrypted payload via exec(). The payload is not visible in plaintext, but the use of exec() on decrypted data is a common technique for hiding and executing malicious code (such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions) during package installation. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of supply chain attacks in Python packages.",
