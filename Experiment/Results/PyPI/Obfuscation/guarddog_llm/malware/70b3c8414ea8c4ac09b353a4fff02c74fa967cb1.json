This is done only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The use of subprocess.Popen to launch PowerShell with the -EncodedCommand flag and hidden window strongly indicates an attempt to download or execute further malicious payloads without user knowledge. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup script) to appear legitimate.",
