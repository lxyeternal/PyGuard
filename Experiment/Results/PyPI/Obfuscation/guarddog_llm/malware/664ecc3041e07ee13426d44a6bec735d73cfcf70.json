After execution, it attempts to clean up by deleting the temporary directory. This is a classic pattern for a dropper or loader, which is a type of malware that downloads and runs additional malicious payloads. The use of Discord CDN for payload hosting, the obfuscated variable names, and the attempt to hide files in a system-like directory further indicate malicious intent.",
