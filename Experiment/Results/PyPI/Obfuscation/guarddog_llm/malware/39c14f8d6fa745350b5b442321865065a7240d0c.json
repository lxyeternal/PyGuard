      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and likely downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to hide the execution and obfuscate the payload.",
