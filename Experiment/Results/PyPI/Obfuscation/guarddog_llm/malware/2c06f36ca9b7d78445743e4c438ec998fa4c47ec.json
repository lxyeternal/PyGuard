(2) On Windows systems, it downloads an executable file (python-install.scr) from a suspicious remote server (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and then executes it using os.system('start ...'). This is a textbook example of a downloader/dropper, which can be used to deliver further malware. (3) The malicious logic is hidden in a custom install command class, which is triggered during package installation, making it stealthy and likely to be executed without the user's knowledge. All these behaviors are strong indicators of a malicious Python package.",
