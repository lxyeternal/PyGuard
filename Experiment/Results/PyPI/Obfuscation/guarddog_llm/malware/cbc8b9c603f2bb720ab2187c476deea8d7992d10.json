The encoded command (Base64) is a common technique used to obfuscate malicious payloads. The command downloads a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then executes it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, often used to infect systems with additional malware. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote code retrieval are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
