      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, executes the function JoPoNsZuQfYCJoMAteyUYoXWGWEZvGBd. This function collects system information (uptime, OS details, platform, IP address) and then opens a socket connection to the external IP address 134.209.85.64 on port 9090, sending the collected information. This is classic information-stealing behavior, and the use of obfuscated variable and class names further suggests an attempt to evade detection. The code is designed to execute automatically upon package installation, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks.",
