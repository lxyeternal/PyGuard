It then changes the permissions of this file to make it executable and executes it using './node'. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source. The use of obfuscated function names and the lack of any legitimate reason to execute a remote binary further indicate malicious intent.",
