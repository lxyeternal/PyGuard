It then executes this file using subprocess.call. This behavior is characteristic of malware, as it allows arbitrary code to be fetched and run on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated variable names and the lack of any legitimate reason to download and execute a remote binary further indicate malicious intent.",
