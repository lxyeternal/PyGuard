This is done only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, which is a common technique used by malware to obfuscate its true intent and evade detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it attempts to run potentially harmful or unauthorized code without the user's knowledge. The rest of the script is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
