      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding, compression, and dynamic code execution. Specifically, it uses eval and exec to dynamically execute code that is constructed at runtime from decoded and decompressed data. The code sets up built-in functions with obfuscated names to further hide its behavior. The use of base64, zlib, and codecs to decode and decompress data, which is then executed, is a common technique in malware to hide the true payload from static analysis. The presence of eval(''.join(chr(i) for i in [101, 120, 101, 99])) is a clear indicator of dynamic code execution. The code also manipulates __builtins__ to add new functions, which can be used to further obfuscate or escalate privileges. All these are strong indicators of malicious intent, such as downloading and executing further payloads, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
