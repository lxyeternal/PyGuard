(2) The code uses exec(f.read(), ...) to execute the contents of an external file (__version__.py) at install time, which is a common technique for code injection or running arbitrary code. (3) The code is heavily obfuscated, with random class and variable names, making it difficult to audit and suggesting an attempt to hide its true purpose. (4) There are suspicious custom setuptools command classes that start threads to run further obfuscated functions, which may execute additional hidden payloads. (5) The use of pyarmor and encrypted blobs is a known technique to hide malicious logic. These behaviors are not typical for legitimate Python package setup scripts and indicate a high risk of malicious intent.",
