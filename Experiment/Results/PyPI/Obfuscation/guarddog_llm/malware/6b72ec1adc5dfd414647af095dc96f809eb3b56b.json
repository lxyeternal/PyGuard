It defines a custom install command for a Python package (by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install) and overrides the installation process to execute a block of base64-encoded Python code. When the package is installed (e.g., via pip), the install command will decode and execute this payload. The decoded payload attempts to create directories and execute commands on the victim's Windows system, including downloading and running a remote executable (from a Discord CDN link) and launching it with high privileges. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package.",
