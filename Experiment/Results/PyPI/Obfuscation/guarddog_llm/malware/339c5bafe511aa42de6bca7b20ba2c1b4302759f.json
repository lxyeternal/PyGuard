      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command in a hidden window using an encoded command string. The command is base64-encoded and, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, hidden window, and encoded command is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code also checks for the existence of a file named 'tahg' as a simple persistence or execution guard, which is another common malware technique.",
