      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information, including the machine's hostname, full platform details, current working directory, and network interface information (via 'ifconfig'). It then encodes this data in base64 and exfiltrates it to a remote server (http://1.15.77.2/v/...) using an HTTP GET request. This is a clear case of data exfiltration. Additionally, the code executes an external script or file (whose path is constructed as 'ver') using subprocess.Popen, which could be used to run arbitrary code. These behaviors are typical of malicious software designed to steal information and potentially execute further payloads.",
