This is done only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a well-known method for running obfuscated or hidden commands, often used in malware to download and execute further payloads or perform malicious actions without user knowledge. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to invoke PowerShell to download and execute a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), save it as 'WindowsCache.exe', and then execute it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior.",
