It defines a custom setuptools install command that, upon installation of the package, executes a function (GBwRufjygwGFwWgtjAaswNCQubhsPLym) registered with atexit. This function collects the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host, base64-encodes it, and sends it as a query parameter to a remote server (https://stark-mesa-88610-1b7520139d14.herokuapp.com/logo.png). It then downloads the response and writes it to a file named 'logo.png' in the package directory. This behavior constitutes exfiltration of host information and remote code/data retrieval during package installation, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks and is not expected in legitimate package setup scripts.",
