The code attempts to extract sensitive data from the victim's machine, including browser passwords, cookies, Discord tokens, and files with keywords related to accounts, passwords, and cryptocurrency wallets. It exfiltrates this data to a Discord webhook (hardcoded in the variable kYovKQASGKDKNXizsDulUfrgXAVLhxVV) and also uses transfer.sh for file uploads. The code forcibly kills processes (e.g., browsers, wallets) to access locked files, installs dependencies at runtime, and uses obfuscation and random variable names to evade detection. The presence of functions to search for and steal credentials, cookies, and tokens, and the exfiltration to an external server, are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
