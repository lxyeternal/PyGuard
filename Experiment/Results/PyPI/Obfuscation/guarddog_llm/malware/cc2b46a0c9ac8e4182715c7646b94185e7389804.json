      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly obfuscated and contains several indicators of malicious behavior. Specifically: (1) It uses obfuscated variable and function names to hinder analysis. (2) It dynamically executes code using exec and eval, including code that is constructed at runtime from obfuscated strings. (3) It imports the 'zlib' module via obfuscated lambda functions and appears to decompress and execute additional code at runtime. (4) The code manipulates globals() and uses compile() and eval() to execute code that is likely hidden in the compressed byte strings (e.g., the long b'...' blobs). (5) The code includes suspicious logic to extract and execute code from variables with names like 'nnnmmmmnnnmnmmnnnmnm' and 'SSSS222S2SSSS2SSS222', which are likely used as keys to store and retrieve malicious payloads. (6) The use of __import__('builtins').exec and similar tricks is a common technique in malware to evade static detection. (7) The code is designed to run additional payloads that are not visible in the static source, making it likely to be a loader or dropper for further malicious activity.",
