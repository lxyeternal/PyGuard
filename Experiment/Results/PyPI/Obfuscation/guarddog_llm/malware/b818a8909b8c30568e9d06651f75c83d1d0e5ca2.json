      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It overrides the install and develop commands of setuptools to execute a function (GWkViygaMhonDeaYzKKQevxcOmqgXLPC) during package installation or development. This function, when run on Windows, downloads a file from a remote server (whose URL is dynamically fetched from another remote server), saves it to the user's Startup folder as 'Update.exe', and then attempts to execute it. This ensures the downloaded executable will run on system startup, which is a common persistence technique used by malware. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic URL fetching, and silent exception handling further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis.",
