      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a common technique used by malware to evade user detection. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe', then runs it and deletes it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads from the internet. The use of exception handling to suppress errors and the placement of this logic in a setup script further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis.",
