It defines a custom setuptools install command (ktcHHQELopWFibicUMvicOcoXxKDADOZ) that, when the package is installed (e.g., via pip), executes the function KfnAlmHeICsZHjcHbDjNmEFYTUHPDqeK. This function collects system information (uptime, OS details, IP address) and then establishes a socket connection to a hardcoded remote IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090, sending the collected information. This is classic information-stealing behavior, and the use of obfuscated variable and class names further suggests an attempt to evade detection. The code is designed to execute automatically upon package installation, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks.",
