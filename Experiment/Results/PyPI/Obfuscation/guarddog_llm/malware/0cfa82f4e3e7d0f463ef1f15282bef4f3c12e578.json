This is done via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' command. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1031686717423501312/1079749475150594048/Esquele.exe), saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, often used to evade detection and run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and non-standard argument names) further indicates malicious intent.",
