Upon decoding, the payload downloads and executes code from a remote server (http://20.226.18.203/grab/ry2K1CIVRSFa59vT and http://20.226.18.203/clip) using Python's urllib and exec. It writes the downloaded content to a temporary file, attempts to execute it, and then cleans up. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common type of malware. The use of exec, dynamic code execution, and remote code retrieval are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
