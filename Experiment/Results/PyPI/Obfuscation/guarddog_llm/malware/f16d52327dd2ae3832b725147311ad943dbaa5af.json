This is a classic example of a 'canary token' or exfiltration beacon, which is often used to notify an attacker when the code is executed (such as during package installation). This behavior is not expected in legitimate Python package setup scripts and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it leaks information about the environment where the code is run.",
