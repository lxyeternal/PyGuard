It collects this data from various browser and Discord client locations, decrypts it, and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1075015307749511168/zW0wmO7PoeePt7LvQtnGFt44j1dG2YmJwnzkhKsO5HeRUoQ_2ImSLyoLJP3TlKqGILWA) and to transfer.sh. The code also attempts to install missing dependencies at runtime, kills processes, and searches the user's Desktop, Downloads, and Documents for files containing sensitive information. The use of exec, subprocess with shell=True, and the exfiltration of sensitive data to an external server are all clear indicators of malicious intent.",
