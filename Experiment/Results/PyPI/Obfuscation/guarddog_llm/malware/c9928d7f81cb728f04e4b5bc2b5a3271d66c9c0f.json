It locates the Chrome 'Login Data' SQLite database, decrypts stored credentials using Windows APIs and Chrome's local state encryption key, writes the credentials to a file, and then uploads that file to a Discord webhook controlled by the attacker. The use of obfuscated variable names, direct access to sensitive browser data, and exfiltration to a third-party service are all clear indicators of credential theft malware.",
