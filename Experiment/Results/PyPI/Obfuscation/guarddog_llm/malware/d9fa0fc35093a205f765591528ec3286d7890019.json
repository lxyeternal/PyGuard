It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to an external server (http://123.206.22.33:5000/p/). This is a classic example of data exfiltration, which is a common malicious behavior. The code also attempts to avoid repeated execution by creating a marker file in the system's temporary directory, which is a common technique to evade detection and reduce noise. There is no legitimate reason for a package installation script to exfiltrate this kind of information to an external server.",
