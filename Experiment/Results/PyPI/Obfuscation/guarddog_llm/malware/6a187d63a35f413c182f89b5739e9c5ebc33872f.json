      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It is a classic example of an information stealer, specifically targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data. The code collects credentials and sensitive files from various browsers and applications, decrypts stored passwords and cookies, and exfiltrates them to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...). It also uploads files to transfer.sh and sends links to the attacker. The code attempts to install dependencies if missing, kills processes (e.g., browsers or wallets) to access locked files, and uses threading to speed up data theft. The code is heavily obfuscated with random variable names, but its intent is clear: to steal and exfiltrate as much sensitive information as possible from the victim's machine.",
