It then encodes this data in base64 and exfiltrates it to a remote server (http://1.15.77.2/v/...) using an HTTP GET request. This is a classic data exfiltration technique. Additionally, the use of subprocess.Popen to execute a potentially suspicious file ('version') is another red flag, as it could be used to execute arbitrary code.",
