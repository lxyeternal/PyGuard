      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered (e.g., by pip install), executes a reverse shell payload. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner that connects to a remote host (e6j4342057.zicp.fun) on port 26264, redirects standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawns a bash shell. The payload is base64-encoded and then executed via os.system('echo %s|base64 -d|bash'), which decodes and runs the shell command. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing a reverse shell, giving an attacker remote access to the system. The use of setup.py and setuptools for this purpose is a known supply chain attack vector.",
