      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed at runtime using built-in functions (exec, compile, base64.b64decode). The decoded payload imports modules for file and process manipulation (tempfile, sys, os, subprocess), writes a Python script to a temporary file, and executes code that downloads and runs additional code from a remote server (http://20.224.2.213//inject/ctE6toLDoHBbJApj) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or remote code execution backdoor, which is highly malicious. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, dynamic imports, and exec) further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
