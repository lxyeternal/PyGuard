      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It collects sensitive information from the system, including the current username (via 'whoami') and the user's home directory (via 'echo $HOME'). It then exfiltrates this information to a remote server (http://3.221.152.203:8000) using curl commands executed via os.popen. The exfiltration is hidden by redirecting output to /dev/null. The code is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, meaning it will execute automatically when the package is installed, making it a form of supply chain attack. The use of obfuscated variable and class names further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
