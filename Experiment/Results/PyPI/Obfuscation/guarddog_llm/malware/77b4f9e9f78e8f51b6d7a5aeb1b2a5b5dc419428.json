It defines a custom install command (rXLKMXvsXuqbEpJNTsudcDHTwIPKcQAX) for setuptools that, when run (such as during pip install), will execute a function (ghXAKCZdVkhvfwjnmKOOCRVvAwWcDDef). This function checks if the OS is Windows, then imports requests and Fernet, and executes code that is decrypted at runtime using Fernet. The encrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to know what it does without decryption, but this is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true behavior. The use of exec on decrypted data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation.",
