It then executes this file using subprocess.call. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common technique used in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads from the internet. The use of obfuscated variable names and the lack of any legitimate reason to execute a remote binary further indicate malicious intent.",
