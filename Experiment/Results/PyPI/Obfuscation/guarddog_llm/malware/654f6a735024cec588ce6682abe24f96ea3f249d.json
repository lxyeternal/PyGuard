The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique for running obfuscated or hidden commands, often used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', and then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of a downloader or dropper malware.",
