This is done only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of an attempt to download or execute further malicious code, likely from a remote server (as suggested by the encoded URL in the command). The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, and the rest of the file is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
