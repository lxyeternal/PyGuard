This is done in the function RzDZaoDiOUCaLAgPeqdXpLBIKwoXTXLR, which is called during package installation, development, and egg_info commands by overriding setuptools command classes. This exfiltration of environment variables can leak sensitive information such as credentials, API keys, and other secrets. The use of obfuscated function and class names further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
