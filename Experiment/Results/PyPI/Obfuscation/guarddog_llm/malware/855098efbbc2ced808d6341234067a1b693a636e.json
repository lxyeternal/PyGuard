      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file (DigitalPulse.exe) from an external URL (https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe) and executes it automatically on Windows systems during the installation process of the Python package. This is achieved by overriding the install command in setuptools with a custom PostInstallCommand class that calls the app() function, which performs the download and execution. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware, as it can be used to deliver and run arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent.",
