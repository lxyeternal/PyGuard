Specifically, it collects the hostname and IP address of the machine where the package is being installed and sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This is a clear example of exfiltrating system information without user consent, which is a common trait of malicious Python packages (often seen in supply chain attacks). The obfuscated class and function names further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
