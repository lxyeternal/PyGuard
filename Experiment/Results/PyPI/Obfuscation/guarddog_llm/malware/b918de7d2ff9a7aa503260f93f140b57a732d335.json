This endpoint returns an access token for the VM's service account, which can be used to access Google Cloud APIs with the VM's privileges. The code then sends this sensitive token to an external server (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log) via an HTTP POST request. This is a clear attempt to exfiltrate cloud credentials, which is a common tactic in cloud-focused attacks and is considered highly malicious.",
