This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution. The use of a Discord CDN link is a common tactic for hosting malicious payloads. The code does not perform any validation or user interaction, and the downloaded executable could perform any action on the victim's machine.",

This is classic dropper behavior: it fetches and runs potentially malicious binaries from the internet, which is a common technique used by malware to infect systems. The use of obfuscated variable names, the creation of a suspiciously named directory, and the execution of unknown binaries all strongly indicate malicious intent.",
