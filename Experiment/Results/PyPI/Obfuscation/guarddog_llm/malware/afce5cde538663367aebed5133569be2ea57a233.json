      "malicious_behavior": "The function QjuiGUnHwoMunSOCudrWWCedDwZjidMK collects the current username (via getuser()) and an arbitrary message, then sends this data as a JSON payload to a remote server (https://search.upgini.com/private/api/v2/events/send-light) using an HTTP POST request. This exfiltration of potentially sensitive information (the username and possibly other context) to an external server without user consent or clear documentation is a classic indicator of malicious or at least highly suspicious behavior. The function is called at the start and end of the setup process, and also in the exception handler, ensuring that information is sent regardless of success or failure. The use of obfuscated variable and function names further suggests an attempt to hide the true purpose of the code.",
