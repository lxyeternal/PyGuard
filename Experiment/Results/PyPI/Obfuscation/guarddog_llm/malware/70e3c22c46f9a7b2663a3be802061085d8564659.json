The PowerShell command is encoded and likely downloads and executes a file from a remote server (as indicated by the presence of a URL in the decoded string). This is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to hide the execution from the user.",
