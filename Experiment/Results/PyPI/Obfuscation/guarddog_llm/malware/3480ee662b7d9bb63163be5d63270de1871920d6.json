The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of an attempt to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized code on the system without user knowledge. The rest of the code is a decoy (a setup() call for a fake package).",
