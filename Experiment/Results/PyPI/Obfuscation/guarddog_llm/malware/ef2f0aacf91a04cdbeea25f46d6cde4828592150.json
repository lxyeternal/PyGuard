      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW and -WindowStyle Hidden ensures the command runs without user visibility. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com), which is a classic indicator of malware attempting to fetch and run additional payloads. This behavior is highly suspicious and consistent with malware delivery and execution tactics.",
