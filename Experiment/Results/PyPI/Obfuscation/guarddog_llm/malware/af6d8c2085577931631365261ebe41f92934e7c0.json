This is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, as it exfiltrates information or signals to an external server controlled by an attacker. The use of a Discord webhook is a common technique for attackers to receive notifications or stolen data. The code also uses obfuscated parameter names and a try/except block to suppress errors, which are further signs of malicious intent.",
