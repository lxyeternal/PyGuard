      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a custom install command (InstallCommand) that, during package installation, decodes and executes an obfuscated payload using eval(compile(..., 'exec')). The payload is stored as an XOR-encrypted string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) with a key (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). This is a classic technique for hiding and executing arbitrary or malicious code at install time, which can be used to download and run malware, steal data, or perform other harmful actions without the user's knowledge. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. This behavior is highly suspicious and matches common patterns of Python package supply chain attacks.",
