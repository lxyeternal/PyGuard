The command is base64-encoded and is executed only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user knowledge. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell, the -WindowStyle Hidden flag, and the -EncodedCommand parameter are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code is also wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection, which is another common tactic in malicious scripts.",
