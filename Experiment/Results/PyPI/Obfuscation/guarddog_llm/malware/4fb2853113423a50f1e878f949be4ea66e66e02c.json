The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its activity from the user. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads from the internet. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hidden window, and non-standard argument names) further indicates malicious intent.",
