This is done only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute potentially harmful payloads without user knowledge. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, which is highly indicative of malware.",
