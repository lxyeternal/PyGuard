The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute arbitrary or potentially harmful commands without user knowledge. The encoded command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), save it as 'Esquele.exe', and then run it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, which is highly indicative of malware.",
