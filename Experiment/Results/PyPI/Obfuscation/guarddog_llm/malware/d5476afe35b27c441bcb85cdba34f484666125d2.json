This is done via subprocess.Popen with the 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' command. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbu0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, attempting to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window and using encoded commands.",
