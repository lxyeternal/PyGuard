The content of these binaries is opaque and likely to be malicious payloads. (2) It attempts to remove /bin/netstat and /usr/bin/netstat, which is a common technique to hinder network forensics and monitoring. (3) It creates or appends a specific SSH public key to authorized_keys files in /root/.ssh, /home/user/.ssh, and /home/$USER/.ssh, granting the attacker persistent SSH access to the system. (4) It sets the permissions of these authorized_keys files to 0600 (owner read/write), ensuring the attacker's key remains usable. All these actions are typical of post-exploitation malware or backdoors.",
