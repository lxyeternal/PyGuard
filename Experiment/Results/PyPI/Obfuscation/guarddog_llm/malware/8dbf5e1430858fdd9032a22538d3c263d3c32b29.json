The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a common technique used by malware to evade user detection. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, which is highly indicative of malware.",
