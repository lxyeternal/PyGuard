It decodes and decompresses hardcoded, obfuscated strings to obtain hostnames and endpoints, then makes outbound HTTPS requests to those endpoints. It collects the current username (via getlogin()), and sends it along with other data (including an obfuscated string 'e', an integer 't', and a string 'v') to a remote server using a POST request with a JSON payload. The use of obfuscation (reversed base64+zlib, map(chr, ...)), dynamic endpoint resolution, and exfiltration of local user information are all strong indicators of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration or C2 communication.",
