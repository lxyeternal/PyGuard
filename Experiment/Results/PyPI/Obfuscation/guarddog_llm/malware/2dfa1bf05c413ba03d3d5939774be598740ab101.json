It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed (e.g., via pip), executes the function WNvrhmWWGPScRBBlklPaINkgzQlfCihM. This function collects sensitive system information, including system uptime, OS details, platform information, and network interface addresses. It then establishes a socket connection to the hardcoded IP address 134.209.85.64 on port 9090 and exfiltrates the collected data. This is classic information-stealing and exfiltration behavior, triggered automatically during package installation, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks.",
