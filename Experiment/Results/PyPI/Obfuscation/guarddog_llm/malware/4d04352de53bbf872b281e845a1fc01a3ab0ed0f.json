(2) It uses subprocess to download a shell script (seo.sh) from a remote server (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/seo.sh), saves it as 'gay.sh', makes it executable, and runs it. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. (3) The use of obfuscation (nonsensical variable names, encoded payloads) is a strong indicator of intent to evade detection. These behaviors together are characteristic of malware or a trojanized package.",
