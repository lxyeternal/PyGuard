The command is base64-encoded and is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with PowerShell's -EncodedCommand and -WindowStyle Hidden flags is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to evade detection and run code stealthily. The rest of the code is a decoy (a setup() call for a fake package).",
