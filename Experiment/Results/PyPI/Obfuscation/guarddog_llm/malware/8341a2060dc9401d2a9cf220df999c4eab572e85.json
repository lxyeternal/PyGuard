      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when run (typically during 'pip install'), executes the method LJDPoUFvZuOEmaksatzldQvhTRsheAcB. This method checks if the OS is Windows, then imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the 'cryptography' package), and executes code that is decrypted at runtime using Fernet. The encrypted payload is stored as a base64-encoded string and is only decrypted and executed on Windows systems. This is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious payloads during package installation, making detection and analysis more difficult. The use of obfuscated class and method names, as well as runtime decryption and execution of code, are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
