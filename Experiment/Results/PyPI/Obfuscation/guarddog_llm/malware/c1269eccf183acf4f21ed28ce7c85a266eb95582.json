      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and is likely designed to evade detection and perform potentially harmful actions, such as downloading and executing additional payloads from a remote server (the encoded command references a URL: 'http://dl.dropbox.com/...'). This is a common technique used in malware to download and run further malicious code on the victim's machine. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup script) to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
