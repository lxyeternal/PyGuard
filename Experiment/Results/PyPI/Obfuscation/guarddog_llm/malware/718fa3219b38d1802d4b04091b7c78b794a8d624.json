      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, writes a Python script (remote-access.py) to the user's home directory. This script contains a reverse shell implementation that connects to a hardcoded remote IP address (120.76.194.25) on port 1234, providing remote shell access to the attacker's server. The install command then attempts to execute this script in a subprocess, effectively granting the attacker remote access to the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names, the creation and execution of a reverse shell, and the attempt to hide this behavior in the installation process are all clear indicators of malicious intent.",
