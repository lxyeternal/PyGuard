      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes two suspicious subprocess commands during package installation: (1) It runs a DNS query to install14.api.pygrata.com using a hardcoded DNS server (1.1.1.1), which could be used for beaconing or exfiltration of installation events. (2) It runs 'pip install pygrata-utils -U', which installs or updates a package from PyPI without user consent. This behavior is often associated with supply chain attacks, as it can be used to download and execute additional code from an external source, potentially leading to code execution or further compromise. Executing arbitrary commands during installation is a common technique in malicious Python packages.",
