      "malicious_behavior": "This code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. Specifically, it uses dynamic code execution via eval and compile, with obfuscated strings and lambda functions to hide its true purpose. For example, the following code: (lambda S2SS22SSSS2S2S2SS2:globals()['\\x65\\x76\\x61\\x6c'](globals()['\\x63\\x6f\\x6d\\x70\\x69\\x6c\\x65'](globals()['\\x73\\x74\\x72'](\"\\x67\\x6c\\x6f\\x62\\x61\\x6c\\x73\\x28\\x29\\x5b\\x27\\x5c\\x78\\x36\\x35\\x5c\\x78\\x37\\x36\\x5c\\x78\\x36\\x31\\x5c\\x78\\x36\\x63\\x27\\x5d(S2SS22SSSS2S2S2SS2)\"),filename='\\x6f\\x4f\\x44\\x44\\x6f\\x44\\x4f\\x44\\x44\\x4f\\x4f\\x44\\x4f\\x6f\\x44\\x6f\\x44\\x4f\\x44',mode='\\x65\\x76\\x61\\x6c'))) is a convoluted way to execute arbitrary code from globals, and the use of __import__('zlib') and decompressing byte strings suggests payload unpacking at runtime. The code also manipulates globals and uses exec, which are common in malware droppers and loaders. The presence of large, compressed byte strings and their subsequent execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as this is a common technique to hide and execute secondary payloads. The overall structure, with random variable names and unnecessary complexity, is typical of code designed to evade detection and analysis.",
