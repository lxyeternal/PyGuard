      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes a remote Python script from 'https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode' by writing it to a randomly named .pyw file and running it with subprocess. It also communicates with a remote server (via requests.post to a URL fetched from Pastebin) and sends information such as the script's directory path. This behavior is characteristic of malware: it allows remote code execution, exfiltrates information, and uses obfuscated or non-standard variable names to evade detection. The use of external URLs to fetch code and commands, and the execution of that code, is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
