      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines a custom install command for a Python package that, when the package is installed, initiates a reverse shell connection to the hardcoded IP address 49.233.121.53 on port 54. The code uses base64 encoding to obfuscate the IP and port, creates a socket connection, redirects standard input/output/error to the socket, and then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the Python process. The use of a custom install command in setup.py to trigger this behavior during package installation is a common technique in supply chain attacks.",
