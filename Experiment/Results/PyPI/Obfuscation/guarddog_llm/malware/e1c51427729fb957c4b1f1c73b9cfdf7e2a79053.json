      "malicious_behavior": "This code downloads an executable file (DigitalPulse.exe) from an external URL (https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe) and executes it automatically on Windows systems during the installation process of the Python package. This is achieved by overriding the install command in setuptools with a custom PostInstallCommand class, which calls the app() function. The app() function uses requests to fetch the executable and os.system to run it. This behavior is highly suspicious and characteristic of malware delivery, as it can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine without their knowledge or consent.",
