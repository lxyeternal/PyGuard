The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity and avoid detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to run code without user visibility. The rest of the code is a decoy (a call to setup()), which is often used to disguise the true purpose of the script.",
