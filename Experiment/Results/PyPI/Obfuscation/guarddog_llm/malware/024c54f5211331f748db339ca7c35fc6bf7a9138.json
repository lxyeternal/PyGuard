      "malicious_behavior": "This code is designed to steal Discord authentication tokens from the victim's computer and exfiltrate them to an external location. Specifically: (1) It searches through various browser and Discord client directories for LevelDB files, which are known to store Discord tokens. (2) It uses regular expressions to extract tokens from these files. (3) It validates the tokens by making requests to the Discord API. (4) It retrieves a webhook or exfiltration URL from https://rentry.co/23azs/raw, and then sends the stolen tokens to that URL. This is a classic pattern for Discord token stealers, and the use of obfuscated variable names and threading further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
