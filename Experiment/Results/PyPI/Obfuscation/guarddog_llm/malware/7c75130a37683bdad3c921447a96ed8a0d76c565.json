      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, which is a typical method to obfuscate malicious activity. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW ensures the process is hidden from the user. This behavior is characteristic of malware droppers or downloaders, which often use encoded PowerShell to download and execute further payloads from the internet. The rest of the code is a decoy (setup script) to appear legitimate.",
