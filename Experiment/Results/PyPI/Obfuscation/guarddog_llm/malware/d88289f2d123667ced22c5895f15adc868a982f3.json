It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://5r13v9.ceye.io), which is a known data exfiltration technique. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further suggests an attempt to evade detection. This behavior is clearly malicious as it exfiltrates potentially sensitive user and environment information without consent.",
