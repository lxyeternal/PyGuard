It searches the local file system for Discord authentication tokens by scanning the LevelDB storage of Discord and several browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex). It uses regular expressions to extract Discord tokens from these files. The extracted tokens are then exfiltrated to two hardcoded Discord webhook URLs via HTTP POST requests. This is a classic example of a Discord token stealer, which can allow an attacker to hijack user accounts and perform further malicious actions.",
