      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a batch file (bbb.bat) from a remote server (https://frvezdff.pythonanywhere.com/getrnr) and saves it to the user's APPDATA directory. It then copies this batch file to the Windows Startup folder, ensuring it will execute on every system boot (persistence mechanism). The code executes the batch file in a hidden window (subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW), and finally forces an immediate system reboot (os.system('shutdown /r /f')). This sequence of actions is characteristic of malware: remote code retrieval, persistence installation, silent execution, and forced reboot. The obfuscated variable names and unnecessary complexity further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
