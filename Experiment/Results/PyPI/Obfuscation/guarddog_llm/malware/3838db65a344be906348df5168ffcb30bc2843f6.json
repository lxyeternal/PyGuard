      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered (such as during pip install), executes a reverse shell payload. Specifically, it constructs a Python one-liner that opens a reverse shell to the hardcoded IP address 121.4.154.240 on port 4501, encodes this command in base64, and then executes it via os.system('echo ...|base64 -d|bash'). This allows remote attackers to gain shell access to the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, as well as the abuse of the setup.py install process, are strong indicators of malicious intent.",
