It defines a custom install command (lJKzoCVVFsTniQxLAhBofeghykpmUMWE) for setuptools that, during installation on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute a large encrypted payload via exec(). The use of exec() on decrypted data is a common obfuscation technique to hide malicious code, such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other harmful actions. The payload is only executed on Windows systems, further indicating targeted malicious intent. The obfuscation of variable and class names, as well as the use of encrypted code, are strong indicators of an attempt to evade detection.",
