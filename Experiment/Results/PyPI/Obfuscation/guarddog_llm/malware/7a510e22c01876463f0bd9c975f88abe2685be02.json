The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' are typical indicators of attempts to hide execution and obfuscate the payload. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file from a remote server (esquelesql.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads.",
