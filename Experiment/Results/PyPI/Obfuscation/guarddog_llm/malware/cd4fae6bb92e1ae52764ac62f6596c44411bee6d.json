      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines custom setuptools install and egg_info commands that, when triggered (such as during pip install or python setup.py install), execute the function jAxZxNMDdKcMmmxsMSQwTaCaIKTLduTx. This function collects process information and writes it to a file, but more importantly, it attempts to establish a reverse shell by connecting to the remote IP address 3.228.3.164 on port 80. It then redirects standard input/output/error to this socket and spawns a bash shell using pty.spawn('/bin/bash'), effectively granting remote shell access to the attacker. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern in Python packages.",
