      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command in a hidden window using an encoded command string. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The encoded PowerShell command (when decoded) downloads and executes a file from a remote server (http://dl.dropbox.com/s/szgnyt9zbub0qmv/Esquele.exe?dl=0) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads. The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window and encoded PowerShell is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
