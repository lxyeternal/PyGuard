      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen. The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is encoded, but decoding it reveals that it downloads and executes a file from a remote server (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...) and saves it as 'Esquelele.exe', then runs it and attempts to delete the executable. This is a classic pattern for malware delivery and execution, often used to drop and run additional malicious payloads on the victim's machine. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW further indicates an attempt to hide the execution from the user.",
