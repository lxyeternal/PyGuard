      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a common technique to hide malicious activity from the user. The encoded command downloads and executes a file from a remote server (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a type of malware that fetches and executes additional malicious payloads. The use of exception handling to suppress errors and the attempt to blend in with legitimate setup.py packaging code further indicate an attempt to evade detection.",
