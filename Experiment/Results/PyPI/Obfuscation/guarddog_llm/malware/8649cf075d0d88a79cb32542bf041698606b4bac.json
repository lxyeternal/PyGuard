      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It searches the victim's filesystem for sensitive files, specifically '.env' files (which often contain credentials and secrets) and the user's private SSH key ('~/.ssh/id_rsa'). It then base64-encodes the contents of these files and the environment variables, and exfiltrates them to a remote server (http://bellazik.000webhostapp.com:443) using HTTP requests via curl. The malicious functions are triggered during the installation of the package by overriding the setuptools install and develop commands, ensuring the payload runs automatically when the package is installed via pip. This is a classic example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package.",
