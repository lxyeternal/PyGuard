      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command in a hidden window using a base64-encoded payload. This is done only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of 'subprocess.Popen' to run a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as this technique is often used to download and execute additional malware or perform other unauthorized actions on the system. The obfuscation of the command and the attempt to hide the window further reinforce the malicious nature of the code.",
