(2) It downloads a suspicious executable (ini_file_pyp_32.exe) from an external site (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and executes it using os.system('start ...'), which is a strong indicator of attempted remote code execution and possible further compromise. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, meaning it will execute automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are highly suspicious and align with known malware distribution tactics.",
