This is a common technique used by malware to download and execute additional payloads or perform other malicious actions without user consent. The use of subprocess.Popen with 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand ...' is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to evade detection and run arbitrary code.",
