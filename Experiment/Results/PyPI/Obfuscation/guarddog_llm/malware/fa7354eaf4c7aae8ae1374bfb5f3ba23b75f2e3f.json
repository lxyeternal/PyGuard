In these classes, the overridden methods make HTTP GET requests to the external domain 'http://poiqwe.info' during both pre- and post-installation events. This behavior is highly suspicious and indicative of a malicious 'phone home' or beaconing action, which can be used for tracking installations, exfiltrating data, or as a precursor to further malicious activity. The use of obfuscated class and method names further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
