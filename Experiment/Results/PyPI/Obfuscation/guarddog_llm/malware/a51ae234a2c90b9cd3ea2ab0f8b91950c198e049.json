      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a PowerShell command in a hidden window using an encoded command string. The command downloads and executes a file from a remote URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is classic downloader/dropper behavior, commonly used in malware to fetch and execute additional payloads. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand are typical evasion techniques to avoid detection. The code is triggered only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common persistence or anti-analysis trick.",
