      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is encoded and is likely designed to download and execute a remote script from 'https://github.com/T4hg/eee/raw/master/Stage1.exe' and save it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then execute it. This is a classic pattern for a downloader or dropper, which is a common malware technique. The use of -WindowStyle Hidden and -EncodedCommand is intended to evade detection and hide execution from the user. The rest of the code is a decoy setup() call to appear as a legitimate Python package.",
