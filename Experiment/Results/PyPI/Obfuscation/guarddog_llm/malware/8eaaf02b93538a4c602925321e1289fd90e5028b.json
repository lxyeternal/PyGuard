      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several indicators of malicious behavior: (1) It executes arbitrary code via exec(m.loads(...)), where the payload is a marshaled code object, making its intent opaque and likely designed to evade static analysis. (2) It creates a suspicious directory ('DiscordSword'), which is a common tactic for malware to store files or exfiltrate data. (3) It changes the working directory to a specific user path ('C:/Users/User/Desktop'), which is unusual for legitimate setup scripts. (4) The use of try/except to silently suppress errors is a common obfuscation technique in malware. (5) The code only triggers on 'install', which is a common way to hide malicious payloads in Python packages. All these factors strongly indicate the code is malicious.",
