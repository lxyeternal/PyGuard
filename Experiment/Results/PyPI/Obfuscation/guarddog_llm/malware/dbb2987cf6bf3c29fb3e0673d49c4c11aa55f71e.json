      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of a Discord token stealer. It searches for Discord and browser tokens on the victim's machine by scanning various LevelDB storage locations in the user's AppData directories. It uses regular expressions to extract Discord tokens from these files. The code then validates the tokens by making requests to the Discord API, collects user information (such as email, phone, and billing info), and exfiltrates this data to a remote webhook (the URL is base64-encoded and likely points to a Discord webhook controlled by the attacker). The use of obfuscated variable and function names, as well as the import of suspiciously named modules (receiver and sender), further indicate attempts to evade detection. The code is designed to run automatically and send sensitive user data to an external party without user consent.",

While this could be used as part of a malicious payload (e.g., exfiltrating network information), by itself, simply obtaining the public IP address is not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, command and control, or other harmful actions in this code. The detection is likely a false positive due to the use of an external service to obtain the IP address.",
