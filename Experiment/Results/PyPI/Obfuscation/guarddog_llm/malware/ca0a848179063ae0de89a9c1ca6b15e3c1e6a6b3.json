The function XZWmkWQqccpVwsAZXayCndGAMyDuWsEK creates a socket, connects to the remote host, and then redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to this socket. It then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i), effectively giving the remote host control over the compromised system. The presence of os.system('touch /tmp/test1563.txt') is used as a marker to prevent repeated execution, which is a common technique in malware to avoid multiple infections. This code is a textbook example of a Python reverse shell.",
