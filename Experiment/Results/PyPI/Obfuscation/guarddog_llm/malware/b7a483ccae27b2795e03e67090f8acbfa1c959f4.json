      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines a custom install command for setuptools/distutils (SLnDxMDyhIkrtKoRXWVlfiMmzLRWaQPh) that executes a base64-encoded payload during package installation. The decoded payload performs the following actions: (1) It checks the operating system and, if on Windows, attempts to rename and execute a file named 'new.vbs', which is likely a dropped or downloaded script. (2) It makes HTTP requests to remote servers (including 'grabify.link', a known IP logger/stealer service) and downloads further payloads, which are then written to disk and executed. (3) The code attempts to obfuscate its behavior with random variable names and by hiding the main logic in a base64-encoded string executed via exec(). This is a classic pattern for Python malware distributed via PyPI or similar package repositories, aiming to infect systems during package installation.",
