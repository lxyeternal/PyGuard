      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple clear signs of malicious behavior: (1) It collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable and sends it to a remote server (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a form of data exfiltration. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (ini_file_pyp_41.exe) from a suspicious domain (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and executes it using os.system('start ...'), which is a classic method for delivering and running malware. (3) The malicious logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, meaning it will execute automatically when the package is installed, which is a common technique for supply chain attacks. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, further indicating an attempt to evade detection.",
