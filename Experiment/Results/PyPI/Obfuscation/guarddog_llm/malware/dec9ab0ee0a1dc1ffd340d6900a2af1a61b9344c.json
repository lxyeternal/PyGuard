It defines a custom install command (HWLtlyflYAXcrWTkZbyJllFAbteCixiO) that, during installation on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' libraries, then uses Fernet symmetric encryption to decrypt and execute a block of encrypted code via exec(). The decrypted payload is not visible in the source, making it impossible to determine its intent without decryption, but this pattern is a classic method for hiding and executing malicious code (such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or other attacks) during package installation. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, as well as the execution of hidden code, is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
