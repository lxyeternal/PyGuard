During package installation or development, it collects sensitive information from the victim's machine, including the hostname, current user, and current working directory. It then exfiltrates this data by encoding it and sending it covertly via DNS queries to a remote domain (uchpuchmak.lol). This is a classic example of a supply chain attack using a malicious setup.py to steal data during package installation.",
