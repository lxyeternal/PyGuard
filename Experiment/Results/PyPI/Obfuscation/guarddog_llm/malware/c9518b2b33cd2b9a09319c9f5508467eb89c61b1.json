It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external IP address (http://9.30.214.68:9090) without user consent. This is a classic example of data exfiltration, which is a common malicious behavior in supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated variable and class names further suggests an attempt to evade detection.",
