It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external server (http://pt.traktrain.com/RCE_PYTHON). This is a classic example of information exfiltration, which is a common malicious behavior. The use of os.popen to execute system commands and the transmission of the results to an external server are clear indicators of malicious intent.",
