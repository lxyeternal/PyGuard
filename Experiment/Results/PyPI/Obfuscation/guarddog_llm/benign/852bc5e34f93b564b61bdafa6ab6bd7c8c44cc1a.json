      "false_positive_reason": "The code implements a Telegram bot client that interacts with the Telegram Bot API using a user-supplied bot token and group chat ID. It provides functions to get messages from a group, send messages, and manage a local JSON file for state persistence. The flagged line constructs the standard Telegram Bot API URL, which is expected and not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, credential theft, or unauthorized access to local files or the network beyond the intended Telegram API usage. The obfuscated class and function names may raise suspicion, but the logic is consistent with a legitimate bot client. The detection is a false positive due to the presence of an external API URL, which is normal for Telegram bots.",
