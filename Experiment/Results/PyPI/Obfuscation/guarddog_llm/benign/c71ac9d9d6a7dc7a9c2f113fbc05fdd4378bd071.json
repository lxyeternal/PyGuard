      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line uses subprocess.check_call to invoke 'make' with a build target, which is a standard practice in Python setuptools extensions that require building native code (e.g., C libraries). The code does not execute arbitrary user input or download/execute remote code. The obfuscated variable and class names are unusual but do not, by themselves, indicate malicious intent. The subprocess call is limited to building a static library ('build/libminiupnpc.a'), which is referenced in the Extension build process. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
