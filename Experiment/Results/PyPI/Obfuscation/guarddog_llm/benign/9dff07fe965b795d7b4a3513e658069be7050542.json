This is a common utility function and, by itself, does not constitute malicious behavior. There is no evidence in the code that sensitive data is being exfiltrated, nor is there any code that automatically or covertly copies user data without user interaction. The function is named 'copy' and is consistent with typical clipboard utility functions. The rest of the code is a large utility library with no signs of malicious intent.",
