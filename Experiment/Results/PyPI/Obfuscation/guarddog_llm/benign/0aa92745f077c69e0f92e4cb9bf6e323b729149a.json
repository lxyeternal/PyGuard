This is a common and expected feature in CLI tools that manage configuration or credentials, especially when sharing sanitized configs between users. There is no evidence of exfiltration, unauthorized access, or surreptitious clipboard manipulation. The clipboard access is user-initiated and transparent, and the data being copied is not sent elsewhere. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
