      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple hardcoded HTTP endpoints pointing to an IP address (http://157.136.253.53:24000) for user signup, signin, and posting reactions. The functions oQyoXWEQLXxtRcNqZXBHEUMWgQkJVQPZ and IAorlAIexuKJmywBfaWhZcQyKqVjXVhP interact with these endpoints, sending user credentials (including passwords) and receiving access tokens. The use of non-standard, obfuscated variable names and the lack of any clear documentation or legitimate context for these endpoints is highly suspicious. The code appears to collect credentials and send them to an external, non-canonical server, which is a common pattern in credential harvesting and exfiltration attacks. Additionally, the endpoints are not using HTTPS, which further increases the risk of credential interception. The code does not appear to serve a legitimate business purpose for these network interactions, and the endpoints are not associated with any well-known or trusted service.",
