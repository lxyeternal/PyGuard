      "false_positive_reason": "The code flagged as potentially malicious is: eval(JypjUVnWgzAzFBhKYKvvUCQIdXonnasu.group(1)). While the use of eval can be dangerous if it evaluates untrusted input, in this context it is only used to parse the __version__ tuple from the __init__.py file of the same package. This is a common pattern in Python packaging to extract the version tuple. The input to eval is controlled by the package author and not by an external user, so there is no realistic attack vector here. The rest of the code is standard setup script logic. The security tool likely flagged this due to the presence of eval, but in this context, it is not malicious.",
