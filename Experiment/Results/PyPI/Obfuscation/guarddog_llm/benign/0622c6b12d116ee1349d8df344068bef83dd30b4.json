The use of subprocess here is not inherently malicious, as it does not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, nor does it download or run external scripts. The rest of the code is a standard setuptools.setup() call with obfuscated variable names, but no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The security tool likely flagged this due to the use of subprocess, but in this context, it is a benign and common usage.",
