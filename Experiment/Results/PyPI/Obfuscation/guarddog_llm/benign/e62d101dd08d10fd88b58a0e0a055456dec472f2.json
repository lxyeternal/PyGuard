The rest of the code is similarly obfuscated but does not perform any malicious actions such as code execution, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation is likely for code obfuscation or anti-reverse engineering purposes, not for malicious intent. The detection is a false positive triggered by the use of non-descriptive, obfuscated variable names rather than actual malicious behavior.",
