While executing shell commands during installation can be a red flag, in this case, the command only lists the root directory and prints it, without exfiltrating data or performing harmful actions. There is no evidence of data being sent to a remote server, file modification, or privilege escalation. This behavior is unusual and potentially suspicious, but not inherently malicious in this context.",
