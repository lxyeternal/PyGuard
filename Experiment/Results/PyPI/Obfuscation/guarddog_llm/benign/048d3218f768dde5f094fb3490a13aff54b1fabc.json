      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines use subprocess to run 'make clean' and 'make library -j 4' in a subdirectory, which is a common pattern for building native code dependencies (such as C/C++ libraries) as part of a Python package installation process. The directory and filenames (e.g., 'frotz', 'libfrotz.so') suggest this is building the Frotz library, which is a well-known open-source Z-machine interpreter. There is no evidence of arbitrary or user-supplied code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The use of exec(open('jericho/version.py').read()) is not best practice but is commonly used to inject version information and does not by itself indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard build/install script for a Python package with native components.",
