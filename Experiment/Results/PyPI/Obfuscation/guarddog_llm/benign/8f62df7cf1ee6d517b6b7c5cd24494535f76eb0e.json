The code constructs a request using an API key from environment variables and parses the XML response to check if today is a holiday or weekend. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, as no sensitive or user data is being sent to an external server; only a public API is being queried. The variable and function names are obfuscated, which may have triggered the tool, but the logic is benign and typical for a holiday-checking utility.",
