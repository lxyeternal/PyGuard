      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line uses subprocess.check_output to call ['mecab-config', '--libs-only-L'], which is a standard way to check for MeCab library paths in Python packaging scripts. This is a common pattern in setup scripts to determine system dependencies and does not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code. The rest of the script is a typical setuptools.setup() call for packaging a Python library. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The detection is likely a false positive due to the generic use of subprocess, which is often flagged by automated tools.",
