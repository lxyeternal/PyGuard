The flagged line is simply setting the default API base URL for this service. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, unauthorized access, or other malicious actions. The code uses standard libraries and practices for API interaction, and all sensitive information (API keys) is handled via environment variables. The detection is a false positive due to the presence of an external API URL, which is expected in this context.",
