The flagged line is simply setting the default API base URL for the Together API, which is a legitimate public service for AI models. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code execution, or other malicious activity. The code only interacts with the Together API for its intended purpose (embedding generation). The detection is a false positive due to the presence of a non-standard API endpoint, but this is expected for third-party AI services.",
