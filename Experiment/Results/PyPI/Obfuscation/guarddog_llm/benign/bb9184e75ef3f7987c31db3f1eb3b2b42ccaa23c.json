      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line uses subprocess.check_call to execute shell commands, but the commands are hardcoded to run standard development tools (pytest, pep8, pylint) on the project's own files. This is a common pattern in Python packaging and build scripts, especially in custom setuptools commands. There is no evidence of arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activity. The use of obfuscated variable and class names is unusual but not inherently malicious. The detection is a false positive due to the generic nature of subprocess usage in build/test automation.",
