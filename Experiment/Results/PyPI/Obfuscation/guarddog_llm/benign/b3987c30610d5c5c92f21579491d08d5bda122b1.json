This is a common pattern in setup.py files for packages that have optional native dependencies. The code does not execute arbitrary or user-supplied commands, nor does it download, exfiltrate, or modify data in a suspicious way. The use of subprocess here is limited to querying system configuration for dependency management, not for malicious purposes.",
