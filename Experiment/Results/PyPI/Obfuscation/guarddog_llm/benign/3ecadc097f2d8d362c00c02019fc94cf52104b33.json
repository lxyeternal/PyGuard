      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads a line from a source file (src/graceful/__init__.py) that starts with 'VERSION', splits it on '=', and then passes the right-hand side to eval(). This means that any code present after 'VERSION=' in that file will be executed with full Python privileges. This is a classic code execution vulnerability and can be exploited if an attacker can modify the __init__.py file or if the file is compromised. Using eval() on file contents is highly dangerous and is a common vector for malicious code execution.",
