      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded suspicious URL 'https://aupd.19700101t000000z.com' which is not a known or trusted domain. The function BTdhubORhNSbhtKXXzhwLCILkSztxyEQ runs a progress bar to simulate an update preparation, then immediately executes a subprocess call to pip install using the suspicious URL as the package name. This means it attempts to install a package directly from a remote URL that is likely attacker-controlled. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks or malware that downloads and executes untrusted code without user consent. The obfuscated variable names and lack of any user interaction or validation further indicate malicious intent. The code effectively automates the retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote source, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
