      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that executes a shell command via os.system to open a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded external IP address (81.46.246.181) on port 4444 using bash. This reverse shell allows an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine. The function is called immediately during the package setup process, meaning the malicious payload executes automatically upon installation without user consent or interaction. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, enabling unauthorized remote control. The use of obfuscated function names, execution during setup, and hardcoded attacker-controlled IP address strongly indicate malicious intent."
