      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a string variable containing Python code that implements a reverse shell connecting to a hardcoded IP address (82.157.252.61) on port 1234. This reverse shell code attempts to spawn a command shell (cmd on Windows, bash on Linux) and redirect input/output over a socket, enabling remote command execution. The malicious payload is written to a file named 'remote-access.py' in the user's home or Documents directory during the installation process of the package. The custom install command class (subclassing setuptools.command.install.install) overrides the install process to write this reverse shell script to disk and then launch it in a subprocess without user consent or notification. The package setup uses obfuscated variable names and triggers this behavior automatically on installation, which is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The presence of subprocess.Popen to spawn the reverse shell script, hardcoded attacker-controlled IP, network socket communication, and execution of arbitrary shell commands remotely are definitive signs of a remote access trojan (RAT). This code is designed to stealthily gain unauthorized remote control over the victim machine immediately upon package installation, without any legitimate purpose or user interaction. Therefore, this code is malicious."
