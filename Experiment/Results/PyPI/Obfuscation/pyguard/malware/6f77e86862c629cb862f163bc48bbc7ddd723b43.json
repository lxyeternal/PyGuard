      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques, including extensive use of eval on dynamically decoded strings, base64 decoding, and zlib decompression, which are classic methods to hide malicious payloads. The code dynamically imports modules such as base64, zlib, bytes, and exec, then decodes and decompresses a large base64-encoded payload, which is subsequently executed via eval or exec. This pattern is a hallmark of malware that conceals its true intent and payload to evade detection. The obfuscated variable and function names, combined with the execution of decoded and decompressed data, strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden or dynamically generated malicious payloads. Such behavior is typical of information stealers, remote code execution backdoors, or supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate user interaction or benign context, and the code appears to execute automatically, further confirming its malicious nature."
