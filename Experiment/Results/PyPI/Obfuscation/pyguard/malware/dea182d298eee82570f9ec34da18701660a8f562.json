      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function that collects all environment variables from the host system and encodes them as URL parameters. It then attempts to send this encoded environment data via an HTTP request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://6f69-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app), which is an attacker-controlled domain often used for tunneling and exfiltration. This data collection and exfiltration occurs automatically during package installation phases by hooking into setuptools commands (install, develop, egg_info), ensuring execution without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated function and variable names, combined with the automatic environment data leak to an external server during installation, are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware. Additionally, the code attempts to perform the network request using a non-existent attribute (urllib.KRblMRJRlAGMDNBafvuhGEEhtAwpcyPW.Request), which suggests either obfuscation or a coding error, but the intent to send environment data externally is clear. Overall, this behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including environment variable harvesting, exfiltration to a suspicious external endpoint, and execution during package installation."
