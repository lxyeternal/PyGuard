      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains obfuscated function and variable names, which is a common evasion technique. During execution, it sends an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL notifying that the package 'reverse_shell' has been installed, indicating unauthorized data exfiltration or alerting an attacker-controlled server. It clones a GitHub repository from a suspicious URL ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') into a fixed system path ('C:\\Users\\repo') without user consent or interaction, then changes the working directory to this location and executes a script ('bypass.py') via subprocess. This sequence of downloading and executing remote code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The setup() call is present but does not prevent the malicious side effects from occurring. The code runs the malicious function automatically when executed as __main__, which can happen during installation or direct execution. Overall, the combination of network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints, cloning and executing untrusted code, obfuscated naming, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."

Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
