      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute arbitrary decrypted code during package installation. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This occurs silently during the install phase without user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and dynamic code execution in the install hook is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The code targets Windows systems (os.name == 'nt') and attempts to run potentially malicious code fetched from the encrypted payload. This behavior is strongly indicative of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution during package installation, a known vector for malware distribution and system compromise."
