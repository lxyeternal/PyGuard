      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during installation, downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://tryg.ga/normal.exe') and immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated class and method names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Downloading and executing an external binary during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate purpose for this action, making it a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
