      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user information such as Discord tokens, emails, phone numbers, billing information, and user environment data without user consent. The code accesses environment variables to locate browser and application data directories, extracts cookies, passwords, and tokens from various browsers and Discord clients, decrypts encrypted data using Windows APIs, and collects files from user directories. It then exfiltrates this stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and uploads files to external file hosting services. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, base64 decoding, AES decryption, and threading to evade detection and perform background data collection and exfiltration. It also kills processes related to browsers or wallets to access locked files, compresses stolen data into zip archives, and sends detailed user and system information to attacker-controlled endpoints. The absence of any legitimate user interaction, the use of hardcoded attacker-controlled URLs, and the comprehensive data theft and exfiltration functionality confirm that this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module with a suspicious and obfuscated name 'module.pytoolib' and calls a function with a similarly obfuscated name 'IUOCZmJRhWyhkGhhqjbRabLbYKuKHuWK' passing the string 'boolean' as an argument. The use of obfuscated module and function names is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to evade detection and analysis. Without further context, such obfuscation typically suggests the code is designed to hide its true purpose, which is a hallmark of malware. Given the absence of any benign context, the code likely executes hidden or unauthorized actions, potentially including arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise."
