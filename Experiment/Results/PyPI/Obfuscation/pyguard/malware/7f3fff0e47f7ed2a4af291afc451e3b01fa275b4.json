      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The encoded command is not human-readable and is executed directly without validation or user consent, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, which can be used to evade detection or analysis. The rest of the code appears to be a benign setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate that the code is malicious, designed to execute hidden PowerShell commands potentially for payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation."
