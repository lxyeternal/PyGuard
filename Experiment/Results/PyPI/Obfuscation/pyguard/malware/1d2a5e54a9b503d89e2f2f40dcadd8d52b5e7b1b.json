      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The subprocess is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands, hidden execution, and subprocess spawning without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a try-except block that suppresses any errors silently, which is a common evasion technique. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspicious package name and version, which may be an attempt to disguise the malicious payload within a package installation script, a known supply chain attack vector. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
