      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware evasion technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or detected runs. The use of subprocess.Popen to run an encoded PowerShell command in hidden mode without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to execute payloads, download further malware, or perform unauthorized actions stealthily. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context (distutils.core.setup) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation, a known malware distribution method. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection or analysis. Overall, these behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution during package installation."
