      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it constructs a shell command that creates a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded remote host ('e6j4342057.zicp.fun') on port 26264. The shell command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via 'os.system' with 'bash'. This behavior enables remote code execution and a reverse shell connection, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized remote access to the victim's system. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding of the command, execution during package installation without user interaction, and connection to a suspicious hardcoded domain are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation to establish a backdoor. Therefore, the code contains critical malicious behavior."
