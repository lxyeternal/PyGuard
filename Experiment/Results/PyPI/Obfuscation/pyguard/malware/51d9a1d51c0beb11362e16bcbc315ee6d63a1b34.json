      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. Inside the overridden method, it checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded string and is decrypted and executed at install time without user interaction or consent. This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during installation strongly indicate malicious intent. The code attempts to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
