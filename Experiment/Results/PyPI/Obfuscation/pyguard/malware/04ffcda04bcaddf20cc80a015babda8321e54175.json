      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window style), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with encoded commands, combined with the suppression of exceptions and lack of user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name and no legitimate context suggests an attempt to disguise or deliver malicious code during package installation. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and potential supply chain attack vectors."
