      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs and executes a shell command using subprocess with shell=True, which sends a POST request via curl to a hardcoded external URL (https://eozjyg0uj1pesea.m.pipedream.net). The request headers include sensitive system information such as the hostname, current user (whoami), current working directory (pwd), and a directory listing (ls -la) as the POST data. This behavior constitutes automated, non-consensual collection and exfiltration of system environment data to an attacker-controlled endpoint without any user interaction or legitimate purpose. The use of obfuscated function and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Such direct environment discovery and data exfiltration patterns are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with information-stealing malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides an install method with an obfuscated name. During installation, it calls a function RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb imported from a module named pre_install. The function and class names are obfuscated and meaningless, which is a common evasion technique. The setup metadata uses a suspicious, nonsensical package name and a non-resolving download URL (http://notapplicable.notapplicable), which is unusual and suspicious. The custom install command executes code during package installation, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. Because the actual behavior of RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb is unknown but is invoked automatically during install, this strongly suggests malicious intent, as legitimate packages rarely execute arbitrary code on install without user interaction or clear purpose. The obfuscation, automatic execution during install, and suspicious metadata collectively indicate this code is malicious."
