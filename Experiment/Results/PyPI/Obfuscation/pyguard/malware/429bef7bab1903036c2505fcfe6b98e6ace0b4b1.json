      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in supply chain attacks. The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated code during package installation without user consent or interaction, which can lead to remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. The obfuscated variable names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during install strongly indicate malicious intent."
