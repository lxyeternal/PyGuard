      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it hooks into the setuptools install command to execute code automatically during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it registers an atexit function that writes a suspicious file 'pocbykotko.txt' with a message, then silently collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()), and the absolute path of the current script directory. It encodes this collected data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with obfuscated query parameters. This behavior constitutes automated environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding, and network communication to an attacker-controlled server without user interaction or notification further confirms malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent involved, and the code executes automatically on install, making it a high-risk malicious payload embedded in the setup script."
