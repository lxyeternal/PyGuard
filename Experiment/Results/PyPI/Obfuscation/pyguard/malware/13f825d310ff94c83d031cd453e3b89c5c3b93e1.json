      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a classic technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be an evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspicious package name and version, but this part appears benign or a cover. The critical indicator is the subprocess.Popen call with an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently, which strongly indicates malicious intent such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
