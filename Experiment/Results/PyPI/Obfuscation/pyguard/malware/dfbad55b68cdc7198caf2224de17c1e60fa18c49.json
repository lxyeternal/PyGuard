      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the package name, the current logged-in username, the hostname, detailed platform information, the current working directory, and the local IP address. It then encodes this collected data in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://162.62.15.24/v/...). This exfiltration of system and user information without user consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior. Furthermore, this data collection and exfiltration occurs automatically during the package setup process (via setuptools.setup), which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The obfuscated variable names and the use of base64 encoding to hide the data being sent further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the external server is not a known trusted endpoint. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information, constituting malicious behavior."
