      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information such as the username (from USER environment variable), hostname (from HOSTNAME environment variable and socket.gethostname()), and current working directory. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/), which is a known endpoint often used for capturing exfiltrated data. Subsequently, the code establishes a TCP socket connection to a remote host (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io on port 19931) and redirects the standard input/output/error file descriptors to this socket, effectively creating a reverse shell. It then spawns a shell ('sh') via pty.spawn, allowing remote command execution on the victim machine. The obfuscated class and variable names, absence of user interaction or consent, and the combination of environment data exfiltration followed by reverse shell creation are hallmark indicators of malicious behavior, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
