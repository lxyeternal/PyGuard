      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag and WindowStyle Hidden, indicating an attempt to run stealthily without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it enables stealthy execution of potentially harmful or unauthorized commands on the system. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands, hidden execution, and lack of user interaction or consent are critical indicators of malicious intent."
