      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the Python package installation process (setup script) and performs actions automatically during install or build commands without user interaction or consent. It targets Windows platforms and attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package if missing, which is a legitimate package but often abused for Windows COM automation. The script creates a hidden Chrome extension in the user's APPDATA directory with obfuscated JavaScript code that repeatedly runs a function every second. This JavaScript manipulates the clipboard content by replacing cryptocurrency addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a classic clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency transactions. The script then enumerates common user shortcut locations (Start Menu, Taskbar, Desktop) and modifies shortcuts to Chrome, Edge, Brave, or launcher executables to load the malicious extension silently on browser startup, ensuring persistence and stealth. The use of obfuscated JavaScript, automatic file creation in system/user directories, and modification of shortcuts to inject malicious browser extensions are hallmark behaviors of malware, specifically clipboard hijackers targeting cryptocurrency users. The code runs without user notification or consent and leverages setup/install hooks to execute automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including environment variable access, file writing to sensitive locations, obfuscated payloads, persistence mechanisms, and clipboard manipulation for credential theft."
