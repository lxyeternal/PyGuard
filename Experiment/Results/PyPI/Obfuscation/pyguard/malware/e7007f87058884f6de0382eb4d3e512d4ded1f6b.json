      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and the execution of decrypted code during installation are hallmark signs of a supply chain attack or malware. Additionally, the package name is suspicious and randomly generated, and the setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used in the malicious payload execution. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code is designed to run stealthily during installation, which is a common vector for malware delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
