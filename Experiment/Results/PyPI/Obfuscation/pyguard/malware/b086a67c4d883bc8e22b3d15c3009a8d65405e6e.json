      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('syswin32.exe') from a suspicious, non-standard URL ('https://tryg.ga/syswin32.exe') without any user interaction or consent. Immediately after downloading, it executes this file using a shell command ('start syswin32.exe'). This pattern of automated file download and execution during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The use of an obscure domain, lack of validation or user notification, and execution of an untrusted binary strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the setup call contains obfuscated or meaningless parameter names, which is often used to evade detection. Overall, this code exhibits critical risk indicators such as remote payload retrieval and execution during installation, which are strongly associated with malware."
