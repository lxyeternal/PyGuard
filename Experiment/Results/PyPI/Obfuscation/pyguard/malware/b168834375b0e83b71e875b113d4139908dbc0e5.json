      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports everything from a relative module named 'src_file' and then calls a function with a highly obfuscated and random-looking name 'AkaZRlGQjVIqeitKqceyYidozfYNwsXp()'. The use of a relative import with a non-descriptive module name and a function with a randomized, obfuscated name is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common evasion technique to hide the true purpose of the code. Additionally, the code does not show any user interaction or legitimate business logic, and the function call is executed immediately upon import, which is typical for malware that triggers payload execution without user consent. The presence of the 'colorama' import is likely a decoy or used for minimal output formatting to avoid suspicion. Without the actual source of 'src_file', the function call cannot be verified as benign, but given the obfuscation and immediate execution pattern, this code strongly aligns with known malicious behaviors such as code obfuscation, stealth execution, and potential payload delivery or execution. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user environment information such as the current username and paths to application data directories. It targets specific files related to the Exodus wallet (e.g., wallet configuration, seed, passphrase, two-factor secrets) and attempts to archive them into a ZIP file in the user's roaming appdata directory. The code then uses the Telegram Bot API with a hardcoded bot token and chat ID to exfiltrate the collected ZIP archive and a message containing user and IP information. The obfuscated variable names, lack of user interaction or consent, and automated network transmission of sensitive wallet files to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel are hallmark signs of malicious credential theft and data exfiltration. Additionally, the code attempts to clean up by deleting the ZIP archive after sending, further indicating stealthy behavior. These actions align with known patterns of wallet-stealing malware that silently harvests cryptocurrency wallet data and sends it to attackers without user knowledge."
