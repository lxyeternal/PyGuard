      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class that overrides the install process to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, the function sfvECQfFOzINIUxceqhyIrGARaZukMEs() reads the system uptime from /proc/uptime, collects detailed system information including OS release, system name, version, platform, and the host IP address. It then constructs a string combining this information and opens a raw socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 80, sending the collected system information without any user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic example of silent environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated function and variable names, the execution of network communication during install, and the exfiltration of sensitive system information to a hardcoded external server are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the code attempts to stealthily collect and transmit system data, which aligns with known malware patterns."
