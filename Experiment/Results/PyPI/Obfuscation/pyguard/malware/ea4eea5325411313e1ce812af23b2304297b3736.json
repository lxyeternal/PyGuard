      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and other credentials by accessing local application data directories and decrypting stored secrets using Windows APIs. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, base64 decoding, and encrypted payloads to hide its intent. It exfiltrates stolen data to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and external URLs, including hardcoded suspicious domains. The code also kills processes related to browsers or wallets to access locked files, compresses stolen data into zip archives, uploads them to file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. It performs environment reconnaissance (e.g., IP geolocation, username retrieval) without user consent and uses threading to run background data collection tasks stealthily. The presence of direct network communication to suspicious endpoints, automated extraction and exfiltration of credentials, and obfuscated code patterns are hallmark traits of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to steal sensitive information from the victim's machine."
