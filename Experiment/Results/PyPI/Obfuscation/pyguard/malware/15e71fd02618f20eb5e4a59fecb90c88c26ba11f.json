      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or redundant execution. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, which is a common stealth technique in malware. The encoded command likely contains further instructions that are not visible in the source code, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further hiding the malicious activity. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution based on file system state, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
