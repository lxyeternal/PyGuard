      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports base64 and immediately executes a base64-decoded string using exec. The decoded payload dynamically imports the 'urllib.request' module and performs a URL open operation to 'https://cyberresearch.pythonanywhere.com/reporter.py', reads its content, decodes it, and executes it. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code at runtime without user interaction or validation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the URL and the direct execution of downloaded code is a classic technique for remote code execution and payload delivery in malware. Additionally, the domain 'pythonanywhere.com' is a free hosting service often abused by attackers to host malicious scripts. The obfuscated import from '.core' with suspiciously random names further suggests evasion attempts. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including code obfuscation, remote code fetching, and dynamic execution without user consent."
