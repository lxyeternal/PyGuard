      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden shell process, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the code is a benign-looking setup call, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution in the same script strongly suggests the package is attempting to execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads during installation. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during package setup."
