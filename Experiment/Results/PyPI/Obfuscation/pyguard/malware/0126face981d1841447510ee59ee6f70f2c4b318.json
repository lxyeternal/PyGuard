      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides an installation hook method. Inside this method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large base64-encoded payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during install time without user interaction strongly indicate malicious intent. The code attempts to run this only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which suggests targeted behavior. The presence of 'requests' and 'fernet' in setup_requires further supports that the package is designed to perform network and cryptographic operations, likely to fetch or decrypt malicious payloads. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code during package installation, which is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware."
