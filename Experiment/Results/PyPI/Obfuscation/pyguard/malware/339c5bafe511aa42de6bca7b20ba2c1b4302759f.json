      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique in malware. This behavior is strongly indicative of malicious intent, as it involves obfuscated code execution without user interaction or notification, and the use of hidden PowerShell commands is a hallmark of malware for executing payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. The rest of the code is a benign setup call, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution in the installation script strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malicious payload delivery during package installation."
