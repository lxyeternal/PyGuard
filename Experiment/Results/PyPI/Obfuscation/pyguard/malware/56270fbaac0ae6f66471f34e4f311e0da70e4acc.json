      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect Discord authentication tokens from various local application data directories, including Discord clients and several browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex). It searches for token patterns in LevelDB files under Local Storage directories. The collected tokens are then formatted and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an attacker-controlled endpoint. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to evade detection. There is no user interaction or consent, and the data exfiltration happens silently. This behavior matches known patterns of credential-stealing malware that harvests sensitive tokens and exfiltrates them to remote servers without authorization."
