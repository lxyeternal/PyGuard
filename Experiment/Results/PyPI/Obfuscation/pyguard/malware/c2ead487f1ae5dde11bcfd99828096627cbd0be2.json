      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setuptools installation hook that executes a base64-decoded shell command during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. Specifically, the function 'notmalfunc' decodes a base64-encoded string (placeholder 'CODE_REPLACE') and immediately passes the decoded string to 'os.system', which executes it as a shell command. This pattern of decoding obfuscated data and executing it during installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery. The use of base64 encoding to hide the actual command, combined with execution in the install hook, strongly indicates an attempt to run arbitrary, potentially harmful code on the user's system during package installation. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, execution of arbitrary shell commands without validation, and abuse of setuptools install hooks for remote code execution. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
