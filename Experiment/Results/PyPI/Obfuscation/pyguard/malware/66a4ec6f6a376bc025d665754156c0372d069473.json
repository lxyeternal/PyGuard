      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be used as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. The setup call with a suspicious package name and no legitimate user interaction or business logic also aligns with supply chain attack patterns. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in hidden mode, lack of user consent, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
