      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely contains further instructions that are obfuscated to avoid static detection. This pattern—using subprocess to spawn PowerShell with encoded commands in hidden mode—is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious behavior, often used for executing payloads, privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading and running additional malware. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, which is benign, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution in the same script strongly indicates malicious intent."
