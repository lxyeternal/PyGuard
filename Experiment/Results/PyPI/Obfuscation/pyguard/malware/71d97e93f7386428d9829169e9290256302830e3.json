      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to run an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used to execute payloads, download further malware, or perform unauthorized actions without user consent. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and unauthorized code execution during installation."
