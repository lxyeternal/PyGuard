      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using eval, base64 decoding, and string encoding techniques. It dynamically imports critical functions like eval, compile, exec, and base64 decoding, then uses these to decode and execute compressed and encoded payloads. The code includes functions that decode and decompress data, then execute it immediately, which is a classic hallmark of malicious payload delivery. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code also appears to collect environment or user data (e.g., decoding browser cookies or system information) and then processes this data in a way consistent with credential stealing or data exfiltration malware. The absence of any legitimate user interaction, combined with the use of eval and exec on decoded data, and the presence of large base64-encoded blobs that are decompressed and executed, confirms that this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads without user consent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
