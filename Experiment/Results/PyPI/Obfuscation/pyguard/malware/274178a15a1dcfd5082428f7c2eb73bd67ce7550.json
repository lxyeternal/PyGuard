      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The Base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing easy inspection of its intent, which is a hallmark of malicious code. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
