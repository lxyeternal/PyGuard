      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute arbitrary decrypted code during package installation. Specifically, in the overridden method vTDpiEdmAtosPJzQiXOVLqfOyCCoOeFU, it checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, and executes code obtained by decrypting a hardcoded Fernet-encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during install time all strongly indicate malicious behavior. The setup call installs this custom install command, ensuring the malicious code runs automatically when the package is installed. There is no legitimate reason for executing decrypted arbitrary code during installation, especially without user notification or validation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
