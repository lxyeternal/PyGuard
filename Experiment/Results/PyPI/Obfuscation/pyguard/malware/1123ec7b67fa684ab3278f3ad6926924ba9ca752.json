      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly used for downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. Additionally, the setup call with a suspicious package name ('cabi0obwj5fez9oi') and the try/except blocks suppressing errors further indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity during package installation. These patterns align with known supply chain attacks and malware installation techniques."
