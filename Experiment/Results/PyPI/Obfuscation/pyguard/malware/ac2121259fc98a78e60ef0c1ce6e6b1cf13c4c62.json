      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the system's nodename, current user, current working directory, and a hardcoded package version string. It encodes this information in base64, then further obfuscates it by converting to hex and appending randomized prefixes. It constructs domain names with suspicious hardcoded domains (\"deliverycontent.online\" and its subdomain) that are attacker-controlled. The code then executes multiple shell commands using os.system to ping these constructed domain names, effectively sending encoded system information via DNS requests. Subsequently, it attempts multiple HTTP requests (GET and POST) to these suspicious domains, sending the encoded system information as query parameters or POST data. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as randomization, hex encoding, and base64 encoding to hide the data being exfiltrated. There is no user interaction or legitimate business logic, and the code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The behavior matches known malicious patterns of environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers, typical of information-stealing malware or backdoors. Therefore, this code is malicious."
