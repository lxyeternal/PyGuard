      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess to run obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often used for executing payloads, persistence, or downloading further malware. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a package installation script. These characteristics align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution of encoded shell commands without user consent."
