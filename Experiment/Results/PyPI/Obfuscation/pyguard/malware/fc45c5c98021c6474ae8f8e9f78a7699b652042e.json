      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and a hidden window style is a common stealth technique in malware to avoid user detection. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or malicious actions (e.g., downloading/executing payloads, persistence, or system compromise). Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The package name 'yh3lo97evby673zl' appears random and suspicious, consistent with malware naming patterns. The try-except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, conditional execution, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
