      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to perform malicious actions. During installation, it creates a temporary directory, downloads two executable files ('ComServer.exe' and 'dgdeskband64.dll') from suspicious, non-standard external URLs ('https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe' and 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll'), writes these files to the temporary directory, and then executes the downloaded executable with a shell command. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation without user consent or validation. The use of obfuscated class and function names, hardcoded suspicious URLs, writing and executing binaries from a temp folder, and execution triggered automatically on install are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction, no validation of downloaded content, and no benign purpose evident. This code is highly likely to be malware that downloads and runs a remote payload on the victim system during package installation."
