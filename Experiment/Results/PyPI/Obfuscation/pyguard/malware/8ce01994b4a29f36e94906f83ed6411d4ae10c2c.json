      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 decoding combined with zlib decompression to dynamically execute obfuscated Python code via exec during the package setup process. This decoded payload creates a socket connection to a hardcoded private IP address (192.168.43.113) on port 8080 and attempts to receive and execute further data. The use of obfuscation (base64 + zlib), dynamic code execution (exec), and network communication during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such behavior is typical of malware that establishes a backdoor or remote control channel on the victim system. The code runs automatically during installation without user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The suspicious package name and lack of legitimate functionality further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."
