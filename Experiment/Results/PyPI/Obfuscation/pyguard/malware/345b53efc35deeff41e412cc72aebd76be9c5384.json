      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method (likely the install method, but obfuscated as WAMWWlbUKQiofHeJFVZSdbVapCuTvKeY) to execute a subprocess call during package installation. This subprocess call runs a Python module ('poc_nvk.my_module') using the current Python interpreter. Executing arbitrary code during package installation without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated class and method names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The package name ('s6fl2b1mcmzfngiy') is suspicious and does not correspond to any known legitimate package. The code uses subprocess to spawn a process during install, which is a known vector for remote code execution and malware delivery. Given these factors and the lack of any benign context or legitimate purpose, this code exhibits malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including hostname, operating system name, and IP address, then automatically sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://eobngnpuin253ze.m.pipedream.net/poc) without any user interaction or consent. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The use of a suspicious, non-official external endpoint strongly suggests data exfiltration. This pattern of silent environment data collection and transmission to an attacker-controlled server is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code executes automatically when run, further indicating malicious intent."
