      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/284099f8-6eea-45be-9c3c-3b6b0f9ccb0e) without any user consent or notification. The class and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The code executes automatically during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Collecting and exfiltrating user and environment data silently during install is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically information stealing or reconnaissance. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script, and the use of a hardcoded external webhook URL strongly indicates malicious intent."
