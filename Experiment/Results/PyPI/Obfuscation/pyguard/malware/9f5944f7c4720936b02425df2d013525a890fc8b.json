      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It performs an HTTP GET request to a legitimate site (baidu.com) but more importantly, it defines and executes a shell command via subprocess.run with shell=True that sends a POST request to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://43.139.166.32). This POST request exfiltrates sensitive system information including hostname, current user, current directory listing, security groups, user directory listing, contents of /etc/passwd, and the user's bash history. This is done silently during the package setup phase without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated variable and function names, the execution of shell commands during installation, and the exfiltration of sensitive environment and user data to an attacker-controlled server are hallmark indicators of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware."
