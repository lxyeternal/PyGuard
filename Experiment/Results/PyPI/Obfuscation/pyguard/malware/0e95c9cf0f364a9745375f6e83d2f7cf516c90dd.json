      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag suppresses any visible window, enabling stealthy execution. The encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as is common in malware. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns including obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of installation hooks for remote code execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
