      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It uses dynamic attribute access and string construction to evade static analysis. The code conditionally imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', attempts to create and write files in user or system directories, and uses Windows COM interfaces to create and save shortcuts. It performs directory walking and file operations targeting specific file extensions, likely to propagate or execute payloads. The code checks for administrative privileges and uses Windows-specific APIs, indicating environment awareness and potential privilege escalation. The obfuscation, combined with file system manipulation, dynamic code execution during package setup, and use of Windows COM objects to create shortcuts, strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines. These patterns match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution during package installation, environment reconnaissance, file creation in sensitive locations, and use of Windows automation interfaces for persistence or payload execution."
