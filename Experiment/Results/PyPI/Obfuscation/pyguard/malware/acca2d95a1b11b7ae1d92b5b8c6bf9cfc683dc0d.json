      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to run stealthily without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The setup call with a suspicious, random-looking package name ('k4bwgowhssrchydk') and the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup strongly suggests a supply chain attack vector. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
