      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary file named 'node' from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node) and writes it to the /tmp directory without any user consent or validation. It then sets executable permissions on this file and executes it immediately via a shell command. This sequence of downloading an executable from an untrusted remote source and running it directly is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for payload delivery or remote code execution. The function name is obfuscated, and the code runs automatically during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user interaction, or integrity checks, combined with the use of a suspicious URL and execution of a downloaded binary in a temporary directory, strongly indicates malicious intent."
