      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect Discord and various browser authentication tokens from local storage directories on the victim's machine. It searches for files with extensions '.log' and '.ldb' in specific application data folders related to Discord, Chrome, Opera, Brave, and Yandex browsers. It uses regex patterns to extract Discord tokens and multi-factor authentication tokens from these files. The collected tokens are then formatted and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive user credentials without any user consent or notification. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to evade detection. It automatically executes this data collection and exfiltration upon running, with no legitimate user interaction or business logic. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious code, including credential theft, data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints, obfuscation, and automated background execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
