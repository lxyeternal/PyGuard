      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install_scripts command class with obfuscated names and performs suspicious actions during installation. It collects detailed environment information including hostname, current working directory, and the public IP address by querying external services. It then encodes this information and sends DNS queries to a hardcoded suspicious domain 'tkhifq33bf1r414tr9fqnn06txznnc.burpcollaborator.net', which is a known attacker-controlled domain used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration. This behavior is consistent with host fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration. The code executes automatically during package installation (via the setup hook), without user consent or notification, which is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The obfuscated variable and function names, combined with network communication to a suspicious domain and environment data collection, strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the code attempts to stealthily leak system information to an external attacker-controlled server. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects detailed environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and the external IP address of the host by querying external services. It then encodes this information into hexadecimal form and sends DNS queries to a suspicious, hardcoded domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net', which is a known domain used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration in penetration testing and malware. The obfuscated variable names and the use of DNS queries for data exfiltration are classic malware techniques to stealthily leak information. The code does not require user interaction and silently performs network communication to an attacker-controlled domain, which strongly suggests it is designed for reconnaissance and data exfiltration. There is also a misleading print statement indicating a security test, likely to disguise its true intent. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as environment discovery, data encoding, and covert exfiltration to a command-and-control server."
