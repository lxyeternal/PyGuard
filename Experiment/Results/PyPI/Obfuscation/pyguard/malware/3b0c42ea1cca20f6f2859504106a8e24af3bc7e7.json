      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the Python package installation process (setup script) to execute code during 'build', 'egg_info', 'bdist_wheel', and 'install' commands on Windows platforms. It attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package silently if missing, then creates a hidden Chrome extension in the user's APPDATA directory under 'Extension', writing obfuscated JavaScript code that repeatedly replaces clipboard contents with specific cryptocurrency addresses. It then searches common user and system shortcut directories (Start Menu, Taskbar, Desktop) for shortcuts to popular browsers (chrome.exe, msedge.exe, brave.exe, launcher.exe) and modifies their command-line arguments to load the malicious extension on browser startup. This behavior is a classic clipboard hijacker technique aimed at replacing cryptocurrency addresses copied by the user with attacker-controlled addresses to steal funds. The obfuscated JavaScript code, stealthy installation without user consent, modification of browser shortcuts for persistence, and execution during package installation are all hallmark signs of malware, specifically a clipboard hijacker targeting Windows users. Such actions are not legitimate for a setup script and indicate a supply chain attack vector. Therefore, the code is malicious."
