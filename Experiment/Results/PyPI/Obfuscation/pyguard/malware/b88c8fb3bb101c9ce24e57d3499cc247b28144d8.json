      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated commands, commonly used in malware for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The subprocess is created with the flag CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The code is embedded in a try-except block without error reporting, which is typical for malicious code to avoid crashing or revealing its presence. Additionally, the setup() call with a suspicious package name ('vl17d6gis827nezo') and unrelated classifiers appears to be a decoy or a method to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package installation script, a common supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the obfuscated PowerShell command strongly suggests malicious intent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
