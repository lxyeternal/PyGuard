      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or consent, and writes it to the local filesystem as 'discomusic.exe'. This behavior is a classic indicator of malware, as it fetches a potentially untrusted binary from a remote source and saves it locally, which could then be executed to compromise the system. The variable name is obfuscated, and there is no validation or user notification before writing the file. Such automated downloading and saving of executables from suspicious or non-official URLs is strongly associated with malicious payload delivery, remote code execution, and malware propagation."
