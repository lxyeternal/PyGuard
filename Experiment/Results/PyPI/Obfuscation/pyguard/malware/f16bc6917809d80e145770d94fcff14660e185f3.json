      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads a Kubernetes service account token from a sensitive file path (/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token), which is typically used for authentication within Kubernetes clusters. It then collects environment information such as the expanded user home directory and current working directory. This collected data is serialized into JSON, base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious URL constructed as 'https://pypi.org/reqs?d=' plus the encoded data, but with a forged 'Host' header pointing to 'psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'. This behavior indicates automated, silent collection and exfiltration of sensitive authentication tokens and environment information without user consent or notification. The obfuscated variable and function names, combined with the covert data exfiltration to a non-standard endpoint, strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with credential theft or environment reconnaissance malware. There is no legitimate or benign reason for this code to collect Kubernetes tokens and send them encoded to an external server disguised under a forged Host header. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
