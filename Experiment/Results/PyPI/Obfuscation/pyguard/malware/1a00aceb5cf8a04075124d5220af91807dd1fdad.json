      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large base64-encoded payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The code uses obfuscated variable and class names, imports modules commonly used in malware (requests, fernet), and executes arbitrary code without user consent or interaction during package installation. The presence of this behavior in a setup script strongly indicates that the package is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads on the victim's system during installation, which is a critical risk and a classic supply chain attack vector."
