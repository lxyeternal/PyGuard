      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in supply chain attacks. The code uses obfuscated variable and class names, imports network-related modules, and executes hidden code without user consent or interaction. The decrypted code is not visible in the source, indicating it likely contains further malicious payload or actions. Executing arbitrary decrypted code during package installation is a strong indicator of remote code execution and potential system compromise. Therefore, this code is malicious."
