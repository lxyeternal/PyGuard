      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function that collects all environment variables from the host system and encodes them as URL parameters. It then attempts to send this encoded environment data via an HTTP request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app), which is an attacker-controlled domain often used for tunneling and exfiltration. This function is called immediately at the end of the script and also hooked into the setuptools install and develop commands, causing it to execute automatically during package installation or development setup without user consent or notification. The obfuscated function and variable names, combined with the exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data to an external server during package installation, are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior aligns with known supply chain attack patterns where malicious code is executed during package installation to steal environment information and possibly prepare for further exploitation."
