      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a GitHub raw URL hosting 'test.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable to the current working directory with an obfuscated filename ('tmp_file_pypi_29x7d0kf8.exe'), then immediately executes it via a shell command. After execution, it deletes the executable file silently. This behavior is triggered automatically upon running the script (or during package installation), without any validation, integrity checks, or user notification. The obfuscated function and variable names, combined with the direct download and execution of a remote binary, are classic hallmarks of malicious code, specifically a supply chain attack or malware payload delivery. The use of the setuptools 'setup' call alongside this automatic execution further indicates an attempt to hide malicious activity within a package installation process. There is no legitimate business logic or benign reason for this pattern, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and stealthy execution with self-deletion."
