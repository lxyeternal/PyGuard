      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that is decoded and immediately executed using exec and compile on import. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then writes a temporary file with code that fetches and executes remote code from a suspicious URL ('https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/hzzzp/raw'). This pattern of decoding obfuscated code and executing it at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The use of setuptools setup with obfuscated variable names and suspicious package metadata further supports malicious intent. The code downloads and executes remote code during package installation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code is strongly indicative of malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed immediately at import time using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload performs a network request to a suspicious external URL ('https://rentry.co/7nqxy/raw'), reads its content, writes it to a temporary file, and then executes a shell command that starts a process with a title derived from the executed file. This sequence of decoding, writing, and executing remote code without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malware, specifically a remote code execution and payload delivery mechanism. Additionally, the code uses obfuscated class and function names, imports system modules for shell command execution, and performs environment-specific commands (e.g., 'cls' or 'clear'). The presence of threading and cursor hiding functions further suggests attempts to evade user detection. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as dynamic code execution from remote sources, obfuscation, network communication to suspicious domains, and execution of arbitrary shell commands, confirming it is malicious."
