      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques, including base64 encoding and decoding, and dynamic execution of decoded code via eval and compile, which is a classic malware technique to hide payloads and evade detection. The code fetches content from suspicious, hardcoded URLs (e.g., raw.githubusercontent.com, discord.com API endpoints, and other obfuscated URLs), downloads and writes files to user or system directories without user consent, and replaces content in these files. It collects sensitive user data such as usernames, user IDs, email, phone, and potentially browser or Discord data, then exfiltrates this information to attacker-controlled servers via HTTP requests. The code also uses threading to execute background tasks, likely to evade detection and maintain persistence. The presence of obfuscated variable names, encoded PowerShell commands, and network communication to suspicious endpoints further confirms malicious intent. The code executes arbitrary code during package installation or runtime without user interaction or validation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, unauthorized data collection, network exfiltration, dynamic code execution, and stealth techniques clearly classifies this code as malicious."

The code fetches content from suspicious, hardcoded URLs (e.g., raw.githubusercontent.com, discord.com API endpoints, and other obfuscated URLs), indicating remote code retrieval and potential command-and-control communication. It writes files to user or system directories without user consent, replaces content in files, and executes downloaded or decoded code dynamically. The presence of threading to run background tasks, collection of user and environment data (including usernames, user IDs, and environment variables), and sending this data to external servers strongly suggests data exfiltration. The code also uses obfuscated variable and function names, making analysis and detection harder. The combination of these factors—dynamic remote code execution, data collection and exfiltration, obfuscation, and execution during package installation or runtime—matches multiple critical risk patterns exclusively observed in malware samples. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely designed for credential theft, remote code execution, and stealthy persistence."
