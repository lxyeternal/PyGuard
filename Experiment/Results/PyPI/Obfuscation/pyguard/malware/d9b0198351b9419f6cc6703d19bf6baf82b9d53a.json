      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and system information by accessing environment variables and user directories (e.g., APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, TEMP). It decrypts stored browser credentials using Windows cryptographic APIs and extracts Discord user information and billing details via Discord API calls using stolen tokens. The code exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common technique for covert data transmission to attacker-controlled infrastructure. It uses obfuscated variable and function names, base64 decoding, and threading to evade detection and perform background data collection and exfiltration without user consent or interaction. The code also attempts to install missing dependencies silently and uses subprocess calls to kill processes and manipulate files, further indicating malicious intent. Overall, the code is a sophisticated information stealer designed to harvest and transmit sensitive credentials and user data stealthily."
