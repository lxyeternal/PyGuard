      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class that overrides the install process to download an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe') and then immediately executes it on the user's system without any user interaction or consent. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The download and execution of an untrusted binary during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this behavior. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a critical risk indicator of remote code execution and payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
