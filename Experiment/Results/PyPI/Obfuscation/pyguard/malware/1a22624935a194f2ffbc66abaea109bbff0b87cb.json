      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'), then imports 'requests' and a module named 'fernet'. It uses the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This decrypted code is not visible in the source, indicating obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Executing decrypted code during package installation without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation (encrypted payload), dynamic execution (exec), and network-related imports (requests) strongly indicates malicious intent. The package name and variables are obfuscated and nonsensical, further suggesting evasion. This pattern matches known malicious behaviors such as remote code execution during install, code obfuscation, and potential data exfiltration or payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
