      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to retrieve a Google Cloud instance service account token by querying the metadata server at the IP address 169.254.169.254, which is a well-known internal IP for cloud instance metadata. It sends a GET request with the required 'Metadata-Flavor: Google' header to obtain the token. If successful, it then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log), which is likely attacker-controlled. This behavior constitutes unauthorized collection and exfiltration of sensitive credential information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The obfuscated variable names and the lack of user interaction or notification further support the malicious intent. Such direct extraction and exfiltration of cloud instance tokens is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware, enabling attackers to potentially escalate privileges or access cloud resources. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
