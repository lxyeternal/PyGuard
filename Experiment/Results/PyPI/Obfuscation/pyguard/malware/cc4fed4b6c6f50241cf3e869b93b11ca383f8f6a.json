      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during the setup phase strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for executing hidden payloads or performing unauthorized actions on the system. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask the malicious behavior within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
