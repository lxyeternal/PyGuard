      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a shell command that is executed during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). The decoded shell command installs the 'requests' Python package, then runs a Python script 'main.pyw' multiple times, which itself imports 'requests' and performs a GET request to a suspicious GitHub URL that appears to be a raw executable file ('ip_checker.exe'). The script writes the downloaded content to a file named 'STEALER.exe' and then executes it. This sequence indicates a supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is executed during package installation without user consent, downloading and running a potentially malicious executable. The use of base64 encoding to hide the shell command, execution of shell commands during install, downloading and executing an external executable, and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
