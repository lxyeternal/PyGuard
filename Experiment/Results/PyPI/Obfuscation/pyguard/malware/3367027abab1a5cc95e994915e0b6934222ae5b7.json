      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64 decoding to hide the actual payload, which is then compiled and executed dynamically via exec. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then downloads and executes code from suspicious hardcoded IP addresses (http://20.226.18.203). It attempts to execute remote code named 'ry2K1CIVRSFa59vT' and 'clip' from this external source without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution, and network communication to attacker-controlled IPs are classic hallmarks of malware. The code also tries to start execution in a way that suppresses output and uses try-except blocks to evade detection. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious."
