      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The obfuscated variable names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution of decrypted code without user consent or validation strongly indicate malicious intent. The setup script also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting the conclusion that the package is designed to execute hidden malicious code during installation."
