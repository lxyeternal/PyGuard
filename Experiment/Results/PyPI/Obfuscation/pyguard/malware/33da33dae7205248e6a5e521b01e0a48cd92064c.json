      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, which are used only in the malicious install hook, suggesting these dependencies are installed solely to support the malicious payload execution. Overall, this is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential further compromise."
