      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that registers an atexit handler function which executes automatically at the end of the installation process. This function writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with the content 'proof bug by kotko' to the current directory without user consent. It then collects sensitive environment information: the public IP address of the host (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current script directory (URL-encoded). This collected data is concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with obfuscated query parameters. The obfuscation of variable names, the use of base64 encoding to hide the data being exfiltrated, and the automatic execution of this code during package installation are strong indicators of malicious intent. The code performs silent data exfiltration of system information without user interaction or notification, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
