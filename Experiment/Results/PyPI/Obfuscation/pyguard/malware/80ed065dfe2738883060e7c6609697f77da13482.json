      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that immediately executes a shell command to download a file from a suspicious, non-standard, attacker-controlled domain (https://kymslgsrz9xelqdvm7uxogrrnit9ha5z.oastify.com/test) using 'wget'. This function is called during the package setup process, meaning the download occurs automatically upon installation without user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware, as it leverages the installation process to fetch potentially malicious payloads from an untrusted external source. The use of an obfuscated function name and the direct execution of a shell command to download external content without validation or user notification strongly indicates malicious intent."
