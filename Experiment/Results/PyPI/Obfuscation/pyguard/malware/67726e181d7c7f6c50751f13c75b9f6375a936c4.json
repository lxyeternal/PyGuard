      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains obfuscated variable and function names and uses a custom decoding function that manipulates character codes and then executes the decoded string with eval, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of eval on dynamically decoded data is a classic technique for hiding and executing arbitrary code. Additionally, the code imports setuptools and immediately executes a shell command via os.system('whoami') during the setup process, which is unusual and suspicious behavior in a package installation context. Executing shell commands during package setup without user interaction or consent is a known vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. The obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution and shell command execution during installation strongly indicates malicious behavior."
