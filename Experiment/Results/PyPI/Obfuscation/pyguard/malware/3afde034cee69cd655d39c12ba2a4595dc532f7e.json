      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW' suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The encoded PowerShell command is not human-readable and is likely to perform unauthorized or harmful actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, or system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, which is typical in malware to avoid raising suspicion. The rest of the code is a standard setup call with no suspicious behavior, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution in the installation script is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
