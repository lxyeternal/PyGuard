      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary file containing a Python command that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/pq3s7/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using the Python interpreter in a new process via os.system with a Windows-specific 'start' command. This pattern of dynamically fetching and executing remote code during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The code uses obfuscated variable names and performs code execution without user consent or validation, which is a critical risk indicator. The setup call appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code enables remote code execution from an untrusted source during package installation, which is a hallmark of malware."
