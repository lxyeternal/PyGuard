      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which means it executes automatically during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The script collects sensitive environment information including AWS IAM security credentials by querying the AWS metadata service, reads AWS credentials files, SSH keys, environment files (.env), and system details such as hostname, current working directory, username, and IP address. It then aggregates this sensitive data and writes it to a randomly named text file in the current directory without user consent or notification. Subsequently, it exfiltrates this data by sending HTTP POST requests with the collected information and the file to suspicious external servers (http://graph.pygrata.com:8000/upload and http://graphs.pygrata.com/api.php). The code also performs DNS queries to attacker-controlled domains derived from encoded usernames, likely for tracking or command-and-control purposes. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding/decoding, subprocess calls to execute shell commands, and network communication to unknown external endpoints without any legitimate user interaction or business logic further confirms malicious intent. These behaviors align with credential theft, environment reconnaissance, and data exfiltration malware patterns, making this code highly malicious."
