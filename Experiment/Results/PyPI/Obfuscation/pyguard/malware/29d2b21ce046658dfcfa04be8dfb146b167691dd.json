      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable names and base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically via exec, a classic technique for hiding malicious intent. The decoded payload imports 'requests' and 'subprocess', fetches a remote URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/accounts/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe), writes the downloaded content to a temporary file, and executes it as a subprocess. This sequence is a hallmark of malware that downloads and runs a remote executable without user consent. Additionally, the code runs automatically during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of a suspicious package name ('wepsnefbornoq6uj'), the check for a local file to evade repeated execution, and the immediate exit after execution further confirm malicious intent. Overall, this code downloads and executes a remote binary silently during installation, which is a critical security risk."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109115014054416495/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe) without any user interaction or validation, writes it to a temporary file, and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware: automated retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote source. The use of obfuscated variable names further suggests an attempt to evade detection. There is no indication of user consent, integrity checks, or legitimate business logic. Executing a remote binary in this manner can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or payload delivery. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk and is strongly indicative of malicious behavior."
