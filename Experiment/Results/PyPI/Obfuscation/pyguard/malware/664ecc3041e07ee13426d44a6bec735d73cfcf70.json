      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable names and creates a suspicious directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' which mimics a system folder but is non-standard and likely intended to hide files. It downloads two executable files from hardcoded, attacker-controlled Discord CDN URLs without any user interaction or consent. These executables are saved into the suspicious directory with obfuscated filenames and then immediately executed using os.startfile. The code attempts to remove the downloaded executables from the current directory after moving them, and finally tries to delete the entire suspicious directory, likely to cover tracks. The use of requests to fetch executables, writing them to disk in a hidden location, and executing them without validation or user consent is a classic malware pattern for payload delivery and execution. The presence of this code in a setup script further suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code runs automatically during package installation. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the behavior matches known malware patterns such as automated download and execution of untrusted binaries, obfuscation, and stealthy file operations."
