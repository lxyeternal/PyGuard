      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large base64-encoded payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during package installation strongly indicate that this code is designed to run hidden malicious code on the victim's system during package installation. The presence of 'requests' suggests potential network activity, possibly for data exfiltration or further payload retrieval. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and execution during package installation."
