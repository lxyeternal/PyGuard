      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, writes a Python script named 'remote-access.py' containing a reverse shell command that opens a bash interactive shell connected to a hardcoded IP address (10.3.0.95) on port 4444. It then moves this script to the user's home directory and executes it silently in the background without any user interaction or notification. This behavior is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor technique, enabling an attacker to gain unauthorized remote shell access to the victim's machine. The use of setuptools install hook to execute this code during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. The hardcoded IP and port, silent file creation and execution, and reverse shell command are strong indicators of malicious intent."
