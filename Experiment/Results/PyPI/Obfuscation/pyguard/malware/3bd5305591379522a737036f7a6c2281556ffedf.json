      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious payloads. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag and WindowStyle Hidden, indicating an attempt to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a staging or persistence check. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly used for executing payloads, downloading further malware, or performing unauthorized actions. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup."
