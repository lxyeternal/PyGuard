      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string using subprocess.Popen. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads, commonly observed in malware. The obfuscated command string is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell code, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent as it hides the true nature of the command. The subprocess is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. Additionally, the code is wrapped in try/except blocks to suppress errors and avoid raising suspicion. The setup() call with suspicious package name 't46sxdjqhety3o7b' and unrelated classifiers appears to be a decoy or part of a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution based on file system state, and suspicious packaging metadata strongly indicates malicious behavior."
