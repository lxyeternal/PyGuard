      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command in a Python package setup script that, upon installation, automatically downloads an executable file named 'DigitalPulse.exe' from a hardcoded, non-standard external URL ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using a shell command ('start DigitalPulse.exe') on Windows platforms. This behavior is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware, as it hijacks the package installation process to silently fetch and run potentially untrusted and harmful code. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic, combined with the direct download and execution of an external binary during install, strongly indicates malicious intent."
