      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command that renames the system 'ls' binary in /usr/local/bin to 'ls_101', then downloads a file named 'ls' from a hardcoded IP address (159.89.160.135) using wget, saves it to /usr/local/bin/ls, and makes it executable. This sequence effectively replaces a standard system utility with a potentially malicious binary fetched from an untrusted external source without any user interaction or consent. Such behavior is a classic indicator of malware attempting to install a backdoor or trojanized binary to gain persistence or control over the system. The use of a hardcoded IP address, direct shell command execution, and replacement of a critical system binary are strong indicators of malicious intent."
