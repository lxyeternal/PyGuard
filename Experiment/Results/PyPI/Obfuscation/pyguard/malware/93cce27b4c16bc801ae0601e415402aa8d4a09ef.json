      "malicious_behavior": "The code constructs and executes a shell command via subprocess with shell=True that uses curl to send an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eot0n2yp3autvqq.m.pipedream.net). The headers and POST data include sensitive system information such as the hostname, current user (whoami), current working directory (pwd), directory listing (ls -la), and security groups (id). This is done without any user interaction or consent, indicating automated data exfiltration. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The behavior matches known malicious patterns of environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code runs automatically when executed. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides an install method with an obfuscated name. During installation, it calls a function named 'LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP' imported from a module 'pre_install'. Both the function and module names are obfuscated and provide no clear indication of legitimate behavior. The setup metadata uses a suspicious package name 'aibl0dtrt1g94h7k' and a non-standard download URL 'http://notapplicdable.notdapplicable', which is not a valid or trusted source. The install hook executes code during package installation without user interaction or consent, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. The obfuscation and execution of an unknown function during install strongly indicate malicious intent, as legitimate packages do not execute arbitrary code on install without clear purpose or transparency. This pattern matches known malicious behaviors involving code execution during package installation, obfuscation, and use of suspicious URLs and names."
