      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code imports the base64 module and immediately executes a large base64-decoded string using exec. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the code. The decoded payload is not visible directly, but the use of exec on base64-decoded data is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Such patterns are almost exclusively observed in malware samples, as they enable arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources, bypassing static detection. The code lacks any user interaction or legitimate business logic and executes the decoded payload immediately, which is typical for malware that delivers and runs hidden or dynamically generated payloads. Given the extensive knowledge points, this pattern is a definitive indicator of malicious intent."
