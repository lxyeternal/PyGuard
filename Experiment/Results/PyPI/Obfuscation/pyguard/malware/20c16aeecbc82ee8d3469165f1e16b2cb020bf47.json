      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes Python code into it that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://rentry.co/ki74h/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This is a classic pattern of remote code execution from an untrusted source without any user interaction or validation. The code then attempts to execute the temporary file using the Python interpreter in a new process via a shell command. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temporary file, and immediate execution of downloaded code are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of dynamic payload delivery, remote code execution, and potential system compromise. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in benign software, and the absence of any user consent or validation further confirms the malicious nature."
