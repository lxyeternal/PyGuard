      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. Specifically, during the execution of the read_version() function, it collects detailed system and network information including the hostname (platform.node()), system details (platform.uname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and network interface IP addresses (via 'ifconfig' shell command). This collected data is concatenated into a string, then base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://1.15.77.2/v/). This sequence is a classic data exfiltration pattern, performed silently without user consent or notification. Additionally, the code spawns a subprocess running a script named 'version' located in the same directory as the '__init__.py' file, but the purpose of this subprocess is unclear and may be used for further malicious activity or environment probing. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the transmitted data, the hardcoded external IP address, and the automatic network communication during package setup strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malware embedded in the package installation process. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this behavior, and the code is designed to execute automatically during setup, which is a known vector for malicious code execution. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
