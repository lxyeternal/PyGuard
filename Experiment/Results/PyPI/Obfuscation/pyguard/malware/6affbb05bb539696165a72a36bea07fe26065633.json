      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed immediately via exec during the package setup process. This payload performs a network request to a suspicious URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/hEF5HaFc), retrieves data, writes it to a file named 'pkg_installer.exe', and executes it via a shell command. The use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, execution of arbitrary code during installation, downloading and running an executable without user consent, and the use of a non-official external URL are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known supply chain attack techniques where malicious code is executed during package installation to download and run further malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
