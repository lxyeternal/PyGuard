      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is highly obfuscated using base64 encoding and executes the decoded payload immediately via exec. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the code and executes it without any user interaction or validation. The decoded payload is extremely large and appears to contain multiple layers of obfuscation and encoded data, which is typical of malware attempting to evade detection. The use of exec on base64-decoded data is a classic technique for delivering and running malicious payloads, enabling remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Given the extensive obfuscation, immediate execution of decoded code, and lack of any benign context or user consent, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware."
