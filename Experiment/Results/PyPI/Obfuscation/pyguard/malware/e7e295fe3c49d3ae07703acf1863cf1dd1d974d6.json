      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly observed in malware for executing payloads, downloading further malicious code, or performing system compromise without user consent or notification. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
