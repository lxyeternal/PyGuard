      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses extensive obfuscation techniques, including multiple layers of base64 and marshal decoding combined with zlib decompression, followed by immediate execution via exec(). This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to hide its true functionality. The code imports modules commonly used in malicious scripts (e.g., telethon for Telegram interaction, requests for network communication, marshal for code serialization, base64, zlib for obfuscation). It defines functions with obfuscated names that execute large blocks of decoded and decompressed code, indicating dynamic payload execution. The asynchronous function listens for a specific command ('webshare') and then executes similarly obfuscated code, sends files, and deletes messages, which suggests command-and-control behavior and attempts to hide activity. The code lacks any legitimate user interaction or business logic and is designed to execute hidden, obfuscated payloads, likely for data exfiltration or remote control. These behaviors, combined with the absence of any benign context and the use of known malicious patterns (e.g., direct exec of decoded payloads, network communication, file sending, and deletion), confirm that this code is malicious."
