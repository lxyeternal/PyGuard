      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (via os.getcwd()), and the username of the current user (via getpass.getuser()). It then sends this collected information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eomreq4blox8fea.m.pipedream.net) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a package installation script to silently collect and transmit such environment data to an external server. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
