      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during installation, creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (85.159.212.47) on port 61985. It then redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket and spawns a new interactive shell (/bin/sh) connected to the remote socket. This effectively creates a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. The code is triggered automatically during package installation without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack technique. The obfuscated class and variable names, the use of setuptools install hook for code execution, and the hardcoded external IP address for remote shell connection are strong indicators of malicious intent."
