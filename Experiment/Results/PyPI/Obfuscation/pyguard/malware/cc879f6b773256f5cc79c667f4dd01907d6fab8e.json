      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the hostname, current user, a hardcoded string, and the current working directory, then encodes this information in base64. It then obfuscates this encoded data by converting it to hex and prepends random values. The code constructs domain names using suspicious hardcoded domains (e.g., 'deliverycontent.online' and its subdomain) and performs multiple 'ping' shell commands to these constructed domain names, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. Subsequently, it sends HTTP requests (both GET and POST) to these suspicious domains, transmitting the encoded and obfuscated system information without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscation, environment data collection, shell command execution, and network exfiltration to attacker-controlled domains are hallmark behaviors of malware, specifically information-stealing or staging malware. The code also uses try-except blocks to suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the domains used are not standard or known benign endpoints. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including environment reconnaissance, data exfiltration, obfuscation, and covert network communication."
