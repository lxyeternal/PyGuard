      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that registers an atexit handler function. This handler function, executed automatically at program exit (which includes installation completion), performs several suspicious actions: it creates/appends a file named 'bykotko.txt' in the current directory and writes the string 'kotko' to it without user consent or notification. It then silently collects sensitive environment information: the public IP address of the host (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the script's directory (URL-encoded). This collected data is concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with obfuscated query parameters. The obfuscation of variable names, the use of base64 encoding to hide the data being exfiltrated, and the automatic execution of this code during package installation (via setuptools install hook) are strong indicators of malicious intent. The code performs data exfiltration without user interaction or consent, uses obfuscation to hide its purpose, and contacts an attacker-controlled server. These behaviors align with known supply chain attack patterns and information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
