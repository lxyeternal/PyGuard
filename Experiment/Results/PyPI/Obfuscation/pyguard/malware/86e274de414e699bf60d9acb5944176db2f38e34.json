      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes arbitrary shell commands during package installation without user consent or notification. It installs the 'requests' package, then performs multiple HTTP GET requests to suspicious, hardcoded URLs including 'https://chef.csa.eyrie.cloud/chef/validation.pem' and environment-dependent URLs constructed from 'EL_FAAS_PORT_9000_TCP_ADDR' and 'EL_FAAS_SERVICE_HOST'. These requests include a hardcoded 'Proxy-Authorization' header with a base64-encoded credential, indicating potential use of a proxy for stealth or exfiltration. The responses from these requests are appended to a LICENSE file, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The code also unsets proxy environment variables before making requests, possibly to evade detection or routing controls. It creates a file '/tmp/pytest2' without legitimate reason, which is a suspicious side effect. The obfuscated class and method names, combined with the execution of shell commands during installation, network communication to attacker-controlled domains, and writing of fetched data to local files, are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation to perform reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or payload delivery. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying these actions, and the code suppresses output and errors, further indicating stealthy malicious behavior."
