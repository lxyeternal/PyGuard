      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads to be executed silently. Additionally, the use of subprocess.Popen to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The rest of the code calls setup() from distutils.core with a suspiciously random package name, which may be an attempt to disguise or deliver the malicious payload during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in hidden mode, lack of user consent, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
