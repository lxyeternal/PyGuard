      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes during package installation. It retrieves the current Windows user login name and constructs a path inside the user's Startup folder. It then uses the gitpython library to clone a GitHub repository (https://github.com/dcsage/test2lmaos.git) into a subdirectory of the Startup folder. After cloning, it renames a Python script from the cloned repository ('test.py') into the Startup folder itself. This behavior effectively installs a script to run automatically on user login without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and method names, the automatic network retrieval of code during installation, writing files to a sensitive system location (Startup folder), and setting up persistence by placing executable code in the Startup folder are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and persistence on the victim system triggered by package installation. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying these actions, and the code silently downloads and stages potentially untrusted code for execution on system startup."
