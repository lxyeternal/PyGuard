      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and WindowStyle Hidden suppresses any visible window, which is a known stealth technique. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, as is common in malware. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further hiding malicious activity. These factors combined—obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, conditional execution, and embedding in a setup script—are strong indicators of malicious behavior."
