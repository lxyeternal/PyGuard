      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines obfuscated function and variable names, which is a common evasion technique. The function esWkCMNUNFKHQPiErbNIZFpTAKDZaimA() attempts to create a reverse shell by connecting to a hardcoded external IP address (59.110.111.85) on port 8088, then redirects standard input/output/error to the socket and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine. The function ZJkRSwczSAXDUqzVgSSqnJVcyzsNdsks() forks the process and runs the reverse shell in the child process, enabling stealthy background execution. The code also creates a file /tmp/test1563.txt as a marker to avoid repeated execution of the reverse shell. The entire payload is triggered automatically at import or setup time without any user interaction or consent, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious packages. The use of obfuscated names, hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port, spawning of a reverse shell, and background process creation collectively confirm that this code is malicious."
