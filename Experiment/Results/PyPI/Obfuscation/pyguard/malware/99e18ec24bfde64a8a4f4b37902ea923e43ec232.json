      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware to execute payloads stealthily, perform privilege escalation, or download and run further malicious code. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be used as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. The setup() call with a suspicious package name and version appears to be a decoy or to disguise the malicious activity within a package installation context, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and packaging context strongly indicates malicious behavior."
