      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It creates a suspicious hidden directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' in the Windows system drive, which is not a standard or benign location. It downloads two executable files from hardcoded external URLs hosted on Discord's CDN, writes them into this hidden directory with obfuscated filenames, and then executes these downloaded executables immediately without any user interaction or consent. The code also attempts to remove these executables and the directory afterward, indicating an attempt to cover tracks. The use of obfuscated variable names, automatic installation of dependencies, and execution of untrusted remote binaries are classic hallmarks of malware, specifically a multi-stage payload downloader and executor. This behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks or remote code execution malware that downloads and runs arbitrary payloads silently on the victim system."
