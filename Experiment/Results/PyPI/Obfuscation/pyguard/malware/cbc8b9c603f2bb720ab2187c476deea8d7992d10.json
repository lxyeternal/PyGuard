      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess.Popen to run obfuscated PowerShell commands in hidden mode is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used to download, execute, or stage further payloads without user consent or notification. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspicious package name and version, but this part appears benign or a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in hidden mode triggered automatically during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
