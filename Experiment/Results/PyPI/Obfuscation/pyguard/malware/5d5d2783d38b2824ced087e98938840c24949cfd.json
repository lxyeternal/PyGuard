      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious payloads. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to evade repeated execution or detection. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it involves obfuscated code execution in a hidden context without user interaction or consent. Additionally, the use of such encoded PowerShell commands in setup scripts is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign but is wrapped in a try-except block, possibly to suppress errors and avoid raising suspicion. Overall, the presence of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during module import or setup indicates malicious intent."
