      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppressing errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these behaviors align with known malware patterns involving obfuscated code execution, stealthy process spawning, and potential payload delivery or system compromise."
