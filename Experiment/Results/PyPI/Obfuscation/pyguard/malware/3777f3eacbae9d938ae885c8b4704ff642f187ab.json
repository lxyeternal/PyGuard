      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated execution or detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the use of encoded PowerShell commands in hidden mode is a well-known hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for stealthy execution of payloads, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further malicious code. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
