      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It performs an HTTP GET request to a legitimate site (baidu.com) but more critically, it defines a function that executes a shell command via subprocess.run with shell=True. This shell command uses curl to send a POST request to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://43.139.166.32:8080) with HTTP headers containing sensitive system information collected via shell command substitutions: hostname, current user (whoami), present working directory (pwd), directory listing (ls -la), user id info (id), user home directory listing (ls ~), contents of /etc/passwd, installed NPM modules (npm ls), and the first lines of the bash history file (~/.bash_history). This is a clear attempt to collect and exfiltrate sensitive environment and user data without user consent. The function that performs this exfiltration is defined but not called explicitly in the snippet; however, its presence in the setup script context is suspicious because setup scripts can be executed during package installation, enabling supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated variable and function names further suggests an attempt to evade detection. The combination of environment discovery, data collection, and automated exfiltration to a hardcoded external IP address, especially during package setup, is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks and data-stealing malware."
