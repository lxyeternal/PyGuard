      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated and base64-encoded strings combined with compression to hide the true content of URLs and data. It retrieves user login information without consent and sends encoded data to remote servers via HTTPS connections. The code dynamically decodes and decompresses data fetched from obfuscated endpoints, then uses this data to construct HTTP requests to attacker-controlled servers. The obfuscation of function and variable names, the use of reversed base64-encoded strings, and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification further support malicious intent. The pattern of collecting user identity information and exfiltrating it to remote hosts, combined with obfuscated network communication, is a hallmark of information-stealing or staging malware. The code attempts to communicate with suspicious, hardcoded remote endpoints and sends encoded user data without validation or consent, which is consistent with credential theft or data exfiltration malware."
