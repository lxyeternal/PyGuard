      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads to be executed on the system. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors and hides execution failures, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns such as obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation, all of which are hallmark indicators of malware."
