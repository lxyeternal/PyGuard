      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically fetches Python code from a remote URL ('https://sharetext.me/raw/gf8pcwkix5') and immediately executes it using exec(). This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted external source without any validation or user consent. The code also attempts to install the 'requests' package automatically if it is not present, which facilitates the network request. The absence of any legitimate user interaction, validation, or sandboxing before executing the fetched code, combined with the direct use of exec on remote content, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential for further malicious actions. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."
