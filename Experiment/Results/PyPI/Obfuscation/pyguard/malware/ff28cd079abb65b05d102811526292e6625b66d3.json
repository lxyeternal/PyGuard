      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides an install method to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload. This decrypted payload is then executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of exec on decrypted data, and the execution triggered automatically during installation without user consent or interaction strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also requires 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup dependencies, which are commonly used in malware for network communication and encryption. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily execute hidden malicious payloads on Windows systems during package installation, constituting a critical security risk."
