      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands, hidden window execution, and subprocess spawning are strong indicators of malicious intent, commonly observed in malware for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or persistence. The rest of the code invoking setup() with a suspicious package name and version appears to be a decoy or an attempt to disguise the malicious payload within a package installation script, a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious setup usage aligns with multiple critical risk indicators of malware."
