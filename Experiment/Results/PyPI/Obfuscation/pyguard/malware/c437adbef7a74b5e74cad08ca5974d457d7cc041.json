      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It downloads multiple zip files from a suspicious, non-official domain (https://frvezdffvv.pythonanywhere.com), extracts them without user consent, and deletes the zip files immediately after extraction. This sequence is typical of malware staging and payload delivery. Furthermore, the code fetches additional data from the same suspicious domain, decodes it from base64, and executes it dynamically using exec(), which is a classic technique for remote code execution and obfuscation. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user interaction or notification, and execution of arbitrary remote code during package setup strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malware installation vector. These behaviors align with critical risk patterns such as remote code execution from untrusted sources, automated download and execution of payloads, and obfuscation through base64 decoding and exec. Therefore, this code is malicious."
