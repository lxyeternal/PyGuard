      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a function that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (49.233.121.53) on port 54. The function decodes the IP and port from base64, creates a socket connection, duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input/output/error, and then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This behavior is a classic reverse shell payload, allowing an attacker to remotely execute commands on the victim machine. The code runs this payload automatically during package installation without user consent or notification, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of obfuscated variable and function names, base64 encoding to hide the IP and port, and execution of a shell during install time further confirm malicious intent."
