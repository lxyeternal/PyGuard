      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a function that performs malicious actions. Specifically, during installation, it fetches data from a suspicious, hardcoded URL ('https://minagolosinastorpedolocutormarcar.com/golosinapastortorpedopularie.html') without user consent. It then creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 8080 and redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket. Finally, it spawns a new interactive shell (/bin/sh) connected to this socket, effectively creating a reverse shell back to the attacker-controlled server. This behavior enables remote code execution and unauthorized control over the victim's system. The obfuscated function and variable names, the execution of network connections during package installation, and the spawning of a shell over a network socket are all strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setuptools install script, and it poses a critical security risk."
