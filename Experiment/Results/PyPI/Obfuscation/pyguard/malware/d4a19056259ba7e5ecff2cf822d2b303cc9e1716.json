      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to execute stealthily without user awareness. The directory existence check for 'tahg' before launching the process suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly seen in malware for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The obfuscation, stealth execution, and context strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
