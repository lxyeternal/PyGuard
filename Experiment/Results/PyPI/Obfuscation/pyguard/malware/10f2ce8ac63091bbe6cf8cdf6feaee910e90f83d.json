      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide its execution window, indicating stealth behavior. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently in the background is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly used for downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but does not mitigate or justify the hidden PowerShell execution. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
