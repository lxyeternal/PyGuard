      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the Python package installation process (setup script) to execute code during 'build', 'egg_info', 'bdist_wheel', and 'install' commands on Windows platforms. It attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package silently if missing, then writes obfuscated JavaScript code and a manifest.json file into a hidden directory under the user's APPDATA path. This JavaScript code runs in the background of a Chrome extension and repeatedly replaces clipboard contents with hardcoded cryptocurrency addresses, a classic clipboard hijacking technique to steal cryptocurrency transactions. The script then enumerates common user and system shortcut locations (Start Menu, Taskbar pinned items, Desktop) and modifies shortcuts to popular browsers (chrome.exe, msedge.exe, brave.exe, launcher.exe) to load the malicious extension on browser startup, ensuring persistence and stealthy execution. The use of obfuscated JavaScript, writing to system/user directories without user consent, modifying shortcuts to inject malicious extensions, and clipboard hijacking are all hallmark malicious behaviors. The code runs automatically during package installation without user interaction or notification, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to hijack clipboard data to steal cryptocurrency and maintain persistence on the victim's system."
