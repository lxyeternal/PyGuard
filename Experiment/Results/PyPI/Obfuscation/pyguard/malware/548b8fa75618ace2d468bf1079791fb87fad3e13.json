      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The obfuscation of the command string and the suppression of errors via try/except further indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity. Additionally, the setup call with a suspicious package name ('pqmkitovwua91fff') and the lack of legitimate user interaction or notification before executing the hidden PowerShell command strongly suggest malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attacks or malware that execute arbitrary code during package installation or setup, often to download or run further payloads without user consent."
