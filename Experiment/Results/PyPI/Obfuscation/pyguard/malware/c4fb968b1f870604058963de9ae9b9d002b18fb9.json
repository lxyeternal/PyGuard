      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell command is run with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' creation flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique in malware. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command and the hidden execution strongly indicate malicious intent, as this pattern is a well-known method for executing obfuscated payloads or commands without user awareness. Additionally, the code is embedded in a try-except block that suppresses all errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection or analysis. The subsequent call to setup() with a suspicious package name and no legitimate user interaction or notification suggests this code is designed to execute malicious payloads during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
