      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded and Fernet-encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is immediately executed using exec(). Executing decrypted code during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted code that is dynamically decrypted and executed without user consent or interaction strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a high-risk indicator of remote code execution and payload delivery during package installation, which can lead to system compromise."
