      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a Python package setup script that hooks into the installation process via setuptools. Specifically, it overrides the 'install' command to run a function 'iirisfunc' immediately after installation. This function collects all environment variables (os.environ), converts them to a string, encodes this string in base64, and then sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eow8fqyd1emg87l.m.pipedream.net/). This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, combined with the immediate network transmission during package installation, is a classic hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. The package name and description mention 'Dependency Confusion attack,' which aligns with the intent to exploit package installation workflows for malicious purposes. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthily collecting and leaking environment information during package installation."
