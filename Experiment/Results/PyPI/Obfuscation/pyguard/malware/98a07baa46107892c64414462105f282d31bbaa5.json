      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealthy execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads to be executed on the victim system. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
