      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a hardcoded PowerShell reverse shell command. Specifically, during installation, it runs a PowerShell command that creates a TCP client connecting to the IP address 81.68.184.99 on port 6784, establishing a remote shell session. This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, execution of a shell command during package installation, and the presence of a reverse shell payload are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise."
