      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the installation process to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it imports discord, socket, aiohttp, and asyncio modules and asynchronously sends the host's hostname and IP address to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of obfuscated class and method names, the hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URL, and the execution of network communication during install time with no legitimate purpose strongly indicate malicious intent."
