      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and immediately executed via exec(), which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The code executes different payloads depending on the operating system, both of which perform suspicious actions such as writing executable files to temporary directories, spawning hidden processes, and making network requests to hardcoded, suspicious URLs. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands on Windows and complex shell commands on non-Windows systems further confirms attempts to evade detection and execute unauthorized code. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script, which means it executes automatically during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The decoded payloads include network communication, environment reconnaissance, file system manipulation, and execution of downloaded or embedded malicious code. These behaviors align with credential theft, data exfiltration, remote code execution, and persistence mechanisms typical of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
