      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 decoding to dynamically decode and execute obfuscated Python code at install time via exec. The decoded payload creates a socket connection to a hardcoded external domain ('sidhug-35019.portmap.io') on port 35019 and attempts to receive and execute further code in a loop. This behavior is a classic hallmark of remote code execution and backdoor functionality. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic execution (exec), and network communication to an external server without user interaction or consent strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which means the malicious payload executes automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. These factors combined confirm that the code contains malicious behavior."
