      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during installation, downloads a Python script named 'ratfinal.py' from a hardcoded external URL hosted on Discord's CDN. It writes this script to the current working directory and immediately executes it using subprocess with the current Python interpreter. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is fetched from an untrusted remote source and executed without user consent or validation. The obfuscated class and method names, combined with the download and execution of a remote script during package installation, strongly indicate malicious intent. Such code can lead to remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise. There is no legitimate reason for a package installation script to perform these actions, and this pattern is exclusively associated with malware."
