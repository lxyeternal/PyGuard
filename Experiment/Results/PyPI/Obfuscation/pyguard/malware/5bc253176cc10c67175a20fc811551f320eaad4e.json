      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess to run encoded PowerShell commands in hidden mode is a hallmark of malware, often used for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading and executing further payloads. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. There is no user interaction or notification, and the obfuscation combined with hidden execution strongly indicates malicious behavior."
