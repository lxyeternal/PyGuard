      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using hex-encoded strings, dynamic eval and compile calls, and base64 decoding combined with zlib decompression. It dynamically imports critical functions like eval, compile, and exec, then decodes and decompresses a large base64-encoded payload which is immediately executed. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious code used to hide the true payload and evade static detection. The code also manipulates decoded data with custom decoding functions and executes it without any user interaction or validation. The obfuscation and immediate execution of decoded and decompressed data strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads. Such behavior is typical of malware that delivers and runs secondary payloads, often for credential theft, remote code execution, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
