      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (WindowStyle Hidden, CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this process, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden process without user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The setup call itself appears benign but is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which may be used to hide failures in malicious payload execution. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a critical risk indicator of malware behavior."
