      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools with obfuscated class and method names, which is a common evasion technique. Inside the custom install class, it calls a subprocess method with obfuscated name, passing a command to run a Python module ('poc_nvk.my_module') using the current Python interpreter. This means that during package installation, arbitrary code execution is triggered without user interaction or consent. The obfuscation of names and the execution of a subprocess during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed automatically on install. This behavior is a hallmark of malicious packages that execute unauthorized code during installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, system compromise, or further payload delivery. The lack of any legitimate user interaction, the obfuscated naming, and the execution of an external module during install time are all strong indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the hostname, operating system name, and IP address, then automatically sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://eowdq5q6u6qkhxe.m.pipedream.net/poc) without any user interaction or consent. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The automatic exfiltration of host environment data to an attacker-controlled endpoint is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for reconnaissance or staging further attacks. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification associated with this data collection and transmission, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent."
