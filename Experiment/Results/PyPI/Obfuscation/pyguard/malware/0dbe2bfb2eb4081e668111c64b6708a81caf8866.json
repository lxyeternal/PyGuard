      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name, which may be an attempt to disguise or deliver the payload during package installation. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as stealthy code execution, obfuscation, and potential supply chain attack vectors. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
