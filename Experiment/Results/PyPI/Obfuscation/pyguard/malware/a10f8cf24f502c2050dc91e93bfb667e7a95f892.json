      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the hostname, current user, current working directory, and a suspicious package name, then encodes this information in base64. It then constructs obfuscated hex-encoded strings appended with a suspicious domain '.sub.deliverycontent.online' and performs multiple 'ping' commands to these constructed hostnames, likely as a covert channel or beaconing mechanism. Subsequently, it sends HTTP requests (GET and POST) to hardcoded suspicious external domains 'www.deliverycontent.online' and '.sub.deliverycontent.online', transmitting the encoded system information in the URL query parameters or POST data. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as hex encoding and base64 encoding to hide the data being exfiltrated. There is no user interaction or legitimate business logic, and the code attempts to silently collect and exfiltrate environment and user information to attacker-controlled servers. These behaviors are classic indicators of malicious activity, including information stealing and command-and-control communication. Therefore, this code is malicious."
