      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects Discord tokens from various local storage paths, decrypts browser-stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI, and gathers billing and friend information from Discord APIs using stolen tokens. The code exfiltrates this sensitive information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. It also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files containing keywords related to accounts, passwords, and secrets, uploads them to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. The code uses threading to perform these actions stealthily and suppresses errors to evade detection. It installs required dependencies automatically if missing. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook, automated extraction and decryption of sensitive credentials, exfiltration of data over the network, and execution of these actions during package setup indicate malicious intent. This code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as environment discovery, credential theft, data exfiltration, and stealthy execution, consistent with known malware behavior."
