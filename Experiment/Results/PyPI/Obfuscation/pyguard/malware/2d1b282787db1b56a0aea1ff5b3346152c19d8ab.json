      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and immediately executed via exec(), a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The code conditionally executes different payloads depending on the operating system, with the Windows branch decoding and running a heavily obfuscated PowerShell command, which is a known method for stealthy execution and potential privilege escalation or payload delivery. The non-Windows branch decodes and executes a large base64-encoded Python script that performs extensive environment reconnaissance, collects sensitive user and system information, and sends it to remote servers. The code imports modules commonly used in malware (e.g., base64, os, sys), performs network communication to suspicious or attacker-controlled endpoints, and executes shell commands without user interaction or consent. It also runs automatically during package installation (setup script), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, environment data collection, network exfiltration, and stealthy process spawning confirms that this code is malicious."
