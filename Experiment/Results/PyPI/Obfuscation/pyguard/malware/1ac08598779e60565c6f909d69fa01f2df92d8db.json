      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://kekwltd.ru/kekwltd.exe) and saves it to a path inside the user's APPDATA directory under a Microsoft subfolder, which is a common technique to hide malicious payloads. Immediately after downloading, it executes the downloaded file using subprocess.call with the 'start' command, which launches the executable without user interaction or consent. The variable names are obfuscated and meaningless, indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic surrounding the download and execution. This pattern—downloading a remote executable and running it silently from a hidden or user-specific directory—is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
