      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating an attempt to hide execution from the user. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a persistence or staging check. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands, hidden execution, and subprocess spawning are strong indicators of malicious intent, commonly observed in malware for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. The subsequent call to setup() appears benign but is likely a decoy or part of a supply chain attack vector to disguise the malicious behavior during package installation. Overall, the presence of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered automatically without user interaction classifies this code as malicious."
