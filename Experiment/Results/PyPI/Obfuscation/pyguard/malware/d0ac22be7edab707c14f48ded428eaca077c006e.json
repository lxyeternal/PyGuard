      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag suppresses any visible window, which is a stealth technique. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is highly suspicious and typical of malware that executes hidden payloads or downloads further malicious components. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns such as obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of installation hooks for unauthorized code execution."
