      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the presence of such an encoded PowerShell command executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is wrapped in try/except blocks that suppress any errors, which is a common evasion technique. The setup() call with a suspicious, random-looking package name and version is likely a decoy or a method to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on file system state, and suppression of errors strongly indicates malicious behavior consistent with malware techniques such as stealthy payload execution, persistence, or further payload download/execution."
