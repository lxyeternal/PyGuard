      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the platform is macOS ('darwin'), it decodes a base64-encoded shell command ('ioreg -k IOPlatformUUID'), executes it to retrieve the machine's platform UUID, and extracts a substring from the output. It then checks if this UUID matches one of two hardcoded UUIDs. If there is a match, it reads a PDF file ('static/simple_linear_regression.pdf'), extracts a large slice of its binary content starting at offset 273861, writes this slice to a file named 'gomod' in a temporary directory under '/tmp/go-build427292401/exe/', sets executable permissions on this file, and then executes it as a subprocess with output suppressed. This behavior is triggered automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 decoding of commands, conditional execution based on system UUID, writing and executing a binary extracted from a PDF file in a temporary directory, and silent subprocess execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks where malicious payloads are staged and executed during package installation, targeting specific machines by UUID. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
