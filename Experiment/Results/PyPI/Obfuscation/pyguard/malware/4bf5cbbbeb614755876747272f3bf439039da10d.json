      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to run an encoded PowerShell command in hidden mode without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates this code is malicious."
