      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then writes a temporary file containing code that fetches and executes remote code from a suspicious URL ('https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/7bupb/raw'). This behavior—downloading and executing code from an external, non-official source without user consent—is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and potential further compromise. Additionally, this execution occurs during the package setup phase, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and the immediate execution of decoded code further confirm malicious intent. The rest of the setup script uses suspiciously obfuscated variable names and package metadata that do not correspond to legitimate software, reinforcing the conclusion that this is malicious code."

The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling and system execution, then writes a script that fetches and executes code from a suspicious external URL (https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/7bupb/raw). This behavior is typical of malware that dynamically downloads and runs remote code without user consent. Additionally, the code uses obfuscated and randomized class and function names, imports system modules for shell command execution, and includes functions to manipulate the console and execute arbitrary shell commands. The initial base64 decoding and execution pattern, combined with network retrieval of code and execution, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, obfuscation, and dynamic payload delivery. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code is designed to run stealthily, which further confirms its malicious nature."
