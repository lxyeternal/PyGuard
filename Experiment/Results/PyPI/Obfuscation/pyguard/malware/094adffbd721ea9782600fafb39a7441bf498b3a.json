      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes Python code into it that downloads and executes code from a hardcoded external IP address (http://54.237.36.60/inject/QrvxFGKvsSJ5E5bx) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system shell command that runs the Python executable in windowed mode. This pattern of dynamically fetching and executing remote code without user consent or validation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temporary file, and immediate execution of remote code are classic malware techniques for payload delivery and evasion. The hardcoded IP address and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or business logic further confirm the malicious intent."
