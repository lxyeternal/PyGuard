      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is designed to run silently (WindowStyle Hidden) without user interaction or notification. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in a hidden window, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The subprocess call uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to suppress any console window, further indicating stealthy execution. The rest of the code calls setuptools.setup with a suspiciously random package name, which may be an attempt to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, the pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden process, without user consent or transparency, is a hallmark of malware, such as a downloader, backdoor, or persistence mechanism."
