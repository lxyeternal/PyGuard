      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It extensively uses obfuscation techniques such as base32 and base16 encoding combined with marshal serialization and zlib compression to hide the actual code payloads. The code dynamically decodes and executes these obfuscated payloads using exec, which is a high-risk pattern commonly used in malware to evade detection and analysis. The presence of the 'telethon' library and functions handling Telegram events suggests it may be used for remote command and control or data exfiltration via Telegram. The code also includes asynchronous functions that respond to specific commands (e.g., 'webshare') and perform further obfuscated code execution and file operations, including sending files and deleting messages, which can be used to hide malicious activity. The overall structure, obfuscation, and dynamic execution of hidden payloads, combined with network communication and file manipulation without user consent, confirm that this code contains malicious behavior."
