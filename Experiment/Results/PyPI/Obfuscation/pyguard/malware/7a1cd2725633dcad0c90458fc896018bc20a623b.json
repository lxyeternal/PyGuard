      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded, encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during package installation strongly indicate that the code is designed to run hidden malicious code on the victim's system during package installation. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code attempts to execute arbitrary code dynamically, which is a critical risk indicator for malware."
