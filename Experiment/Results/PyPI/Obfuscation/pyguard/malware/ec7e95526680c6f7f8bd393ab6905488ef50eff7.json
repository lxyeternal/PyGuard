      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it executes the shell command 'whoami' via subprocess to retrieve the current system username. It then sends this username along with the package name to a hardcoded external URL ('https://vigneshsb.me/test.php') via an HTTP POST request without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated collection and exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The obfuscated class and method names, the use of subprocess to execute shell commands, and the silent network communication to an external server during install time strongly indicate malicious intent."
