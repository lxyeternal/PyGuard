      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command, which is executed silently (WindowStyle Hidden) and without user interaction or notification. The presence of a check for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process suggests conditional execution, a common evasion technique. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with encoded commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is often used to execute arbitrary or harmful payloads, download further malware, or perform system compromise stealthily. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The obfuscation, lack of transparency, and stealth execution align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, hidden process execution, and potential payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
