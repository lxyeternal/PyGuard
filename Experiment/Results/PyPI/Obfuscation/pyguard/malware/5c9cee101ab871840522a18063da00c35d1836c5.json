      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to run stealthily without user notification. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of distutils.setup with a suspicious package name 'sbbrtcgar7ouozwj' and the silent try/except blocks further suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity during package installation. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution, stealthy process spawning, and potential supply chain attack vectors. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
