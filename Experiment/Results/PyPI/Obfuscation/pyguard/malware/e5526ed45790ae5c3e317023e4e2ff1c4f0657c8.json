      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden shell process, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior aimed at stealthy execution. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be an evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspicious package metadata, but the key malicious indicator is the obfuscated PowerShell command execution during module import or setup. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks or payload delivery during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
