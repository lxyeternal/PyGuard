      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating malicious PowerShell payloads. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables stealthy execution of potentially harmful commands without user consent or interaction. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the code is a benign-looking setup call, likely to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a critical indicator of malicious intent."
