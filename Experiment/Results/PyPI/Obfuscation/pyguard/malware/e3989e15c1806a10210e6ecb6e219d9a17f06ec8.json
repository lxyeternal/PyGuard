      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and environment information without user consent, including the contents of sensitive files such as /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts, environment variables, process list, directory listings (including user home directory), and a specific file logger.py. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP request to a suspicious external URL (https://pypi.org/reqs?d=) with a forged Host header ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). The obfuscated variable and function names, combined with the silent try/except blocks suppressing errors, indicate an attempt to evade detection. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including unauthorized data collection, obfuscation via base64 encoding, and exfiltration of sensitive system information to an external server without user interaction or consent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code is designed to stealthily gather and transmit potentially sensitive data, which is a hallmark of information-stealing malware."
