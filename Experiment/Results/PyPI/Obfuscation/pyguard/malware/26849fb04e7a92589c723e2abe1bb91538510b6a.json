      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 decoding combined with marshal.loads to dynamically load and execute obfuscated bytecode via exec. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual payload and executes it without any user interaction or validation. The use of marshal and base64 to conceal code is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to evade detection. Given the extensive knowledge points, such direct execution of decoded and deserialized code is almost exclusively observed in malware samples. The code likely performs unauthorized actions such as environment reconnaissance, data exfiltration, or remote code execution. The absence of any benign context or legitimate user interaction further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."
