      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes code during package installation. Specifically, it attempts to send the host's hostname and IP address to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the hardcoded external webhook URL, and the silent transmission of environment data during install time strongly indicate malicious intent. Such behavior is not typical or legitimate for standard Python packages and is consistent with malware patterns that collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information covertly."
