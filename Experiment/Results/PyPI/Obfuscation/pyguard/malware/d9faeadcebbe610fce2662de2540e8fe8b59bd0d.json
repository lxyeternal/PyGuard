      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (via os.getcwd()), and the username of the current user (via getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain 'cr7xkq5x92kuah2bah2wpjif76dy1n.burpcollaborator.net'. This behavior is a classic example of silent data exfiltration during package installation without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code executes automatically during installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for a package installer to collect and transmit such environment data to an unknown external server. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential or environment data theft and exfiltration."
