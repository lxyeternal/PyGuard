      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window style), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell with encoded commands, combined with the suppression of errors via try/except and the lack of any user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the setup call with a suspicious package name ('unj1pritgwbn2tit') and the absence of legitimate business logic further support the conclusion that this code is designed for malicious purposes, likely as part of a supply chain attack or malware installation routine."
