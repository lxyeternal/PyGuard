      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The command is run with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to download, execute, or stage further payloads without user knowledge. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscated command execution, stealthy process spawning, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
