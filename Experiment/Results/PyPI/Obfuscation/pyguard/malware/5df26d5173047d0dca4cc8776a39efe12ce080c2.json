      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a base64-encoded shell command. This command initiates a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (13.93.28.37) on port 8888 by spawning a bash shell connected to a socket. The base64 encoding is used to obfuscate the command, which is then decoded and executed via 'os.system'. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious code, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, enabling an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The code executes without user interaction or consent, uses obfuscation, and contacts a hardcoded external IP, all of which are strong indicators of malicious intent."
