      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and the execution of decrypted code during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. The setup script also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting the intent to execute hidden malicious code. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code is designed to run silently during installation, which is a critical risk indicator for malware."
