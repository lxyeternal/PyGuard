      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install class for a Python package setup that registers an atexit handler function. This handler function, executed automatically at the end of the installation process, performs several suspicious actions without user consent or notification: it creates/appends a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with the text 'proof bug by kotko'; it collects the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://api.ipify.org'; it retrieves the hostname via os.uname(); it obtains and URL-encodes the absolute path of the current script's directory; it then concatenates these pieces of information, encodes them in base64, and sends them via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with a constructed query parameter. The obfuscated variable names, the automatic execution during package installation, the silent collection of environment and system information, the base64 encoding of data before exfiltration, and the transmission of this data to an attacker-controlled server are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known supply chain attack techniques where code execution and data exfiltration occur during package installation, without user interaction or legitimate purpose."
