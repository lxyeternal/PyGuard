      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the hostname, current user, current working directory, and a hardcoded string, then encodes this information in base64. It then converts this encoded data into a hex-encoded format with additional randomization and sends it via multiple ICMP ping commands to a suspicious domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online'). Following this, it attempts multiple HTTP requests (GET and POST) to a hardcoded suspicious domain ('www.deliverycontent.online'), sending the encoded system information as part of the request parameters or body. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. There is no user interaction or legitimate business logic, and the behavior matches known patterns of malware performing host fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. The use of base64 encoding combined with hex encoding and network exfiltration, especially via ping commands and HTTP requests to suspicious domains, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
