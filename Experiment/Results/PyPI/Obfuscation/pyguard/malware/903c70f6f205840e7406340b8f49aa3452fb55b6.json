      "malicious_behavior": "The code performs a check for the existence of the directory 'C:/ProgramData/Updater'. If it does not exist, it silently executes a complex PowerShell command that downloads a ZIP archive from a suspicious external URL (https://transfer.sh/eyRyPT/Updater.zip) into the temporary directory, extracts it to 'C:/ProgramData', deletes the ZIP file, installs multiple Python dependencies via pip silently, and then runs a VBScript and a Python script from the extracted directory in hidden windows. This sequence involves downloading and executing potentially untrusted code without user consent or notification, running subprocesses with hidden windows, and installing dependencies automatically. The obfuscated function name and the use of subprocess.Popen with shell=True to run PowerShell commands that download and execute code from an external source are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk patterns such as remote code execution during package installation, silent payload delivery, and execution of hidden background processes, all hallmarks of malware or supply chain attacks."
