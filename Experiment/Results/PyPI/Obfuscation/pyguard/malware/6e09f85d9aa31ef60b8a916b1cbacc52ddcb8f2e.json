      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a function that creates a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (49.233.121.53) on port 54. The IP address and port are obfuscated using base64 encoding and decoded at runtime. The function then redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to the socket and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This behavior effectively gives remote command execution control to an attacker during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated variable and function names, base64 decoding, network connection to a suspicious hardcoded IP, and spawning a shell in the install hook are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This is a classic reverse shell backdoor embedded in a Python package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector."
