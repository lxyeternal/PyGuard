      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated variable names, the use of encrypted code execution during package installation, and the conditional execution only on Windows further indicate an attempt to evade detection and target specific environments. The setup call installs this malicious install command hook, ensuring the payload runs automatically when the package is installed. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a standard setuptools setup script, and the presence of network-related imports (requests) and cryptographic decryption (fernet) combined with exec() strongly suggests the code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads during installation."
