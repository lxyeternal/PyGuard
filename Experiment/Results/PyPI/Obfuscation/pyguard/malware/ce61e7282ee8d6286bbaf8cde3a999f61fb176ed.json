      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a setup script that hooks into the installation/build process on Windows platforms to silently install a Python package dependency (pypiwin32) if missing, then creates a hidden Chrome extension in the user's APPDATA directory. It writes obfuscated JavaScript code into background.js and a manifest.json file to enable clipboard manipulation. The script then enumerates common user and system shortcut locations (Start Menu, Taskbar, Desktop) and modifies shortcuts to Chrome, Edge, Brave, or launcher executables to load the malicious extension on browser startup. This behavior is characteristic of malware that hijacks browser shortcuts to inject malicious extensions without user consent, potentially to intercept or replace clipboard data (e.g., cryptocurrency addresses). The obfuscated JavaScript code repeatedly runs a function that manipulates clipboard content by replacing certain cryptocurrency address patterns with attacker-controlled addresses, a known clipboard hijacking technique used to steal cryptocurrency transactions. The use of environment variables to write files in user and system directories, the silent installation of dependencies, obfuscated code, and modification of user shortcuts to load malicious extensions during install time are all strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and credential theft malware."
