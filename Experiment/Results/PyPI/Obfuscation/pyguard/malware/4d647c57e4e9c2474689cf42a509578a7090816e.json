      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains obfuscated instructions that could download, execute, or perform other malicious actions without user consent or notification. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
