      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary file named 'node' from a suspicious external URL (https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node) and writes it to the /tmp directory without any user consent or validation. It then sets executable permissions on this file and executes it immediately. This behavior is a classic indicator of malicious activity, as it fetches and runs potentially untrusted code from a remote source. The function name is obfuscated, and the code is executed automatically during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user interaction, or validation, combined with the direct execution of a downloaded binary in a temporary directory, strongly indicates malicious intent."
