      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and WindowStyle Hidden suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a hallmark of malicious code. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, which is typical in malware to avoid crashing or revealing its presence. The setup call with a suspicious package name and unrelated classifiers appears to be a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate that the code is malicious, designed to execute hidden PowerShell commands potentially for payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation."
