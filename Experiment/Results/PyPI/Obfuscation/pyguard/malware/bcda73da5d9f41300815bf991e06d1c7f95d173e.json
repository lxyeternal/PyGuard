      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses the 'browser_cookie3' library to extract '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from multiple browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera) specifically for the domain 'roblox.com'. It then sends these cookies via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an attacker-controlled external endpoint. The function and variable names are obfuscated, and the code runs these extraction and exfiltration functions concurrently in separate threads without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of credential theft and data exfiltration malware, as it silently collects sensitive authentication cookies and sends them to a remote server for potential misuse, such as account hijacking. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, obfuscated names, automated background execution, and direct exfiltration of sensitive browser cookies are strong indicators of malicious intent."
