      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64 decoding combined with exec to execute hidden code dynamically, which is a classic obfuscation and payload delivery technique. It checks for the existence of a suspicious directory 'C:/ProgramData/Updater' and if absent, it silently downloads a ZIP archive from an untrusted external URL (https://transfer.sh/WULklK/Updater.zip) using PowerShell with suppressed output and error preferences, extracts it to a system directory, removes the archive, and then launches a hidden process to install numerous Python packages and execute a script (server.pyw) from the extracted files. This sequence is typical of multi-stage malware that downloads and executes secondary payloads without user consent or notification. The use of PowerShell in hidden mode, obfuscated variable names, and execution during package setup further confirm this is a supply chain attack or installer trojan. The behavior includes stealthy installation, dependency installation, and execution of potentially untrusted code, all without user interaction, which is highly suspicious and consistent with malware patterns."
