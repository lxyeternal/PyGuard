      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class that executes during package installation. It runs multiple shell commands to collect detailed system information, including OS details ('uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, network configuration ('ifconfig' or 'ipconfig'), username ('whoami'), and hostname. It also fetches the public IP address by making an HTTP GET request to 'http://ifconfig.me'. All this collected sensitive environment and user information is then formatted into a JSON payload and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of sensitive system and user identity data without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, execution of shell commands during install, and network exfiltration to a hardcoded external endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission during package installation."
