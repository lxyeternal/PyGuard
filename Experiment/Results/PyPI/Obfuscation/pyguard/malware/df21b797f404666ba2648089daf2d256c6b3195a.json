      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell scripts. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to avoid user detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a persistence or staging check. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly observed in malware for payload delivery, privilege escalation, or further compromise. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern aligns with supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent or interaction."
