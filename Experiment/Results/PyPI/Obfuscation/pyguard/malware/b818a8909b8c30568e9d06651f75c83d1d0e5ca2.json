      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is a setup.py script that hooks into the setuptools install and develop commands to execute a function GWkViygaMhonDeaYzKKQevxcOmqgXLPC() during package installation. This function only runs on Windows (os.name == 'nt') and performs the following suspicious actions: it fetches a remote URL by first querying 'https://stub.syntheticcc.repl.co' and parsing the response to extract a URL starting with 'https://cdn-'. It then constructs a path to the Windows Startup folder inside the user's APPDATA directory and writes the content downloaded from the extracted URL to a file named 'Update.exe' in that Startup folder. Finally, it attempts to execute this 'Update.exe' file using a shell command. This sequence is a classic malware pattern: downloading an executable from a remote, attacker-controlled server, placing it in a persistence location (Startup folder), and executing it silently during package installation without user consent or notification. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, suppresses exceptions silently, and performs network communication combined with file writing and execution in a setup/install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script, and the use of dynamic URL retrieval and execution of a downloaded binary strongly indicates malicious intent."
