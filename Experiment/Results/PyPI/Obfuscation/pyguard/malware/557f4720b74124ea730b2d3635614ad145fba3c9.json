      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It uses dynamic string construction and imports modules conditionally based on platform and command-line arguments. The code attempts to import 'pip' and run pip commands programmatically, which is unusual in setup scripts. It also tries to import 'win32com' and uses COM Dispatch objects to create and save shortcuts, indicating Windows-specific persistence or execution mechanisms. The code performs extensive file system operations, including creating directories and writing files to user or system paths derived from environment variables. It walks through directories and processes files with specific extensions, creating shortcuts pointing to these files, which is a common technique for persistence or spreading. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, combined with environment variable usage to locate system folders, file writing, and shortcut creation, strongly indicate malicious behavior. The code is designed to execute during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscation, environment discovery, file system manipulation, and use of Windows COM interfaces for persistence."
