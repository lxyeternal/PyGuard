      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a shell command that is executed automatically during the package installation process. Specifically, the function 'notmalfunc' decodes the base64 string 'dHlwZSBudWwgPiBwcnVlYmExMS50eHQKZGly' which translates to the shell command 'type nul > prueba11.txt\\dir' (on Windows, 'type nul > filename' creates an empty file). This command is executed via os.system() in the 'AfterInstall' class's run method, which is hooked into setuptools' install command. Executing shell commands during installation without user interaction or notification is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command and the automatic execution during install strongly indicate malicious intent. Although the command itself creates a file named 'prueba11.txt' and then runs 'dir', which may seem benign, the obfuscation and execution in install hooks are typical of malware attempting to run hidden or preparatory commands. This pattern aligns with known malicious behaviors involving obfuscated shell command execution during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks."
