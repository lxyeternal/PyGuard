      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) without any user consent or validation, writes it to the local filesystem as 'pics.exe', and then immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen. This sequence of automated download and execution of a remote binary is a classic hallmark of malware propagation and payload delivery. The obfuscated function and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate user interaction, notification, or validation before the file is executed, which strongly suggests malicious intent. The use of requests to fetch an executable and subprocess to run it without any checks or safeguards is a critical risk indicator of malware behavior."
