      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to run stealthily without user awareness. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains further malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing additional payloads, given the use of encoded commands and hidden execution. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of try-except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection or interruption. Overall, these behaviors align strongly with known malware patterns involving obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of installation scripts for malicious payload delivery."
