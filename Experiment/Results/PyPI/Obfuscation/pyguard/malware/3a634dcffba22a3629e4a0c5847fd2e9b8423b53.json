      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a classic technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspicious package metadata, but the key malicious indicator is the obfuscated PowerShell execution during import or setup. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks or malicious package installers that execute hidden payloads during installation or import. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
