      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then runs this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or to avoid repeated execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains further malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing payloads, or performing system reconnaissance or data exfiltration. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The use of try-except blocks to silently ignore errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution continuity. These behaviors align strongly with known malware patterns, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and abuse of installation hooks for malicious payload delivery."
