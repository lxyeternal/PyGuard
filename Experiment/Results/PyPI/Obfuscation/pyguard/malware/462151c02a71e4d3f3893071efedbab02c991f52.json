      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, spawning PowerShell in hidden mode, and execution during the setup process (package installation) are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes code during package installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try/except block, likely to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the obfuscation and hidden execution strongly suggest this code is designed to execute unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system."
