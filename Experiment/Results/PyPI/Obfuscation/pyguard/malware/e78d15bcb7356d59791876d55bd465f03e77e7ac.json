      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the install process in setuptools. During installation, it constructs a URL in an obfuscated manner by concatenating single-character variables to form a suspicious URL pointing to a 'discordapp.com' CDN path with specific IDs and file paths. It then uses the 'requests' library to perform an HTTP GET request to download a Python script named 'qrcodegen.py' from this remote URL. The script is saved locally and immediately executed via subprocess with the current Python interpreter. This behavior—downloading and executing remote code during package installation without user consent or validation—is a classic hallmark of a supply chain attack and remote code execution malware. The obfuscation of variable names and URL components further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a standard setup script, and it poses a critical security risk by allowing arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation."
