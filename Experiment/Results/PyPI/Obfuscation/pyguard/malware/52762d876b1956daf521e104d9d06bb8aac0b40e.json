      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using encoded strings, dynamic eval and compile calls, and base64 decoding combined with zlib decompression. It dynamically reconstructs and executes code at runtime, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code imports modules and functions in an obfuscated manner, decodes and decompresses a large base64-encoded payload, and executes it without any user interaction or validation. This pattern is typical of malware that hides its payload to evade detection and analysis. The use of eval on dynamically decoded and decompressed data, combined with obfuscated variable and function names, strongly suggests that the code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads. Such behavior is consistent with information stealing, remote code execution, or other unauthorized actions. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
