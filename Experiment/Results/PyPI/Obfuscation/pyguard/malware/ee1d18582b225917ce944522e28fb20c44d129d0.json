      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this collected information as a dictionary in an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL 'https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun'. This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation without user consent or notification. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain for data exfiltration combined with execution during the install phase is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. There is no legitimate reason for a package installation script to silently collect and transmit such environment data to an unknown external server. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
