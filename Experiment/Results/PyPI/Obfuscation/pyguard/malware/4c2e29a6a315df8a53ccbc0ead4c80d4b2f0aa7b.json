      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The setup call itself appears benign, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution alongside it strongly suggests the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful payloads without user consent. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and abuse of installation hooks."
