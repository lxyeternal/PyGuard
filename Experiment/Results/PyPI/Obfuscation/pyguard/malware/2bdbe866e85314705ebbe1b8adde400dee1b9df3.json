      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads to be executed silently. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly seen in malware that uses supply chain attacks or post-install scripts to execute unauthorized code. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but does not mitigate the malicious subprocess execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
