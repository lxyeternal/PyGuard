      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context (distutils.core.setup) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. These characteristics align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
