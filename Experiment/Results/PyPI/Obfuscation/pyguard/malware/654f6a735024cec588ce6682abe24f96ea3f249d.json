      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and WindowStyle Hidden suppresses any visible window, which is a stealth technique. This pattern—executing an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in try/except, likely to mask errors and avoid detection. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script, and no user interaction or notification is present. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
