      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes into it a Python command that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/bjhtk/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This is a classic remote code execution pattern. Then, it attempts to execute this temporary file using a system call that runs the Python interpreter in windowed mode (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe') with the temporary file as argument. This behavior occurs during the setup process of a Python package, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The code performs no user interaction or validation before downloading and executing arbitrary code from an untrusted external source, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscated variable names and the use of exec on remotely fetched code further confirm the malicious nature. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a high-risk indicator of remote code execution and payload delivery."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes Python code into it that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/yg9e5/raw) without any validation or user consent. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system call that runs the Python interpreter in a likely hidden or background mode (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe' to suppress console windows on Windows). This pattern of dynamically fetching and executing remote code, combined with obfuscated variable names and silent execution (try/except pass), is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code effectively enables remote code execution from an untrusted source, which is a classic hallmark of malware, including backdoors, trojans, or loaders. There is no legitimate user interaction, no integrity checks, and no transparency, making this code highly suspicious and malicious."
