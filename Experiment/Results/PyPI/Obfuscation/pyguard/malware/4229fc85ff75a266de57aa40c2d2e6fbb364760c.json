      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to run stealthily without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated or detected runs. The use of distutils.setup with a suspicious package name and version, combined with the hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during import or setup, is a classic pattern of supply chain or installation-time malware. The obfuscated PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or data exfiltration. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns including stealth execution, obfuscation, and potential remote code execution during package installation."
