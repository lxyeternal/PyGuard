      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a text file from a hardcoded external IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), parses it to find lines containing the current operating system name, and then attempts to download files named by those lines from the same external IP. It writes these files to the local filesystem without user consent, sets executable permissions on Unix-like systems, and executes them in the background. This behavior is a classic pattern of malware that stages and executes remote payloads dynamically. The obfuscated function and variable names, lack of any user interaction or notification, and the automatic execution of downloaded binaries from an untrusted source strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also hooks into HTTP method functions to call this malicious payload downloader on every request, further indicating stealthy and automatic execution. Such automated downloading and execution of remote code without validation or user consent is a hallmark of malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports from a module named 'frequest' which is a suspicious and non-standard module name, potentially a typo or a maliciously crafted package. The imported names are obfuscated and nonsensical (e.g., 'ObFRRpOqANJmYScYmeSXIusYjYzGqjsv'), which is a common obfuscation technique used in malware to hide intent and evade detection. Such obfuscated imports often indicate hidden or malicious functionality. Given the suspicious module name and obfuscated import identifiers, this code strongly suggests malicious intent, likely related to stealthy network communication, data exfiltration, or execution of unauthorized actions."
