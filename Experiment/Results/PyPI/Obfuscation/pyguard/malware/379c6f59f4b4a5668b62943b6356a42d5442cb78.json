      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a classic technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a rudimentary evasion or staging check. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with arbitrary package metadata, but this is wrapped in a try-except block and does not mitigate the suspicious subprocess call. The presence of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell execution during module setup strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware that executes payloads during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
