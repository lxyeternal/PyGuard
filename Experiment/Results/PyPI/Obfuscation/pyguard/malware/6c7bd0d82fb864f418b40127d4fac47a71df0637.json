      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware evasion technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated or unnecessary runs. This behavior is indicative of malicious intent, as it involves obfuscated code execution in a hidden process without user interaction or notification. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
