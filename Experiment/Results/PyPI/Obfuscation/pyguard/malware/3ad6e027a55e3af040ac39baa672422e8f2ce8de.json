      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior characterized by automated collection and exfiltration of files from the target system to an attacker-controlled Telegram bot. Specifically, it uses hardcoded Telegram bot tokens and chat IDs to send files and messages without user consent. The functions GlkrLvSsYBcuWoGoQuWodQwkhmFsmchq and ccwKXqYsTiilyzLQoyYpoVirpXfTlNeg recursively scan directories (including sensitive paths like '/storage/emulated/0' and '/sdcard/DCIM'), identify files with extensions such as .py, .php, .zip, and image files (.png, .jpg, .jpeg), and send them as documents or photos to the attacker's Telegram chat. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to evade detection. There is no user interaction or notification, and the data exfiltration is fully automated and stealthy. The use of hardcoded Telegram API endpoints and tokens for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code runs these exfiltration tasks concurrently in background threads, further indicating stealth and evasion techniques. Overall, this code is a data stealer that silently collects and sends potentially sensitive files from the victim device to an attacker-controlled Telegram account."
