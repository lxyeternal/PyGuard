      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques such as encoded strings with escape sequences, dynamic evaluation of code via eval and compile, and base64 decoding combined with further decoding and validation steps. The code dynamically imports critical modules like base64, compile, exec, and others through obfuscated means. It defines functions that decode and transform data, then executes the decoded payload dynamically. The final execution line decodes a large base64-encoded and obfuscated payload, processes it through multiple decoding layers, and executes it with eval. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware that hides its true intent and payload to evade detection. The absence of any user interaction, the use of eval on decoded data, and the presence of multi-layered obfuscation strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads, potentially for data exfiltration, remote code execution, or other harmful activities. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
