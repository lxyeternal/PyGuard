      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flags further hides the execution from the user. The encoded command string is not human-readable and is likely to contain malicious payload or instructions. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, which is typical in malware to avoid crashing or revealing its presence. The package name 'ovxm2gtppu0ncfk3' appears random and suspicious, consistent with obfuscation or evasion. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with stealthy payload execution, likely for persistence, payload delivery, or further compromise."
