      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes code during package installation without user interaction or consent. It imports the discord library and related modules to send data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code collects the local machine's hostname and IP address, then asynchronously sends this information to the attacker's Discord webhook. This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of obfuscated class and function names, hardcoded external webhook URL, and execution of network communication in the install hook without legitimate purpose or user notification strongly indicate malicious intent."
