      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a remote URL using a shell command (curl) without any validation or user consent, then immediately executes the downloaded file using os.start. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it automates retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from remote sources. The absence of any user interaction, validation, or security checks before executing the downloaded file aligns with typical malware behavior for payload delivery and execution. Such automated download-and-execute sequences are commonly used in malware propagation, remote code execution, and supply chain attacks."
