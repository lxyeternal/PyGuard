      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It programmatically extracts Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent, which is a direct breach of user privacy and security. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects extensive user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, and IP address. This sensitive data, including the stolen authentication cookie, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an attacker-controlled endpoint. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to evade detection and lacks any user interaction or notification, performing all actions silently in the background. The combination of automated credential theft, environment reconnaissance, and data exfiltration to a hardcoded external server without user consent is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
