      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden shell process, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to evade repeated detection or to target specific environments. The rest of the code attempts to run a setup function with a suspiciously random package name, which may be a decoy or part of a supply chain attack vector. The overall pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscated code execution during package installation or runtime, stealth execution of hidden shell commands, and potential payload delivery or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
