      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a shell command that is executed automatically during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). The decoded command uses 'curl' to silently download a file named 'strings.bat' into a temporary directory and then executes it. The URL in the command points to a suspicious external domain (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), which is a common vector for malware payload delivery. This pattern of obfuscation, automatic execution during install, and downloading/executing remote code without user consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of base64 to hide the command, execution via os.system during install, and the external network call to a non-official domain strongly indicate malicious intent."
