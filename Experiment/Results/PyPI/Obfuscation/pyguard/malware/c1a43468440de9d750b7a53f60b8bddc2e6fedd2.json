      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses a highly suspicious pattern of obfuscation and dynamic code execution. It imports base64 and lzma modules to decode and decompress a large base64-encoded payload, then immediately executes it using exec(compile(...)). This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload and executes it at runtime without user interaction or consent. The presence of this obfuscated payload in a setuptools setup script suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The package name 'n9b3v40kmziy6kpw' is random and suspicious, and the install_requires list includes modules commonly used in malware (e.g., browser_cookie3, requests, cryptography, httpx, pypiwin32, dhooks, pycryptodome), which are often leveraged for credential theft, data exfiltration, and persistence. The absence of any legitimate code or user interaction, combined with the immediate execution of decompressed and decoded data, confirms that this code contains malicious behavior."
