      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package supply chain attacks. The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated code without user consent or interaction during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during the install hook strongly indicate malicious intent."
