      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a subprocess.Popen call that launches a PowerShell process with the -WindowStyle Hidden flag and an encoded command passed via -EncodedCommand. This is a classic obfuscation and stealth technique used by malware to execute hidden payloads without user interaction or notification. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known method to evade detection and analysis. The subprocess is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, further hiding the execution window. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code attempts to run a setup() call from distutils.core with a suspicious package name 'peenr346fn0tmkrn' and a broad range of Python versions, which is typical of malicious packages trying to masquerade as legitimate. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process creation, lack of user consent, and suspicious package setup strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware installation routines."
