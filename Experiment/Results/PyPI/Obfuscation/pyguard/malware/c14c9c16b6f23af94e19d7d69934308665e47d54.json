      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools with obfuscated class and method names, which is a common evasion technique. Inside the custom install class, it overrides a method (likely the install method, but obfuscated) and calls subprocess with a similarly obfuscated method name, passing a command to run a Python module ('poc_nvk.my_module') using the current Python interpreter. Executing arbitrary code during package installation without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscation of names and the execution of a module during install strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized code on the user's system during package installation. This pattern aligns with known malicious behaviors where attackers hijack the installation process to run arbitrary code, often for payload delivery, persistence, or data exfiltration."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including hostname, operating system name, and IP address, then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://eowdq5q6u6qkhxe.m.pipedream.net/poc) without any user interaction or consent. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The hardcoded external endpoint is suspicious and likely attacker-controlled. This pattern of silent environment data collection and exfiltration to an external server is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the data sent could be used for further exploitation or tracking. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior."
