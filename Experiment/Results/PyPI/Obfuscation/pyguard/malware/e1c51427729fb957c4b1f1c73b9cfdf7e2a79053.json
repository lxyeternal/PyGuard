      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command that, upon package installation, automatically downloads an executable file named 'DigitalPulse.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It then writes this executable to the current working directory and immediately executes it using a shell command ('start DigitalPulse.exe') on Windows platforms. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic, combined with the automatic download and execution of an external binary from an untrusted source, strongly indicates malicious intent."
