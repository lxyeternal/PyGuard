      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses an extremely obfuscated and complex expression to dynamically construct a string that is then executed via exec(). This obfuscation technique is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it attempts to hide the actual code being run. The use of exec on dynamically generated code, especially in a setup script context, is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery. The obfuscation prevents easy static analysis and suggests the code is executing hidden or unauthorized actions during package installation. Although the visible part of the code calls setup() with typical metadata, the prior exec() call likely executes malicious code. This pattern aligns with known malicious behaviors such as code obfuscation, dynamic code execution during installation, and evasion of detection, all of which are critical risk indicators of malware."
