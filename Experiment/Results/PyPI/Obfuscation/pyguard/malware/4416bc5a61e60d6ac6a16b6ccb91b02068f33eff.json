      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell scripts. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW and '-WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window without user interaction—is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly used for payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign and unrelated, likely included to disguise the malicious payload within a package setup script. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy execution of hidden PowerShell commands via obfuscated payloads."
