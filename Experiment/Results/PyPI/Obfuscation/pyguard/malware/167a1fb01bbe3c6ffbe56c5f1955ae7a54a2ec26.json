      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell command is run with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user awareness. The use of an obfuscated (base64-encoded) PowerShell command executed silently in the background is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common method for executing hidden payloads, downloading or running further malware, or performing unauthorized system modifications. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but does not mitigate or justify the hidden PowerShell execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy execution of potentially harmful commands during package installation."
