      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute decrypted code at install time. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The code runs this without any user interaction or consent, and the obfuscated variable and class names indicate an attempt to evade detection. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data, combined with network-related imports and execution during installation, strongly indicates malicious intent. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
