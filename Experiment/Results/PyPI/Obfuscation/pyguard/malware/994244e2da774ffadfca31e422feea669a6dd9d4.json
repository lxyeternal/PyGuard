      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script that contains a command to download and execute code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/c24j2/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code without any validation or user consent is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. Furthermore, the code attempts to execute this temporary script by spawning a new Python process with a modified executable name (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'), which is a known technique to run Python scripts in a hidden window on Windows systems, indicating stealthy execution. The presence of obfuscated variable names and the execution of arbitrary remote code during the setup process (package installation) strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user interaction or notification."
