      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to asynchronously send the host's hostname and IP address to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the hardcoded external webhook URL, and the execution of network communication during installation (a non-interactive context) strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code silently collects and transmits sensitive environment data, which is a critical risk indicator of malware."
