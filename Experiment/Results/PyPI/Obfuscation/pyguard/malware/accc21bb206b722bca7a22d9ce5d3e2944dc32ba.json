      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware evasion technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be used as a marker or persistence check. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode without user interaction or notification strongly indicates malicious intent, such as downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms. Additionally, the presence of this behavior in a setup script context suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the code invoking setup() appears benign but is likely a cover or part of the malicious package installation process. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process creation, and execution during package setup is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
