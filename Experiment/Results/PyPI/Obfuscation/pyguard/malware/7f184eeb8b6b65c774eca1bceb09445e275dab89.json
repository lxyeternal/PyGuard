      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hidden malicious payload embedded within what appears to be a legitimate setup script. After the setup() call, the script attempts to collect sensitive environment information including the current working directory's last path component, the current user's username, and the hostname. It then constructs a string with this information, obfuscates it by XORing each character with a repeating key, and base64 encodes the result. The script then opens a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (decoded from base64) on a suspicious port (octal 017620 = decimal 7904) and sends an HTTP GET request containing the encoded data. This sequence is repeated twice in the code. The obfuscation, silent network communication during package installation, and exfiltration of user and system information without user consent are hallmark indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware. The use of try-except blocks suppresses errors to avoid detection. The code does not perform any legitimate user interaction or notification, and the network activity is unsolicited and hidden. Therefore, this code is malicious."
