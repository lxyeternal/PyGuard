      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the current username, hostname, and public IP address without user consent. It then writes a marker file with a hashed filename in the system's temporary directory to avoid repeated execution. Subsequently, it sends this collected data as a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://123.206.22.33:5000/p/). This exfiltration of user and environment data during package installation (via setuptools.setup call) is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The lack of user interaction, obfuscation of the filename, and silent network communication to an untrusted server strongly indicate malicious intent."
