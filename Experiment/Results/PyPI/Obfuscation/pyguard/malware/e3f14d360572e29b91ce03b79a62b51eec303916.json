      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell payloads. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution to avoid repeated or unnecessary runs. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it involves obfuscated code execution in a hidden context without user interaction or consent. Additionally, the use of distutils.setup with a suspicious package name ('tavg1x8uy4ahp7mq') and the presence of try/except blocks suppressing errors further indicate attempts to evade detection and analysis. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and suspicious package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
