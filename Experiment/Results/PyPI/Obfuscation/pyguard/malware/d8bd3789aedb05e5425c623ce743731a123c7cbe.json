      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to evade repeated detection or to target specific environments. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name, which may be an attempt to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package installation script. The overall pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscated PowerShell execution during package setup/install phases, a common supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
