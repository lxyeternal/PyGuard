      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded strings that are decoded and immediately executed via exec(), which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The code differentiates behavior based on the operating system, executing a large base64-decoded payload on Windows (nt) systems, which includes writing and executing a suspicious executable file in the temporary directory with a randomized name and .exe extension, running it in hidden mode, and then deleting it. On non-Windows systems, it performs similar obfuscated operations involving network requests, process spawning, and execution of potentially harmful commands. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means it executes during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. It also imports modules and uses functions commonly associated with malware, such as threading, base64 decoding, os and sys manipulations, and network communications. The presence of hardcoded suspicious domains, encoded PowerShell commands, and immediate execution of decoded data without validation further confirm its malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily deploy and execute malicious payloads, exfiltrate data, and evade detection, making it highly dangerous."
