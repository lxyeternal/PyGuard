      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function that collects all environment variables from the host system and encodes them as URL parameters. It then attempts to send this encoded environment data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app'). This exfiltration occurs automatically during the package installation or development setup phases by overriding setuptools 'install' and 'develop' commands, causing the data leak without user interaction or consent. The function and variable names are obfuscated, and the network communication to an attacker-controlled domain during installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The code lacks any legitimate business logic or user notification, and the use of environment variable collection combined with immediate exfiltration to a suspicious endpoint strongly indicates malicious intent."
