      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, fully qualified domain name, IP address, current working directory, and the username of the user running the install. It then sends this collected information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://cas54n1gfihn6082nil0kz451ubndy6rt.dooracle.in') without any user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic example of automated data exfiltration during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup install hook to silently collect and transmit such environment data to an unknown external server. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
