      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it silently, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, but the key malicious behavior is the hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during import or setup. This pattern matches known malware behaviors such as stealthy code execution, obfuscation, and potential payload delivery or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
