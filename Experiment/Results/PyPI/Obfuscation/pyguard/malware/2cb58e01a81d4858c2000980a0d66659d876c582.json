      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious payloads. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'WindowStyle Hidden' and 'CREATE_NO_WINDOW' flags suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly observed in malware for payload delivery, persistence, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but does not mitigate the suspicious subprocess invocation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
