      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated code without user consent or interaction during package installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscated variable names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during installation further confirm this is malicious code designed to run hidden payloads on the victim's system."
