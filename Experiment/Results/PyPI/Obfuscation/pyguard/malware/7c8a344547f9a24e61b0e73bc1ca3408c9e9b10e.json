      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be used as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. The subsequent call to setup() appears benign but is likely a decoy or part of a supply chain attack vector to disguise malicious activity during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in hidden mode, lack of user consent, and suppression of errors strongly indicates malicious behavior."
