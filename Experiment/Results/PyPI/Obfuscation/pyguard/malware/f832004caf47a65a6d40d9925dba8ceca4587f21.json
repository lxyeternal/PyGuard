      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install process to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. The function tvrAQIYoOjmMWoRDqRHQdZafINxbURTG collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (host identifier) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation new c kw <COMPUTERNAME>', which is a form of silent data exfiltration. Furthermore, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe' in the current directory, and immediately executes it using 'os.system' with the 'start' command. This sequence of downloading and executing a remote binary during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and a hallmark of malware. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names to evade detection and suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction, validation, or notification, and the behavior is triggered automatically on install. These factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
