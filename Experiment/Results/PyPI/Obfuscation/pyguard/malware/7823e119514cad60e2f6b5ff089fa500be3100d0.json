      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command being executed. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag further indicates stealthy execution without user notification. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution of encoded PowerShell commands are hallmark behaviors of malware, often used for privilege escalation, persistence, or downloading/executing further payloads. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign but is likely a cover or delivery mechanism. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
