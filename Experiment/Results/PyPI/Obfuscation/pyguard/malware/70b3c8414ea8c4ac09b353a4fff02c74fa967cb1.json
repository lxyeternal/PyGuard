      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealthy process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which strongly suggest malicious behavior."
