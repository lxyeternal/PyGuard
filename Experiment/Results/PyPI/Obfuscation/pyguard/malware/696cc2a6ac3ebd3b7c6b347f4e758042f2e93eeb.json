      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a shell command that is executed during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). The decoded shell command runs a pip install for the 'requests' package, then executes a Python script 'main.pyw' multiple times, which itself imports 'requests' and performs a GET request to a suspicious GitHub URL that appears to be a raw executable file ('ip_checker.exe'). The command writes the content of this URL to 'main.pyw' and then executes it repeatedly. This pattern of obfuscation, automatic downloading, writing, and execution of remote code during package installation without user consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of base64 to hide the shell command, the execution of arbitrary code during install, the download of an executable from an external source, and the repeated execution of that code all strongly indicate malicious intent."
