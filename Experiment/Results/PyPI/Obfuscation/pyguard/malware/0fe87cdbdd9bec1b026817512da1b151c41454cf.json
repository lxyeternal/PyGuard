      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands during the package setup process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it runs a DNS query command ('dig @1.1.1.1 install14.api.pygrata.com') and then attempts to upgrade a package ('pygrata-utils') via pip. This behavior is suspicious because: 1) It performs network communication during installation, contacting a potentially attacker-controlled domain ('install14.api.pygrata.com'). 2) It silently executes subprocess commands in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which is a common evasion technique. 3) The package name ('czu33v77hrg40wmu') and keywords ('pygrata2') appear random or obfuscated, which is typical in typosquatting or malicious packages. 4) Running arbitrary shell commands during installation is a known vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with supply chain attack patterns and remote code execution during package installation."
