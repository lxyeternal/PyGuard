      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a hidden payload as a string variable containing code that establishes a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (120.76.194.25) on port 20080. This payload supports both Windows and Linux platforms, spawning a command shell (cmd.exe or /bin/bash) and redirecting input/output over a socket, effectively providing remote command execution capabilities. The payload is written to a file named 'remote-access.py' in the user's home or Documents directory without user consent or notification. The custom install command class (subclassing setuptools.command.install.install) overrides the install process to write this payload file and then silently launch it in a background subprocess during package installation. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code executes automatically during package installation, establishing a backdoor on the victim machine. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded attacker-controlled IP, network socket communication, spawning of shell processes, and execution of code during install time with no user interaction or legitimate purpose confirms the code is malicious."
