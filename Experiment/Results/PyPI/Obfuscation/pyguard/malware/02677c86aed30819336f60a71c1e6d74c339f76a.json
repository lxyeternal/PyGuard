      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract a sensitive authentication token (the Roblox '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie) from the Windows registry without user consent or notification. It then exfiltrates this sensitive credential by sending it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL controlled by an attacker. This behavior constitutes credential theft and unauthorized data exfiltration. The code uses no user interaction or legitimate business logic, suppresses errors silently, and directly sends stolen credentials to an external endpoint, which is a hallmark of malicious activity. The presence of a hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URL combined with automated extraction and transmission of authentication cookies classifies this code as malicious."
