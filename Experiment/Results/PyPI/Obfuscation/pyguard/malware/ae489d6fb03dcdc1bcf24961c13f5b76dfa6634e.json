      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command, which is a common evasion and stealth technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden process, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these behaviors align with known malware patterns such as stealthy code execution, obfuscation, and potential payload delivery or system compromise."
