      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads to be executed silently. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors and hides execution failures, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns such as obfuscated code execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of installation hooks for unauthorized code execution."
