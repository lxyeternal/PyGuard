      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window style), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this process, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with encoded commands, combined with the hidden window style and lack of user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The setup call itself appears benign but is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which may be used to hide malicious activity. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a critical risk indicator of malware behavior."
