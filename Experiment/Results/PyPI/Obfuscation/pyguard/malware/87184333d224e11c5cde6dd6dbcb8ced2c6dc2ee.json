      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains further instructions that are not visible in the source, but the use of encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
