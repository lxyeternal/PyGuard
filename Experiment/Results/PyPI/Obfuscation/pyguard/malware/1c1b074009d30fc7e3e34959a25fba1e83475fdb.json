      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information (all environment variables) and encodes it in base64. It then sends this encoded data along with the current username and IP address (retrieved via hostname -I) to a suspicious external URL (https://eo6sl0hu84cr4pa.m.pipedream.net) without any user consent or notification. The variable names are obfuscated, and the code is executed during the setuptools setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The printed message falsely claims to be a security package but indicates the machine is compromised, which is suspicious. The combination of environment data collection, base64 encoding, and automatic exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
