      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted payload conceal the true intent of the code, which is typical of malware attempting to evade detection. The setup call installs this malicious install command hook, ensuring the payload runs automatically on installation. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a standard setuptools setup script, and the presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptographic decryption (fernet) combined with dynamic code execution during install strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism."
