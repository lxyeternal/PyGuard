      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it executes a shell command during the package setup process that performs a network request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled URL (http://canarytokens.com/images/static/brqx28acq8gohneyj1yvhcknu/contact.php) using os.system with curl. This occurs without any user interaction or consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution attempts. The URL is not related to the package's legitimate functionality and is likely used for data exfiltration or triggering a remote payload. Additionally, the setup call includes suspicious, obfuscated-looking keyword arguments (e.g., 'LwiGHRYEdwUQmxtAtyrXgheqZekrCwZn', 'SfzVMhogvcXLJPbzQyvwzefIvWtUBHYd') and a URL pointing to 'https://evil.com', further indicating malicious intent. Executing arbitrary shell commands during installation to contact external servers is a strong indicator of malware or a supply chain attack."
