      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. It uses obfuscated variable and function names and base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and immediately written to files in a temporary '__pycache__' directory under the user's AppData local temp folder. These files ('main.cpython-39.py' and 'scripts.cpython-39.py') contain further obfuscated code that is executed via subprocess.Popen calls using 'pythonw.exe' in hidden mode, which suppresses any user interface or notification. The code collects extensive environment and user information, including user profile paths, browser cookies (via browser_cookie3), and system details, and sends this data encoded over HTTP POST requests to suspicious or attacker-controlled endpoints. It also attempts to stealthily write and execute additional scripts during the package installation process (triggered by setuptools or distutils setup commands), a classic supply chain attack vector. The presence of subprocess calls with obfuscated PowerShell commands, base64 decoding followed by execution, writing to temp directories, and network communication to non-standard or suspicious URLs (including pythonanywhere.com and IP addresses) further confirm malicious intent. The code also includes mechanisms to evade detection by running in background, suppressing output, and using threading for asynchronous execution. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive user data, execute arbitrary code, and exfiltrate information without user consent, which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
