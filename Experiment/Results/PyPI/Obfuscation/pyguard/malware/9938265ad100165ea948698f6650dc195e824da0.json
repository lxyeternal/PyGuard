      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including a hardcoded string ('vn7w1ohhyl1479x7'), the hostname, the current user, and the current working directory. It then serializes this data to JSON, encodes it as a UTF-8 hex string, splits it into chunks, and constructs multiple DNS-like domain names embedding these chunks. It attempts to resolve these constructed domain names via socket.getaddrinfo, effectively sending the encoded environment data to a suspicious external domain ('krfdjo3y14gnxlmuyzp4gb7ufllc92xr.oastify.com'). This behavior is a classic example of covert data exfiltration using DNS queries during package installation, without user consent or notification. The obfuscated variable names, the use of a non-standard domain, and the execution of network calls during install strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and information stealing malware."
