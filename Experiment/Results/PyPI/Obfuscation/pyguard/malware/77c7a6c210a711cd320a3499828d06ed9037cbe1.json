      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It programmatically extracts Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers using the 'browser_cookie3' library without user consent, which is a direct breach of user privacy and security. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects extensive user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, creation date, and premium status via Roblox APIs. The script proceeds to exfiltrate this sensitive information, including the stolen cookie and the user's IP address, by sending HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The variable and function names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. There is no user interaction or notification, and the data collection and exfiltration happen automatically. This pattern matches known credential-stealing malware behavior, specifically targeting Roblox accounts for unauthorized access and potential abuse. Therefore, the code is malicious."
