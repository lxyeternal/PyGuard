      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (104.248.19.57) on port 3333 and redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket. It then spawns a pseudo-terminal shell (/bin/sh) connected to this socket. This effectively creates a reverse shell back to the attacker's server, allowing remote command execution on the victim's machine. The code executes this behavior automatically during package installation without any user interaction or notification, which is a classic hallmark of a supply chain attack and remote access trojan (RAT). The obfuscated class and method names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for such network connections and shell spawning during a Python package install, confirming the code is malicious."
