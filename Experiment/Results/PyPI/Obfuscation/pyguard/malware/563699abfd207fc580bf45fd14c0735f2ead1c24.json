      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that execute a function during package installation. This function downloads an executable file named 'Cleaner.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://a4a08d21-3950-435e-8b39-12ab7788cd10.id.repl.co/Cleaner.exe') without any user consent or validation. After downloading, it writes the executable to the current directory and immediately executes it using a shell command with environment variable manipulation ('set __COMPACT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker | start Cleaner.exe'). This pattern of downloading and executing an external binary during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The code also uses obfuscated variable and function names, which is a common evasion technique. There is no legitimate user interaction, no integrity checks, and no benign purpose evident. The presence of network communication to a suspicious domain, file writing of an executable, and immediate execution during install time confirms this code is malicious."
