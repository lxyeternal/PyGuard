      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated base64-encoded URLs to contact external endpoints that are not standard or trusted domains (e.g., discordapp.com API endpoints combined with base64 decoding of suspicious URLs). It collects sensitive user information such as Discord authentication tokens, usernames, IDs, emails, phone numbers, friends, servers, and DM channels without user consent. This information is then exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to attacker-controlled webhook URLs (decoded from base64). The function hNGMlOXNuQXCnQIAEaNOAFSizedtiXAe sends detailed user data to a hidden webhook, indicating credential or identity theft. The code also uses threading to run this exfiltration in the background, evading detection. Variable and function names are heavily obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The code performs network requests to Discord API endpoints using the provided authorization token, which is sensitive information, and sends this data to external servers. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the data exfiltration is automatic. These behaviors align with known patterns of credential-stealing malware and data exfiltration tools. Therefore, the code is malicious."
