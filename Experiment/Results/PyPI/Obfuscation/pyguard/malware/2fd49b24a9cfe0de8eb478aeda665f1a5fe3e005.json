      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a Python setuptools install hook that executes automatically during package installation. It collects system information such as the current working directory name, the platform identifier, the current username (via 'whoami'), and the user's home directory. It then constructs and executes shell commands using 'curl' to silently send HTTP GET requests to a hardcoded external IP address (http://3.221.152.203:8000) with these collected details embedded in the URL path. This behavior constitutes automated, silent exfiltration of sensitive environment and user information without user consent or notification. The obfuscated function and variable names, the use of os.popen to execute shell commands, the suppression of command output, and the execution of this code during the install phase (via a custom install class overriding setuptools install) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. Such patterns are consistent with supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware that leverage package installation hooks to gather and exfiltrate system data to attacker-controlled servers."
