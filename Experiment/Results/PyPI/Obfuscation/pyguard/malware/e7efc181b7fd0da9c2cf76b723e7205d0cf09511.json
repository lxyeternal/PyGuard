      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during installation, executes obfuscated code. The obfuscation is done by XORing a long string with a numeric key string, then the resulting decoded string is executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The code suppresses errors silently (try/except pass), which is typical for malware to evade detection. The package name is suspicious and randomly generated, which is common in malicious PyPI packages. There is no legitimate reason for executing arbitrary decoded code during installation, especially without user interaction or notification. These factors strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
