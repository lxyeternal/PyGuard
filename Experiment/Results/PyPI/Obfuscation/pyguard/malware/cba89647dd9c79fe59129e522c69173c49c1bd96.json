      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a keylogger that silently captures keystrokes without user consent or notification. It uses the 'pynput' library to listen to keyboard events, collects all typed characters including special keys (e.g., enter, backspace, space), and stores them in obfuscated variable names. After capturing input, it writes the logged keystrokes to a file in a relative path '../data/data_file' without user interaction. Subsequently, it sends the collected keystroke data via email using hardcoded SMTP credentials (including sender email and password) to a specified recipient email address. This automated collection and exfiltration of sensitive user input (potentially including passwords, personal messages, and other confidential data) without user knowledge or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior. The obfuscation of variable and function names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code runs the keylogger listener and immediately sends the logged data via email upon termination (e.g., pressing ESC). These characteristics align with typical malicious patterns of credential stealing and data exfiltration malware."
