      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. It hijacks the Python package installation process by overriding setuptools install and develop commands to execute malicious functions automatically during package installation. The code collects sensitive user data by recursively searching for all '*.env' files on the system (which often contain secrets and credentials) and reading their contents. It also collects all environment variables. Both the collected environment data and the contents of the '.env' files are base64-encoded and exfiltrated via HTTP GET requests to a hardcoded suspicious external URL (http://bellazik.000webhostapp.com:443). Additionally, it attempts to read the user's SSH private key (~/.ssh/id_rsa), base64-encodes it, and sends it to the same external server, which is a critical security breach and credential theft. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to evade detection and uses subprocess calls to execute shell commands (including PowerShell on Windows) to locate sensitive files. There is no user interaction or consent, and the data exfiltration happens silently during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. These behaviors—automatic execution on install, collection of sensitive files and environment variables, obfuscation, and exfiltration to attacker-controlled domains—are definitive hallmarks of malicious code."
