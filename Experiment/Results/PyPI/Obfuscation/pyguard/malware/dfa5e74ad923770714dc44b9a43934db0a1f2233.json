      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and data exfiltration tools. It imports numerous modules commonly used in malware, including 'requests', 'psutil', 'browser_cookie3', 'cryptography', and 'dhooks'. The code collects extensive system information such as hostname, local and public IP addresses, MAC address, geolocation data, CPU, memory, disk, and network statistics. It attempts to locate and extract Discord tokens and browser-stored credentials by scanning local storage leveldb files and decrypting Chrome passwords using Windows cryptographic APIs. The code writes stolen credentials to files in system directories and archives them. It takes screenshots and prepares detailed embeds with victim data, sending all collected information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common exfiltration method. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, lacks user interaction or consent, and performs all actions silently in the background. It also attempts to delete traces of its activity by removing temporary files. These behaviors—silent credential harvesting, system fingerprinting, data packaging, and exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints—are hallmark traits of malicious information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
