      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (via os.getcwd()), and the username of the current user (via getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io'. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user identity information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The obfuscated class and variable names, combined with the execution of network communication during package installation, are strong indicators of a supply chain attack or malicious package. Such behavior is a hallmark of malware that performs environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during installation, which is a critical risk pattern exclusively observed in malware samples."
