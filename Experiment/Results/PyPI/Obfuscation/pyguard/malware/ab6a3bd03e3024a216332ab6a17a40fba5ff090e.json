      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('launcher.exe') from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or validation. It writes this executable to the current working directory, immediately executes it via os.system, and then deletes the executable file. This sequence—automatic download of a binary from an untrusted remote source, silent execution, and self-deletion—is a classic hallmark of malware behavior. There is no indication of legitimate business logic, user consent, or integrity checks. The use of a non-standard URL (Discord CDN) to host the executable further raises suspicion. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious payload delivery, remote code execution, and potential system compromise."
