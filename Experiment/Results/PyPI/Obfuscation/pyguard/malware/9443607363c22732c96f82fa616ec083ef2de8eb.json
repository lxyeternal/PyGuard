      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that downloads an executable file ('pics.exe') from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a GitHub raw content URL under a user repository) without any user consent or validation. After downloading, it attempts to execute this file using subprocess.Popen, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This download-and-execute sequence is triggered automatically during the package installation process by overriding the setuptools 'install' command class, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, which is a common evasion technique. The presence of base64 decoding functions, although not directly used in the execution path shown, suggests potential for further obfuscation or payload delivery. The combination of network retrieval of an executable, writing it to disk, and immediate execution during installation without user interaction or notification is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a high security risk."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'pics.exe' from a hardcoded URL hosted on a GitHub repository controlled by an unknown user. It writes this executable to the current working directory without any user interaction or consent. Immediately after downloading, it attempts to execute this file using subprocess.Popen, which runs the executable potentially without any visibility to the user. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The behavior of downloading a binary from an untrusted external source and executing it directly is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. There is no validation, user notification, or security checks before execution. The repeated definitions of functions that perform the same malicious action further indicate an attempt to obfuscate or evade detection. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as automated file download and execution, obfuscated code, use of subprocess to spawn executables from untrusted sources, and lack of user consent or interaction. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
