      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names and the use of exec on decrypted data without any user interaction or validation strongly indicate malicious intent. The code effectively executes hidden arbitrary code on the user's system during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise."
