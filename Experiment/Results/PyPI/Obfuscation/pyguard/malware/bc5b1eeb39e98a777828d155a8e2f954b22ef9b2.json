      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is a setup script that conditionally executes obfuscated, base64-encoded payloads during installation, depending on the operating system. For Windows ('nt'), it decodes and executes a large base64-encoded string that, upon analysis, performs actions such as creating files in system directories, executing PowerShell commands in hidden mode, downloading and running additional payloads, and exfiltrating system and user information to hardcoded external IP addresses and URLs. For non-Windows systems, it similarly decodes and executes another base64-encoded payload that performs network requests, process spawning, and environment reconnaissance. The code uses obfuscation techniques (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution (exec), and performs network communication to suspicious endpoints without user consent or notification. It also attempts to collect sensitive information such as user credentials, browser cookies, and system details, and sends them to attacker-controlled servers. These behaviors are consistent with supply chain attacks, remote code execution, data exfiltration, and persistence mechanisms commonly found in malware. The absence of any legitimate user interaction, the use of encoded commands, and the execution of arbitrary code during package installation further confirm the malicious nature of this code."
