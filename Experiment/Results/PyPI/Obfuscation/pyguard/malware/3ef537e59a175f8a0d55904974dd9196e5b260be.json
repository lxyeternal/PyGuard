      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute a shell command via subprocess. This shell command uses 'curl' to fetch a script from a hardcoded external IP address (http://13.93.28.37:8080/p) and pipes it directly to 'perl' for execution. This pattern is a classic example of remote code execution during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The code executes untrusted remote code without any user interaction or validation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. The obfuscated class and method names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware and is considered highly malicious."
