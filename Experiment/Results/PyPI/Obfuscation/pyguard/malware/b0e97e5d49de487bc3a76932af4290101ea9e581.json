      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script file containing code that downloads and executes Python code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/7byac/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using the Python interpreter in a new process. This pattern of dynamically fetching and executing remote code during package setup is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The code uses obfuscated variable names and performs code execution without user consent or validation. The remote URL is not a known trusted source, and the downloaded code is executed directly without any integrity checks, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. This behavior is strongly associated with malware and is a critical risk indicator."
