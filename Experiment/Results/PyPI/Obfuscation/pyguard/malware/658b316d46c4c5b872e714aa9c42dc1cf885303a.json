      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a direct call to os.system with a shell command that downloads and executes a script from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://108.61.251.172:8080/revssh/108.61.251.172/2222) using curl piped to /bin/bash. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling remote code execution without user consent or validation. The rest of the code appears to be a typical Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names, but the immediate execution of remote code during import or setup is a critical risk and strongly indicative of malware. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as fetching and executing code from an untrusted external source, lack of user interaction, and execution during package installation or import, which are common vectors for supply chain attacks and remote access trojans."
