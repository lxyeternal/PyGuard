      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class for setuptools that registers a function to be executed at program exit. This function encodes the system's fully qualified domain name (hostname) in base64 and constructs a URL to a suspicious, hardcoded external server (a Herokuapp domain) with the hostname appended as a query parameter. It then silently downloads a file named 'logo.png' from this remote URL and writes it to the local directory where the script resides. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation without any user interaction or consent. The obfuscated function and variable names, the use of base64 encoding for the hostname, the silent network communication to an attacker-controlled server, and the writing of a file from an untrusted source during installation are all hallmark signs of a supply chain attack or malware. The code does not perform any legitimate or benign setup tasks and instead performs environment fingerprinting and remote file retrieval, which can be used for further exploitation or payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
