      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function with obfuscated names that reads sensitive system information such as system uptime from '/proc/uptime', detailed OS and platform information, and network interface addresses via psutil. It then constructs a string combining this information and opens a socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090, sending the collected system information without any user consent or notification. Furthermore, the code hooks into the setuptools installation process by subclassing the 'install' command and overriding a method to execute this data collection and exfiltration function automatically during package installation. This behavior is characteristic of supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation to silently collect and exfiltrate environment and system data. The obfuscated function and variable names, lack of user interaction, hardcoded attacker-controlled IP, and automatic execution during install strongly indicate malicious intent."
