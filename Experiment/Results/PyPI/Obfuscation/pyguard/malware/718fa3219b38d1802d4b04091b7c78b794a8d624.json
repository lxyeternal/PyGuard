      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It defines a Python setuptools install command subclass that, during package installation, writes a Python script named 'remote-access.py' to the user's home directory (or Documents folder on Windows). This script establishes a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (120.76.194.25) on port 1234, enabling remote command execution on the victim's machine. The reverse shell implementation supports both Windows and Linux platforms, spawning a command shell ('cmd' on Windows, '/bin/bash' on Linux) connected to the remote socket. The installation hook immediately launches this script in the background without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded attacker-controlled IP, network socket connection, spawning of shell subprocesses, and execution triggered automatically during package installation are all strong indicators of a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. This behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation to gain unauthorized remote access and control over the victim system."
