      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during installation, collects all environment variables from the host system and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL ('https://a5gpivpedls2wjfxl0bm6dmwenke84wt.oastify.com'). This exfiltration of environment variables occurs silently without any user interaction or consent. The class and method names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain for data exfiltration during package installation is a classic supply chain attack pattern. Such behavior is strongly associated with malicious intent, specifically data theft and reconnaissance, and is not typical of benign packages. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
