      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive environment and system information such as AWS IAM security credentials from the EC2 metadata service, AWS credentials files, SSH keys, environment variables, hostname, current working directory, username, and IP address information. It aggregates this data into text files with randomized names and silently exfiltrates the collected information via HTTP POST requests to suspicious, hardcoded external URLs (http://graphs.pygrata.com/uploader.php and http://graphs.pygrata.com/api.php) without any user interaction or consent. The code uses obfuscated variable names and base64 encoding/decoding to obscure parts of its operation. It also performs DNS queries to attacker-controlled domains derived from encoded usernames, likely for tracking or command-and-control purposes. The entire data collection and exfiltration process is triggered automatically during package setup (via distutils.core.setup), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess calls to execute shell commands for reading sensitive files and environment data, combined with network exfiltration to suspicious endpoints, confirms this code is designed for unauthorized data theft and remote information leakage, consistent with credential-stealing malware."
