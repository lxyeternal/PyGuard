      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions that are not visible in the source, but the use of encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly used for downloading/executing payloads, persistence, or system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
