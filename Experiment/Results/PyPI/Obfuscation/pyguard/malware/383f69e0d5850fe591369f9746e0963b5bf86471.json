      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the installation process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, attacker-controlled domain ('jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com') without any user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a package installation script to silently collect and transmit such environment data to an external server. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
