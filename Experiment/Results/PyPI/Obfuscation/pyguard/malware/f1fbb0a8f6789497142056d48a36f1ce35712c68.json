      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, likely as a persistence or evasion mechanism. This behavior—executing obfuscated PowerShell commands silently during package setup—is a hallmark of malicious activity, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or system compromise. The use of distutils setup with no legitimate user interaction or notification, combined with the hidden execution of obfuscated shell commands, strongly indicates a supply chain attack or malware embedded in the installation process. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
