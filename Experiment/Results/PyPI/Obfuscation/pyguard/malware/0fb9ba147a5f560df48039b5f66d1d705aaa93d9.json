      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the current login username, hostname, platform details, and local IP address without user consent. It then encodes this information using base64 with a slight obfuscation prefix and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://127.70.159.15:60006) which is not a standard or trusted endpoint. This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the package setup process, meaning it executes upon installation without user interaction or notification. The use of obfuscated variable and function names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and silent network transmission to a non-legitimate server is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package's installation routine."
