      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes code during package installation without user interaction or consent. It imports discord-related modules and uses a hardcoded Discord webhook URL to send the host's hostname and IP address asynchronously. This behavior constitutes automated collection and exfiltration of system information to an attacker-controlled endpoint during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The obfuscated class and method names, lack of legitimate user interaction, and direct network communication to a hardcoded webhook URL strongly indicate malicious intent."
