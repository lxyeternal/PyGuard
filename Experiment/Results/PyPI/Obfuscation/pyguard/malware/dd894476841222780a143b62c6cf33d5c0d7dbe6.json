      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It programmatically extracts Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers using the 'browser_cookie3' library without user consent, which is a direct breach of user privacy and security. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects extensive user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, creation date, and premium status via Roblox APIs. The script also retrieves the public IP address of the host machine. All this sensitive information, including the stolen .ROBLOSECURITY cookie, is then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. The variable and function names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and transmission. The combination of stealthy cookie theft, user data harvesting, and automated exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint classifies this code as malicious, specifically as credential-stealing malware targeting Roblox users."
