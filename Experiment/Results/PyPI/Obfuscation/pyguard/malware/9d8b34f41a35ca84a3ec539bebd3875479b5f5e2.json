      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is designed to run without user interaction or notification, in a hidden window, which is a known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The presence of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with spawning PowerShell in hidden mode is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used for executing unauthorized commands, downloading or running further payloads, or performing system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try-except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction associated with this behavior, and the suspicious subprocess call is unrelated to the setup function call that follows. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
