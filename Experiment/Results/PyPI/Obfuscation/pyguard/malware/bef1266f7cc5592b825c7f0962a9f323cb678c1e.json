      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. It uses base64 decoding to write obfuscated Python and VBScript files into a temporary directory under the user's AppData local temp folder, then immediately executes a VBScript via WScript to run the decoded Python script. This decoded script contains extensive functionality for stealthy data collection and exfiltration, including: - Gathering user environment information such as username, hostnames, and local paths. - Collecting sensitive files and directories including browser cookies (via browser_cookie3), user documents, downloads, desktop, roaming profiles, and program files. - Decrypting and decoding stored credentials and tokens, including Chrome cookies and passwords. - Using asynchronous HTTP POST requests to exfiltrate collected data to hardcoded suspicious endpoints. - Writing and executing multiple plugin modules that perform credential theft, environment reconnaissance, and data exfiltration. - Spawning subprocesses and threads to execute shell commands and maintain persistence. - Obfuscation through base64 encoding, unusual variable names, and dynamic code execution during package installation. - Use of environment variables to locate user-specific directories and write executable payloads. - Execution triggered automatically during package installation (setup.py), without user interaction or consent. - Writing files to obscure locations and running PowerShell commands in hidden mode. - Use of subprocess.Popen with shell=True to run scripts silently. - Hardcoded suspicious IP addresses and URLs for data exfiltration. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including supply chain attacks, credential theft, remote code execution, and data exfiltration. The code does not perform any legitimate user-facing functionality, lacks transparency, and attempts to evade detection by obfuscation and stealth techniques. Therefore, this code is conclusively malicious."
