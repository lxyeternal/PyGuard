      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It hijacks the Python package installation process by overriding the 'install' command class in setuptools to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it checks if the platform is Linux, then executes a shell command that runs a bash script fetched via curl from a suspicious and obfuscated URL 'gsocket.io/x' with a hardcoded string parameter. This remote script execution without user consent or validation is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable and function names, suppression of command output ('> /dev/null'), and immediate execution of remote code during install strongly indicate malicious intent. The package name and author information appear suspicious and unrelated to the actual behavior. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving remote code execution during package installation, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery."
