      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4) and immediately uses the retrieved content as a URL to send a POST request with a payload that appears to be a message pinging everyone, which suggests unauthorized data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. It then generates a random filename and downloads Python code from another suspicious URL (https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode), writes this code to a local file, and immediately executes it via subprocess.Popen without any validation or user consent. This sequence of downloading and executing remote code dynamically is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise. Additionally, this behavior is embedded within a setuptools.setup call, indicating that the malicious actions occur during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated or meaningless variable names and the lack of legitimate user interaction further support the malicious intent. Overall, the code downloads and executes untrusted code from external sources, sends data to attacker-controlled endpoints, and runs payloads without user knowledge, confirming it is malicious."
