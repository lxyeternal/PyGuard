      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It programmatically extracts Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers using the 'browser_cookie3' library without user consent. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects extensive user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, and profile details via Roblox APIs. The script also retrieves the public IP address of the host. All this sensitive information, including the Roblox security cookie, is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is attacker-controlled. The variable and function names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no user interaction or notification, and the data collection and exfiltration happen automatically. This pattern of silently stealing authentication tokens and user data and sending them to an external server is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware. Therefore, the code is malicious."
