      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. It defines a custom setuptools install command class that overrides the install process to perform unauthorized actions during package installation. Specifically, it scans a system directory '/Library/Application Support' for subdirectories matching a pattern, encodes the path, and compares it against a hardcoded byte sequence to identify a target. Upon a match, it constructs obfuscated URLs based on the system architecture, downloads a remote payload from these URLs, decrypts it using a multi-layered SHA3-512 based generator and XOR operations, writes the decrypted binary to a hidden local directory (~/.local/bin/donothing), sets executable permissions, and silently executes it via subprocess.Popen with output suppressed. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, layered cryptographic transformations, and dynamic URL construction to evade detection. It performs network communication without user consent, writes executable files to user directories, and executes them automatically during installation, all hallmark behaviors of malware. The absence of any legitimate user interaction, the use of obfuscation, remote payload fetching, and execution during package installation strongly indicate this is a malicious payload delivery and execution mechanism embedded in a Python package setup script."
