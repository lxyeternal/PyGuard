      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install process to execute additional code during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The function GHCtqAlIlysSTYJJCtUKjXPntDQMqAQq collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (host identifier) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', indicating silent exfiltration of system information without user consent. Furthermore, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe' in the current directory, and immediately executes it using 'os.system' with the 'start' command. This sequence of downloading and executing a remote binary without validation or user interaction is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, suppresses exceptions silently, and performs network communication and file execution during installation, all of which are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the behavior aligns with known patterns of remote code execution, data exfiltration, and payload deployment in malicious Python packages."
