      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and a base64-encoded PowerShell command strongly indicates malicious intent, as it hides the execution window and obfuscates the payload. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further aiding stealth. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
