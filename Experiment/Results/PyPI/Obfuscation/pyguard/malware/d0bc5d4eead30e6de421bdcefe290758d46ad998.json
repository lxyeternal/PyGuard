      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden process, is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution and potential payload delivery or system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these behaviors strongly indicate malicious intent."
