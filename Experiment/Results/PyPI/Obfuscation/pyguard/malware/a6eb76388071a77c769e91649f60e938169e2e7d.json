      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the use of encoded PowerShell commands in hidden windows is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly used for executing payloads, downloading further malware, or performing system compromise without user consent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection or analysis. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
