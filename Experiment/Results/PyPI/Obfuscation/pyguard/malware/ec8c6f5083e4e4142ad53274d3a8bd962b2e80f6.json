This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware: automatic retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote source. The obfuscated variable names and the inclusion of this logic in what appears to be a setup script further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent and execute payloads during package installation or execution. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this behavior. Such automatic download and execution of remote binaries is strongly associated with malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and system compromise."
