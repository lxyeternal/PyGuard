      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to run stealthily without user awareness. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often associated with downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. This pattern aligns with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
