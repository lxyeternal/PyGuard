      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64 decoding combined with exec to dynamically execute obfuscated code, which is a classic malware technique for hiding payloads. The decoded code defines a 'run' function that uses subprocess.Popen to execute shell commands, which is then used to run PowerShell commands that download a ZIP archive from a suspicious external URL (https://transfer.sh/0tUIJu/Updater.zip) into a system directory (C:/ProgramData/Updater). The script then silently extracts the archive, removes the ZIP file, installs numerous Python packages (including ones commonly used in malware such as pycryptodome, pyperclip, pynput), and launches scripts (launch.vbs and server.pyw) from the extracted directory in hidden windows without user consent or notification. This sequence of downloading, extracting, installing dependencies, and executing code from an untrusted remote source during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of obfuscated variable names, suppression of output, and hidden execution further confirm malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying these actions. Therefore, this code is malicious."
