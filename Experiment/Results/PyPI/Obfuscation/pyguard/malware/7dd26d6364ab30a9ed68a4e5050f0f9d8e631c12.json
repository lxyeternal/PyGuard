      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that downloads a batch script ('install.bat') from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL hosted on Discord's CDN. This batch file is saved locally and then executed silently via os.system with a command that attempts to run it with reduced privileges ('RunAsInvoker'). The function veCWXCnfjifUTyWAzNEgUShJiOVJRXEr() is called automatically during both the 'develop' and 'install' setuptools commands, meaning the malicious payload is executed automatically during package installation or development setup without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated variable and function names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The behavior of downloading and executing an external script during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution on the victim's machine. There is no legitimate reason for this code to download and run an arbitrary batch file from an external source during setup. Therefore, this code is malicious."
