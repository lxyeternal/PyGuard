      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/936752659241771009/936753057998442506/Setup.exe) without any user interaction or consent, writes it to the current working directory as 'download.exe', and immediately executes it using os.startfile. This pattern of fetching a remote binary and executing it directly is a classic hallmark of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. There is no validation, user notification, or security checks before execution. The use of a Discord CDN URL to host the executable is suspicious and typical of attacker-controlled infrastructure. The function name is obfuscated and meaningless, which is a common evasion technique. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including downloading and executing remote code silently, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and lack of user consent or validation, confirming it is malicious."
