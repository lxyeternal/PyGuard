      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated function and variable names to evade detection. It base64-decodes a hardcoded URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/...) which is a suspicious external endpoint, likely attacker-controlled. The code collects sensitive environment information including the stack trace, environment variable keys, system uname details, and the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://ipinfo.io/ip'. It then packages this information into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL without any user consent or notification. The code also attempts to evade execution in certain environments by checking the hostname and the filename of the running script, skipping execution if they match specific values. After sending the data, it prints a message and immediately exits with a non-zero status, which is typical for malware to avoid further execution or detection. These behaviors—environment reconnaissance, data exfiltration to a hardcoded external webhook, obfuscation, and silent execution—are hallmark traits of information-stealing malware or a backdoor. Therefore, this code is malicious."
