      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names and encoded strings, which is a common tactic to evade detection. It dynamically imports modules using XOR-obfuscated strings, indicating an attempt to hide the true nature of the imports. The code constructs and executes decoded strings, including network requests to suspicious or obfuscated URLs, and writes files with obfuscated names. It uses threading to run background tasks without user interaction, and performs network communication likely for data exfiltration or command and control. The presence of obfuscated imports such as 'httpx_socks', dynamic attribute access, and execution of decoded payloads strongly suggests remote code execution capabilities. The code also appears to collect environment or system information and send it to external servers. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network communication to suspicious endpoints, file writing without user consent, and background thread execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with information stealing, remote code execution, and potential persistence or payload delivery."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names and encoded strings that are dynamically decoded at runtime. It imports modules dynamically using obfuscated names and constructs strings through XOR operations on byte sequences, a common obfuscation technique used to hide malicious intent. The code defines classes and functions that create threads, perform network requests, write files, and execute shell commands without any user interaction or notification. It downloads data from remote URLs, writes it to files, and executes it, which is a classic pattern of malware behavior. The code also includes mechanisms to wait for process completion, repeatedly execute certain functions, and perform environment reconnaissance. The presence of subprocess usage, dynamic imports, obfuscated network communication, file writing, and execution of decoded payloads strongly indicates that this code is designed for malicious purposes such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, network communication with suspicious endpoints, and automated payload deployment. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names and complex lambda functions, making it difficult to read and analyze directly. It uses dynamic imports with obfuscated module names, and numerous decoded strings constructed via XOR operations on byte sequences. The code appears to decode and reconstruct many strings and integers dynamically, which is a common obfuscation technique in malware. The presence of dynamic imports, obfuscated string decoding, and lambda functions for basic operations strongly suggests an attempt to hide the true intent of the code. Given the extensive obfuscation, the code likely performs unauthorized or hidden actions such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or environment reconnaissance. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious Python code, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and environment awareness. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
