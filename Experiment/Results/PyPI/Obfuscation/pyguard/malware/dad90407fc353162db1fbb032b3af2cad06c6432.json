      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and immediately executed via exec(), which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The code executes different payloads depending on the operating system, including a heavily obfuscated PowerShell command on Windows. The payloads perform actions such as writing files to system directories, spawning hidden processes, downloading and executing remote code, collecting system and user information, and sending data to suspicious external servers. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means it executes automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. There is no user interaction or consent, and the code attempts to evade detection by using threading and obfuscation. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, encoded commands, and direct execution of decoded data confirms that this code is designed to perform unauthorized actions, including potential credential theft, system compromise, and data exfiltration."
