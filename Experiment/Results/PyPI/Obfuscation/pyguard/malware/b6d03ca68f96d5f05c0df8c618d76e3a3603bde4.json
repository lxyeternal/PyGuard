      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the setup phase (package installation) is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables code execution without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask errors and avoid detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a setup script is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms."
