      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable names and performs network operations to download executable files from hardcoded, suspicious URLs hosted on Discord's CDN. It creates a hidden directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' in the Windows system drive, writes the downloaded executables there with obfuscated names, and then immediately executes these binaries without any user interaction or consent. The code suppresses errors silently, avoids logging or notification, and attempts to delete the directory afterward, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The use of a setup script to perform these actions during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector. The combination of downloading untrusted executables, writing them to a system directory, and executing them automatically is a classic hallmark of malware, likely intended for payload delivery or system compromise."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a hidden directory in the root of the C: drive named \"$Windows.~SXK\", which is suspicious and mimics Windows system folder naming conventions to evade detection. It then downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any validation or user consent. The downloaded file is saved as 'main.exe' in the current directory, then immediately renamed and moved into the hidden directory with a different name 'XMICNEI.exe'. Finally, the code executes this downloaded executable silently using os.startfile. This sequence of actions—creating a hidden system-like folder, downloading an executable from an untrusted external source, saving it in a suspicious location, and executing it without user interaction—is a classic pattern of malware delivery and execution. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or validation, indicating the code is designed to stealthily deploy and run potentially malicious payloads on the victim system."
