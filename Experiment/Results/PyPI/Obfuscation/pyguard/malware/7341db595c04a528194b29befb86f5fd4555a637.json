      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a classic technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspicious package metadata, but the key malicious indicator is the hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during module import or setup. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, including supply chain attacks and remote code execution, as it enables execution of arbitrary code without user consent or transparency."
