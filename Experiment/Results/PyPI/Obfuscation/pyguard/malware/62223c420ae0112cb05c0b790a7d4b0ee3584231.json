      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to perform unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. Specifically, during installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via multiple HTTP GET requests to suspicious, hardcoded external domains (e.g., 'j0j0.xyz'). Furthermore, it reads highly sensitive system files '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow'—which contain user account and password hash information—and uploads their raw contents via HTTP POST requests to attacker-controlled URLs without any user consent or notification. The obfuscated class and variable names, combined with the use of network communication during package installation, the targeting of critical system files, and the exfiltration of this data to suspicious external servers, are all hallmark indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential theft and supply chain attacks. This behavior is executed automatically during package installation, which is a known vector for malware to compromise systems stealthily."
