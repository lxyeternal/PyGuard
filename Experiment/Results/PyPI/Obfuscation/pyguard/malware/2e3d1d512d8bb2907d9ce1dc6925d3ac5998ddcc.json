      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess to run obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often used for executing payloads, downloading further malware, or performing unauthorized actions on the system. The rest of the code calls setup() from distutils.core, which appears benign, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution during import or setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
