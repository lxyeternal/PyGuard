      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system environment information including the hostname, the user's home directory, and the current working directory, then serializes this data to JSON and encodes it in base64. It then sends this encoded data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL ('https://pypi.org/reqs?d=' + encoded_data) with a forged Host header ('psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). This pattern of silently collecting environment data and exfiltrating it to an external server without user consent or notification is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated variable names and base64 encoding to hide the data being sent further supports this conclusion. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic justifying this data collection and transmission, and the endpoint and header manipulation suggest an attempt to evade detection or masquerade the request. Therefore, this code exhibits characteristics typical of information-stealing malware."
