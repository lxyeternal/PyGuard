      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username of the user running the install (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://9.30.214.68:9090) without any user consent or notification. The class and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. Executing network communication during package installation to exfiltrate system and user information is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. There is no legitimate reason for this data collection and exfiltration during install, and the use of a hardcoded external IP address strongly indicates malicious intent."
