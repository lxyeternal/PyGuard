      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed dynamically via exec, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and malicious intent. Upon decoding, the code imports modules to extract Chrome browser cookies (using browser_cookie3), collects a range of cookie data, and constructs a URL with this data encoded as query parameters. It then performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, obfuscated URL. Afterward, it writes the response content to an executable file with a randomized name and executes it via subprocess.Popen with shell=True in the directory of the saved file. This sequence of actions—stealthy extraction of browser cookies, encoding and exfiltration of sensitive data to a remote server, downloading and executing a remote payload without user consent or notification—is a classic pattern of credential-stealing malware combined with remote code execution. The use of base64 encoding to hide the code, dynamic execution, network communication to an attacker-controlled endpoint, and spawning of a downloaded executable all confirm malicious behavior."
