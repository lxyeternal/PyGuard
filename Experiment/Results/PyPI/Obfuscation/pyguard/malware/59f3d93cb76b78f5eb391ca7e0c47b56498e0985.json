      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute decrypted code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The code runs without user interaction or consent, hides its intent through obfuscation (random variable and class names, encrypted payload), and executes arbitrary code during installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The use of 'exec' on decrypted data, the presence of network-related imports, and execution triggered during package installation strongly indicate malicious intent."
