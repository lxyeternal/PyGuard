      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, but this part appears benign or a cover. The critical indicator is the subprocess call that runs an obfuscated PowerShell command silently, which is a strong hallmark of malicious behavior such as payload delivery, persistence, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
