      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware evasion tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or unnecessary runs. The use of subprocess to run an encoded PowerShell command in hidden mode without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to download, execute, or stage further payloads silently. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask errors and avoid detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
