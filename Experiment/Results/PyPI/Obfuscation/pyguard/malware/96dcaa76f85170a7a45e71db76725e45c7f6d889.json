      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded in the setuptools install command hook, which executes automatically during package installation on macOS systems (sys.platform == 'darwin'). It runs a base64-decoded shell command 'ioreg -k IOPatformUUID' to retrieve the system's platform UUID, extracts it via regex, and computes its SHA-256 hash. This hash is checked against a hardcoded list of allowed hashes. If the hash matches, the code proceeds to silently read two sensitive files from the user's home directory under the hidden path '.config/gcloud': 'application_default_credentials.json' and 'credentials.db'. It then sends the contents of these files via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded external server 'europe-west2-workload-422915.cloudfunctions.net' with a custom header containing the hashed UUID. The entire operation is done without user consent or notification, and the code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. This behavior is a classic example of credential theft and data exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, base64 encoding to hide commands and paths, network exfiltration of sensitive credential files, and execution triggered automatically during install all strongly indicate malicious intent."
