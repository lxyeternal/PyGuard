      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a base64-encoded shell command. This command initiates a reverse shell by connecting to a hardcoded remote host ('e6j4342057.zicp.fun') on port 26264, spawning a bash shell with redirected input/output over the network socket. The command is obfuscated by base64 encoding and immediately decoded and executed via os.system during package installation, without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern enabling remote code execution and unauthorized access to the victim system. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded suspicious domain, execution of shell commands during install, and reverse shell payload are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
