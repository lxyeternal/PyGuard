      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable names and base64-encoded data that is decoded and immediately executed via exec(), which is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads. The decoded payload imports 'os' and 'requests', performs a network GET request to a suspicious hardcoded URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/accounts/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe), and then calls subprocess with the downloaded content. The code also checks for the existence of a suspicious file ('hifromDreamyOak') and exits early if present, indicating evasion or persistence logic. The execution of remote code during the setuptools setup phase (installation) without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The combination of obfuscation, remote code retrieval, dynamic execution, and network communication to a non-standard URL strongly confirms malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or validation, writes it to a temporary file, and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware: automated retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote source. The use of obfuscated variable names and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user consent further indicate malicious intent. Executing a remote binary without verification can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, or payload delivery. Therefore, this code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior."
