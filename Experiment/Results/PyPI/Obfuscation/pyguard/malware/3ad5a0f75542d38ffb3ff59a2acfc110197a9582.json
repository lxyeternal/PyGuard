      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard, attacker-controlled domain 'cdf7ymt2vtc0000eer0gggz6haayyyyyf.oast.fun'. This behavior is a classic example of automated, silent data exfiltration during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a package installation script to silently collect and transmit such environment data to an unknown external server without user consent or notification. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
