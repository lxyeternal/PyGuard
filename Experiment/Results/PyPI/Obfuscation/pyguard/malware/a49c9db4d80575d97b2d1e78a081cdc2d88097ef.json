      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique in malware. This pattern—obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window during package setup—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which may be used to hide failures in malicious code execution. Overall, the presence of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
