      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encryption to hide the payload, and the execution of arbitrary code during package installation without user interaction or consent strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also restricts execution to Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is common in targeted malware. Overall, this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
