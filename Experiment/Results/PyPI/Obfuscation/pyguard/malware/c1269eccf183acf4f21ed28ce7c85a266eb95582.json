      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads to be executed on the victim system. Additionally, this execution happens automatically during the import/setup phase without any user interaction or notification, which is typical of malicious behavior. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspicious package metadata, which may be used as a cover or to facilitate a supply chain attack. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, combined with the lack of legitimate context or user consent, strongly indicates malicious intent."
