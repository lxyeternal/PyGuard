      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by the following: It defines a function that collects sensitive system information on macOS platforms, including the output of 'uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', and 'ifconfig' commands, which reveal system details, user identity, current directory, and network configuration. This information is serialized into JSON, then base64 encoded to obfuscate the data. Immediately after, the encoded data is printed and sent via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http:/81.70.191.194:14333/start/), which is an external server likely controlled by an attacker. This exfiltration occurs automatically during the package setup process without any user interaction or consent, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, execution of shell commands to gather environment data, encoding of sensitive information, and silent network transmission to a non-standard IP address are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code leverages the package installation process to perform unauthorized data collection and exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain compromise."
