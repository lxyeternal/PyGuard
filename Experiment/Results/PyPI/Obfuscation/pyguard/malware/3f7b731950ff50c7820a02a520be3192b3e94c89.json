      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('winsysupdate.exe') from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable to the current working directory and immediately executes it using os.system. This pattern—automated download and execution of a remote binary without validation or user notification—is a classic hallmark of malware. The code does not perform any integrity checks, user prompts, or sandboxing, and the executable is run directly, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system. Such behavior is strongly associated with malicious payload delivery, remote code execution, and potential system compromise."
