      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a malicious payload embedded in the setup script. After the legitimate-looking setuptools setup call, there is a try-except block that collects sensitive environment information: the current working directory's last path component, the current user's username, and the hostname. It then constructs a string from these values and applies a XOR-based obfuscation with a fixed key. This obfuscated data is base64-encoded and sent as part of an HTTP GET request to a remote server. The remote server's address is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, and the connection is made to a suspicious port (octal 017620 = decimal 7906). The code suppresses all exceptions silently, indicating an attempt to evade detection. This behavior—collecting system/user information, obfuscating it, and exfiltrating it to a hardcoded external server during package installation—is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware. The obfuscation, lack of user consent or notification, and network communication to a suspicious endpoint during installation strongly indicate malicious intent."
