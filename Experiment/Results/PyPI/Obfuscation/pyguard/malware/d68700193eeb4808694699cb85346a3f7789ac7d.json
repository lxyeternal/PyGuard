      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is not human-readable and is executed silently with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute PowerShell with encoded commands is a well-known hallmark of malware, often used to download, execute, or stage further malicious payloads without user consent or interaction. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these behaviors strongly indicate malicious intent."
