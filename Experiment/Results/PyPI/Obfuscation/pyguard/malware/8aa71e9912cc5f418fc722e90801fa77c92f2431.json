      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or unnecessary runs. The use of subprocess to run an encoded PowerShell command in hidden mode without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used to execute payloads, download further malware, or perform unauthorized actions stealthily. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation, a known malware distribution technique. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the critical malicious behavior is the hidden execution of the encoded PowerShell command. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
