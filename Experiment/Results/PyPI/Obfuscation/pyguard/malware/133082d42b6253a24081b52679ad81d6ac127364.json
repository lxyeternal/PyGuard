      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The setup call itself appears benign but is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, which may be used to hide malicious activity. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, triggered automatically without user consent, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, such as stealth execution, code obfuscation, and potential payload delivery or system compromise."
