      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by the following: It defines a function that collects sensitive system information on macOS platforms, including the output of 'uname -a' (system info), 'id' (user identity), 'pwd' (current directory), and 'ifconfig' (network interfaces). This information is aggregated into a dictionary, serialized to JSON, then base64-encoded. The encoded data is printed and then sent via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http:/81.70.191.194:14333/start/). This exfiltration of system and user environment data occurs automatically during the package setup process without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, direct execution of shell commands to gather environment data, base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, and network transmission to a non-standard IP address are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior aligns with known malware patterns involving environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. Therefore, the code is malicious."
