      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The command is base64-encoded and executed in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with hidden execution and lack of any user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which are hallmark signs of malicious activity."
