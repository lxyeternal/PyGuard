      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is executed at import time (not user-triggered), which is suspicious. The use of distutils setup with a suspicious package name and the try-except blocks suppressing errors further indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity during package installation or execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
