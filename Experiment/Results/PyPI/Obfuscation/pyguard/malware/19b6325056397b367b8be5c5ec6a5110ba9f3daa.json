      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and WindowStyle Hidden suppresses any visible window, a known stealth technique. This behavior is executed automatically during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on file existence, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with malware patterns such as stealthy payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation."
