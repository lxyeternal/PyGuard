      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains further malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing payloads, or performing system reconnaissance or data exfiltration. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating stealth. These behaviors align strongly with known malware patterns, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution of potentially harmful commands during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
