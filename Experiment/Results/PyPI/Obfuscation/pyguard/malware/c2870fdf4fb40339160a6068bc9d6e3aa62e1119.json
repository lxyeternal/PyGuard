      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command being executed. The PowerShell window is set to hidden, suppressing user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute an encoded PowerShell command in hidden mode is a well-known malware behavior pattern for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or payload delivery. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation without user consent. The try/except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these factors combined strongly indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
