      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a GitHub raw content URL hosting 'test.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable to a temporary file with an obfuscated name and immediately executes it using a shell command ('start' on Windows). This behavior is a classic pattern of malware that fetches and runs a potentially malicious payload on the victim's machine. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The code only runs on Windows platforms and quits otherwise, indicating targeted execution. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The combination of network retrieval of an executable, writing it to disk, and immediate execution without validation or user consent is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
