      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a reverse shell payload. Specifically, during installation, it constructs a shell command that creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (121.4.154.240) on port 4501, duplicates the socket file descriptors to standard input/output/error, disables shell history, and spawns an interactive bash shell. This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via a shell call. This behavior is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor technique, enabling an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim machine during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port, execution of arbitrary shell commands during install, and spawning of a reverse shell are all strong indicators of malicious intent and confirm this code is malicious."
