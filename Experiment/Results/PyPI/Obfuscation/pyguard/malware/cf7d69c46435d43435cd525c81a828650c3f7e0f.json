      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and WindowStyle Hidden, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized or malicious actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, given the use of obfuscated encoded commands and hidden execution. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
