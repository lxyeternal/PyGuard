      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It downloads a batch file from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://frvezdff.pythonanywhere.com/getrnr) and saves it to the APPDATA directory under the name 'bbb.bat'. It then attempts to copy this batch file into the Windows Startup folder to achieve persistence, ensuring the batch file runs on system startup without user consent. The batch file is executed silently using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, hiding its execution from the user. After a delay, the code forcibly restarts the system using 'shutdown /r /f', which is unusual and potentially disruptive behavior. The obfuscated variable names and the combination of network retrieval, file writing to sensitive system locations, silent execution, and forced reboot are classic hallmarks of malware, particularly supply chain or installation-time malware. There is no legitimate user interaction, notification, or validation of the downloaded content, and the code runs automatically during package setup, which is a known vector for malicious payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
