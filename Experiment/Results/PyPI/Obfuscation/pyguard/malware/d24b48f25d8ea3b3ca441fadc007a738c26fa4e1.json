      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to perform malicious actions. Specifically, during installation, it constructs and executes PowerShell commands to download an executable file named 'CBLines.exe' from a hardcoded external URL (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) into the current working directory. After verifying the download, it then executes this downloaded executable using PowerShell. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is fetched from an untrusted remote source and executed without user consent or validation during package installation. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code performs network activity, writes files to the local filesystem, and executes potentially untrusted binaries automatically on install, all of which are strong indicators of malicious intent."
