      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or consent, writes it to the current working directory as 'download.exe', and then immediately executes it using os.startfile. This sequence of downloading and executing a remote binary without validation or user notification is a classic hallmark of malware behavior. The obfuscated function and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or error handling, and the code performs potentially harmful actions silently. According to the provided knowledge points, such automated download and execution of untrusted code from a remote source is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
