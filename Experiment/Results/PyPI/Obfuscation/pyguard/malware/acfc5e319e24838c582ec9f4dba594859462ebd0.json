      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior as it hooks into the setuptools install command to execute code automatically during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it registers an atexit function that performs the following suspicious actions: it writes a file named 'bykotko.txt' with the content 'kotko' in the current directory, then collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current script directory (URL-encoded). This collected data is concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with obfuscated query parameters. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding for data exfiltration, automatic execution during install, and sending environment and network information to an attacker-controlled server are hallmark indicators of malicious activity, consistent with supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the behavior is hidden within the package installation process, making it a high-risk malicious payload."
