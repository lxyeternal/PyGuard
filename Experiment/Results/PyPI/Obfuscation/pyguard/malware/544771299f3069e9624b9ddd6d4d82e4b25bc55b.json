      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. Inside this class, it contains a large obfuscated string and a numeric key string. It performs a character-wise XOR deobfuscation of the string using the numeric key, then dynamically compiles and executes the resulting code via eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated payload is not statically visible and is executed without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of eval and compile on dynamically decoded data, especially in an install hook, is a critical risk indicator. The package name and metadata are suspicious and generic, further supporting the malicious nature. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior designed to execute hidden payloads during installation."
