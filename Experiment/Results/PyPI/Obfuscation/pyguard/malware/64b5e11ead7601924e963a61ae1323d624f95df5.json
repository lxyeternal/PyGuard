      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the executed command and runs it stealthily (hidden window). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of subprocess.Popen to launch PowerShell with encoded commands is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these factors combined strongly indicate malicious behavior."
