      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hijacks the setuptools installation process by subclassing the install command and executing code during package installation without user consent. It collects sensitive environment information including hostname, current working directory, username, and IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), and enumerates directories on common root paths (c:\\, d:\\, /, /home). It encodes this information in hex and constructs a suspicious domain name dynamically. Then it performs a DNS lookup on this constructed domain, likely as a beacon or to verify connectivity. Finally, it exfiltrates all collected data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded suspicious domain 'https://425a2.rt11.ml' without any user interaction or notification. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to evade detection. The combination of environment discovery, data encoding, and automated exfiltration during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setuptools install hook, and the presence of network communication to an attacker-controlled domain confirms malicious intent."
