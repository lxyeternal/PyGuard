      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides an install hook method. Inside this method, it constructs a shell command that creates a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (81.68.90.93) on port 4444. The shell command is obfuscated by base64 encoding and then decoded and executed via os.system with bash. This behavior is a classic reverse shell payload, enabling remote command execution on the victim machine without user consent. The execution occurs automatically during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation, hardcoded attacker-controlled IP and port, and immediate execution of a reverse shell command during install time are strong indicators of malicious intent."
