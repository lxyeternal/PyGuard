      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute decrypted code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The code runs without user interaction or consent during installation, which is suspicious. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution of decrypted code during installation strongly indicate malicious intent. The setup call installs this malicious install command hook, ensuring the payload runs automatically when the package is installed. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, execution during package installation, and use of encrypted payloads. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
