      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command being executed. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a stealth or persistence check. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution of encoded PowerShell commands are classic hallmarks of malware, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign but is likely a cover or delivery mechanism. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
