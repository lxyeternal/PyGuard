      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is designed to run silently (WindowStyle Hidden) without user interaction or notification. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute PowerShell with an encoded command is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then runs this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or target specific environments. The presence of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with hidden process execution and lack of any legitimate user interaction or business logic strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the code invoking distutils.setup appears benign but is likely a cover or part of the malicious package installation process. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup."
