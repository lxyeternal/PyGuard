      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the subprocess is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, both of which are stealth techniques to avoid user awareness. The encoded command likely contains instructions to invoke a web request or execute further payloads, as suggested by the presence of 'Invoke-WebRequest' and output redirection in the decoded command string. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These factors combined—obfuscated PowerShell command execution in hidden mode, conditional execution based on file system state, and embedding in a setup script—are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with malware techniques such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or persistence establishment."
