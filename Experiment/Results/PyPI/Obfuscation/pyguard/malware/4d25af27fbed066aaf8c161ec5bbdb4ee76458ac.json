      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable names and hardcoded Discord webhook URLs to exfiltrate data. The function QUuHNQQmQllxXzWLISrINrCPEVaVCBYG scans local storage directories of Discord and various browsers for files ending with .log or .ldb, which are known to potentially contain Discord tokens. It uses regex patterns to extract Discord authentication tokens from these files. The function jhNAAXwEzZRWVcsqbfsRcFcWBlCzJFIq collects environment variables to locate application data folders, searches for tokens, and then sends the collected tokens to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks without any user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic example of credential theft and data exfiltration malware. The code runs automatically upon import or installation (e.g., in setup), which is a common supply chain attack vector. The presence of obfuscation, hardcoded attacker-controlled endpoints, automated scanning of sensitive user data, and silent exfiltration confirms the code is malicious."
