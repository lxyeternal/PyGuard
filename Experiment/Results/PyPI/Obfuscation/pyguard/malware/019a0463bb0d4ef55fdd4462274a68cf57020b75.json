      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to execute payloads, download additional malware, or perform system compromise without user knowledge. Additionally, the presence of a setup() call with a suspicious package name and version, wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, is consistent with attempts to hide malicious installation behavior. Overall, the combination of obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious setup invocation strongly indicates malicious behavior."
