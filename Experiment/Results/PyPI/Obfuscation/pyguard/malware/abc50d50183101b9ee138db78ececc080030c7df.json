      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using hex-encoded strings and dynamic evaluation (eval) of decoded strings, which is a common technique used to hide malicious intent. It dynamically imports critical functions like eval, compile, exec, base64 decoding, and string encoding/decoding, then uses these to decode and execute further code. The code includes multiple layers of decoding and decompressing data, followed by execution of the resulting code, which is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis. The obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden payloads. The code also appears to decode and execute base64-encoded and possibly compressed data, which is typical for payload delivery or data exfiltration. There is no legitimate user interaction or benign context visible, and the code uses eval and exec on dynamically decoded data, which is a critical risk indicator. Based on the extensive use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and decoding of encoded payloads, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL to which it sends a notification message indicating that a package has been installed. This behavior is suspicious because it silently sends information about the installed package to an external, attacker-controlled server without user consent or notification. The function name and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The code performs an HTTP POST request automatically, likely during installation or setup, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this network communication. Such automated exfiltration of installation events to a hardcoded external webhook is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques such as hex-encoded strings, dynamic evaluation via eval, and base64 decoding combined with zlib decompression to hide its true intent. The code dynamically imports critical functions like eval, compile, exec, base64 decoding, and string operations in an obfuscated manner. It defines functions that decode and decompress data, then immediately execute it, which is a classic pattern for executing hidden payloads. The code also appears to decode a large base64-encoded and compressed payload and executes it dynamically, which is a hallmark of malware delivering and running concealed malicious code. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the obfuscation is designed to evade detection. Such patterns are strongly associated with malware, including remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."

This behavior is consistent with data exfiltration or unauthorized notification to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The webhook URL is hardcoded and external, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially since it occurs automatically without user interaction or consent. The code does not perform any legitimate user-facing functionality and silently sends information about the installed package to a remote server, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in installation scripts."
