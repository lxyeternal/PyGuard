      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the run() method. Inside this method, it contains a large obfuscated string and a numeric string, which are used in a loop to XOR-decode the obfuscated string into executable Python code. This decoded code is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). The use of obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution (eval and compile) during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of hidden payloads without user consent or visibility. The obfuscated payload is not statically visible and is decoded at runtime, which is a common malware technique to evade detection. The code runs this payload during the install phase of the package, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscation and dynamic execution in a simple setup script. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
