      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It programmatically extracts Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from various browsers using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects detailed user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, and profile data via the robloxpy API. The script then exfiltrates this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie and the user's IP address, to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. The variable and function names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. There is no user interaction or notification, and the data collection and exfiltration happen automatically. This behavior aligns with credential-stealing malware patterns, specifically targeting Roblox accounts by stealing session cookies and sending them to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, automated cookie extraction from browsers, and immediate data exfiltration without user consent confirms the code is malicious."
