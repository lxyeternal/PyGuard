      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute arbitrary decrypted code during package installation. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload and immediately executes it with exec(). This occurs silently during the install phase without user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The code also restricts this behavior to Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), indicating targeted malicious intent. The setup call installs this custom install command, ensuring the malicious payload runs automatically when the package is installed. This pattern is strongly associated with malware that delivers and executes hidden payloads during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential further compromise."
