      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string using subprocess.Popen. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is not directly visible, indicating obfuscation to hide its true intent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess to run an encoded PowerShell command in hidden mode is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly seen in malware for executing payloads, persistence, or downloading further malicious components. Additionally, this execution occurs outside of any user interaction or legitimate setup logic, and the setup() call is wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, which may be an attempt to hide malicious activity during package installation. These factors combined align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and abuse of installation scripts for unauthorized code execution."
