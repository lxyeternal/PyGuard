      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encryption to hide the payload, and the execution of decrypted code during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code attempts to run arbitrary code on the user's system during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
