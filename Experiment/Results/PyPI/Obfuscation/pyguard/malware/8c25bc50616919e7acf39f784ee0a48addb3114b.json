      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of this obfuscated PowerShell invocation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware to stealthily execute arbitrary or harmful commands. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a rudimentary evasion or staging check. The subsequent call to setup() with a suspicious package name and version appears to be a decoy or an attempt to disguise the malicious payload within a package installation context, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
