      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is designed to run silently (WindowStyle Hidden) without user interaction or notification. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute a PowerShell command in hidden mode with an encoded payload is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious code. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, which is typical in supply chain attacks where malicious code is embedded in package installation scripts. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and suspicious setup invocation strongly indicates malicious intent."
