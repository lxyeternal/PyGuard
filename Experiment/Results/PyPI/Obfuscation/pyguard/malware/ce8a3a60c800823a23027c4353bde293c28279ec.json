      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads three executable files from a hardcoded local HTTP server (http://127.0.0.1:5000) and writes them to the Windows Temp directory without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes one of these downloaded executables (Alistener.exe) in a hidden window (creationflags=8). This behavior is triggered automatically during the package installation process (when the script is run with the 'install' argument), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The function and variable names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The combination of network retrieval of executables, writing to system temporary directories, and silent execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent, such as deploying backdoors, remote shells, or other malware payloads. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, especially contacting a local or remote server to download and run executables without user consent or validation."
