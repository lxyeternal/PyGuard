      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of obfuscation, hidden process execution, and execution during setup without user interaction or consent aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealthy code execution, potential payload delivery, and evasion techniques."
