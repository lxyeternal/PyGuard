      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user data from the Telegram Desktop application's 'tdata' directory located in the APPDATA environment path, which contains user session and credential data. It archives this data into an in-memory ZIP file and then exfiltrates it by sending an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Telegram Bot API endpoint, uploading the ZIP file as a document to a specific chat ID. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration without user consent. Additionally, the code is embedded within a setuptools setup script, which suggests it may execute during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of hardcoded bot tokens and chat IDs for data exfiltration, combined with the targeting of sensitive application data, is a strong indicator of malicious intent consistent with credential-stealing malware."
