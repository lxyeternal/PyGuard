      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It is a setup script that, during installation on Windows systems, decodes a large base64-encoded payload and executes it using exec. This payload is obfuscated and likely contains further malicious code. The script uses subprocess to run a base64-decoded PowerShell command in hidden mode, which is a common technique for stealthy execution of malicious commands. The code also performs environment checks and exits if certain conditions are not met, indicating anti-analysis or evasion behavior. The use of a random-looking package name, base64 obfuscation, execution of decoded code during installation, and spawning of hidden PowerShell processes are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack or malware. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code is designed to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise."
