      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and immediately executed using builtins.exec and builtins.compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling and system execution, then writes and executes code fetched from a suspicious hardcoded URL (http://20.224.2.213/inject/ctE6toLDoHBBjApi). This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs remote code without user consent. The execution occurs during the package setup phase, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The package name and metadata appear suspicious and unrelated to legitimate software. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic code execution, and network retrieval of code during installation, combined with no user interaction or validation, confirms this code is malicious."
