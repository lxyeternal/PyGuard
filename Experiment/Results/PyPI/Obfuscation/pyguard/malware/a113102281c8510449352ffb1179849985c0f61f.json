      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes during package installation. It retrieves the current Windows user login name and creates directories inside the user's Start Menu Programs folder, specifically under 'Startup\\boot' and 'Powerpoint'. It then uses the gitpython library to clone two GitHub repositories ('https://github.com/dcsage/test2lmaos.git' and 'https://github.com/dcsage/defonotagrabber.git') into these directories. After cloning, it renames a 'test.py' file from the cloned 'test2lmaos' repository into the user's Startup folder. This behavior effectively downloads and stages potentially untrusted code into startup locations, enabling persistence by running code automatically when the user logs in. The code runs automatically during package installation without user consent or notification, uses obfuscated variable and class names, and performs network operations to fetch and deploy external code. These are classic hallmarks of a supply chain attack and malicious payload delivery. The use of the Windows Startup folder for persistence, cloning of external repositories, and automatic file manipulation during install time strongly indicate malicious intent."
