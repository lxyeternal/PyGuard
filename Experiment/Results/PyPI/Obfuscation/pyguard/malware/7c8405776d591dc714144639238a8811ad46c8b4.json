      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware evasion technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to run an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
