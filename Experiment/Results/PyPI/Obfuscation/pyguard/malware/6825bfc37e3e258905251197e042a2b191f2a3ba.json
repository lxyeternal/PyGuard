      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function rn() that immediately executes a system shutdown command upon running. It checks the operating system and issues 'poweroff' on Linux or macOS, and 'shutdown /s -f -t 0' on other systems (likely Windows). This causes an immediate forced shutdown of the user's machine without any user interaction or consent. The function rn() is called at the top level, so this destructive action occurs automatically when the script is run or the package is installed. This behavior is highly suspicious and malicious because it forcibly powers off the system, disrupting normal operation and potentially causing data loss. Additionally, the package name 'n0kw6ymes2hjnfi5' appears random and suspicious, which is a common trait in malicious or typosquatted packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the shutdown command is executed immediately during setup. This pattern aligns with critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, specifically destructive payload execution triggered during package installation or execution."
