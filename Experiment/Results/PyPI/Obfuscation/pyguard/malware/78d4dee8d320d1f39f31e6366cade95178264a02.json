      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The code uses obfuscated variable and class names, imports network-related modules, and executes hidden code without user interaction or consent. The presence of encrypted code executed at install time, combined with obfuscation and network module imports, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
