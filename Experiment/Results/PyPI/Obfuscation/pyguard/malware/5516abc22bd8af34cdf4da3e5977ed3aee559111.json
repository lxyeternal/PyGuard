      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a function (KfnAlmHeICsZHjcHbDjNmEFYTUHPDqeK) during package installation. This function reads the system uptime from '/proc/uptime', collects detailed system information including OS release, system name, version, platform, and the local IP address. It then constructs a string combining this information and opens a raw TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090, sending the collected system information without any user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, execution of code during package installation, silent collection of sensitive system information, and exfiltration to a hardcoded external server are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware that leverages Python package installation hooks to perform unauthorized data collection and exfiltration."
