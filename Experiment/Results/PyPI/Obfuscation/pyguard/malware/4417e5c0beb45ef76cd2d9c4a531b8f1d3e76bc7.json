      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is highly obfuscated and uses base64 decoding combined with exec to execute hidden code. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true functionality of the code. The code imports base64 and immediately decodes a large base64-encoded string, then executes it without any validation or user interaction. Such behavior is typical of malware that attempts to conceal its payload and evade detection. The extensive obfuscation and direct execution of decoded data strongly suggest that the code is designed to perform unauthorized or harmful actions, such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or system compromise."
