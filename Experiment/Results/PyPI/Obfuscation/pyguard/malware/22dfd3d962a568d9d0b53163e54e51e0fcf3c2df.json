      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated function and variable names to evade detection. It decodes a base64-encoded URL that points to a suspicious external domain (https://hooks.slack.com/services/...), which is a known pattern for exfiltrating data to attacker-controlled endpoints. The code collects sensitive environment information including the stack trace, environment variables, system uname information, and the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://ipinfo.io/ip'. It then packages this information as JSON and sends it via an HTTP POST request to the decoded URL without any user consent or notification. The code also contains anti-analysis checks to avoid running on certain hostnames or filenames commonly used in analysis environments. Finally, it forcibly exits the program after sending the data, which is typical for malware to evade further detection or analysis. These behaviors—environment reconnaissance, data exfiltration to a hardcoded suspicious URL, obfuscation, and anti-analysis checks—are hallmark traits of malicious code, specifically information-stealing malware."
