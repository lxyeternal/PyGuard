      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression (base64, zlib) combined with dynamic execution functions such as eval and exec. It constructs and executes code dynamically from decompressed and decoded data, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The code includes a large obfuscated numeric string that is processed into executable code at runtime, indicating an attempt to hide its true functionality. The use of eval on dynamically generated code, especially after decompression and base64 decoding, is a strong indicator of malware, as it allows execution of arbitrary code that is not visible in the source. The code also uses lambda functions and confusing variable names to evade analysis. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic, and the code appears designed to execute hidden payloads. According to the provided knowledge points, such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are strong indicators of malicious intent, including potential remote code execution, payload delivery, or data exfiltration."
