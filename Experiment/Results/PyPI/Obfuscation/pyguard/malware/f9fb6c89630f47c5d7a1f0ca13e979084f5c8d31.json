      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that registers an atexit function to run after installation. This function writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with the content 'proof bug by kotko' in the current directory, which is suspicious as it writes a file without user consent or clear purpose. It then collects sensitive environment information: the public IP address of the host (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current script directory (URL-encoded). This information is concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with obfuscated query parameters. The obfuscation of variable names, the use of base64 encoding to hide the data being exfiltrated, and the automatic execution of this data collection and exfiltration during package installation (without user interaction or notification) are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation to silently collect and exfiltrate system information. There is no legitimate reason for this behavior in a standard setuptools setup script, and the external domain is not a known trusted endpoint. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior related to unauthorized data collection and exfiltration during package installation."
