      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code is wrapped in try/except blocks that suppress errors, which is typical for malware to evade detection. The setup call with a suspicious package name and no legitimate business logic further supports the likelihood of a supply chain attack or malicious package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and silent error handling strongly indicates malicious behavior."
