      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during installation, constructs a URL from obfuscated variable names and attempts to download a Python script named 'qrcodegen.py' from a remote source. It then writes this script to the current working directory and immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation without user consent or validation. The obfuscation of variable names and URL components further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The downloaded script is executed without any integrity checks or user interaction, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. Such a pattern is strongly associated with malicious activity, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise."
