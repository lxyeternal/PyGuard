      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the presence of an encoded PowerShell command executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask errors and avoid raising suspicion. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate that the code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthy execution of hidden PowerShell commands, likely for payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation."
