      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string using subprocess.Popen. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden -EncodedCommand' is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The subprocess is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, further hiding the process window from the user. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it involves obfuscated code execution without user interaction or notification. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
