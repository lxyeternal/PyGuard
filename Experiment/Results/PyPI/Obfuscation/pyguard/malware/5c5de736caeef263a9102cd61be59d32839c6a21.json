      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup process that uses PowerShell to download an executable file from a remote Dropbox URL and then immediately executes it. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malicious activity, specifically a supply chain attack or remote code execution. The code downloads an untrusted binary ('Oxzy.exe') to a suspicious location ('~/WindowsCache.exe') without any user interaction or consent, and then runs it directly. This sequence is strongly associated with malware because it automates retrieval and execution of potentially harmful code from an external source during installation, which is a high-risk vector for system compromise. The use of os.system to spawn PowerShell for downloading and executing a remote executable, combined with the lack of validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic, confirms the malicious intent."
