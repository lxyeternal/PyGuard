      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (via os.getcwd()), and the username of the current user (via getpass.getuser()). It then sends this collected information as a dictionary in an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://1y05ug5pi97xa0bk2bjhdwp5yw4nsdg2.oastify.com). This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration malware that silently collects and transmits system and user information without user consent or notification. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. Executing such code automatically during package installation (via setuptools install hook) is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for a package installer to send environment details to an unknown external server, making this a strong indicator of malicious intent."
