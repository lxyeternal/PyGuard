      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a credential-stealing malware targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive user data. It collects tokens from various browsers and Discord clients by accessing local files and decrypting stored credentials using Windows APIs. It exfiltrates this stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without user consent. The code also searches user directories for files containing keywords related to accounts, passwords, and wallets, uploads them to anonymous file hosting services, and sends links to the attacker. It uses threading to perform these actions stealthily and includes obfuscation techniques such as base64 decoding and encrypted payload decryption. The presence of hardcoded attacker-controlled webhook URLs, automated data collection and exfiltration, use of Windows cryptographic APIs to decrypt stored secrets, and execution of these actions during package setup confirm malicious intent. This code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including credential theft, data exfiltration, and stealthy execution."
