      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or detected runs. The use of subprocess.Popen to run an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to download, execute, or stage further payloads without user consent or visibility. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
