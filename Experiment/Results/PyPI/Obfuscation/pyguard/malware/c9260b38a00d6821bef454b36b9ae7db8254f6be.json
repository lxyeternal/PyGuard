      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques such as extensive use of eval with encoded strings, base64 decoding, and dynamic execution of decoded data. The code imports critical functions dynamically and decodes a large base64-encoded payload which is then decompressed and executed at runtime. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware that conceals its true intent and payload to evade detection. The obfuscated variable and function names, combined with the execution of decoded and decompressed code, strongly suggest that the script is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads. The absence of any legitimate user interaction or benign context, and the use of eval on dynamically decoded data, further confirm the malicious nature. Such behavior is typical of supply chain attacks, remote code execution, or information-stealing malware."
