      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large base64-encoded payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of cryptographic decryption to hide the payload, and the execution of arbitrary code during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism. There is no legitimate business logic or user consent involved, and the code attempts to run hidden malicious code on Windows systems during package installation."
