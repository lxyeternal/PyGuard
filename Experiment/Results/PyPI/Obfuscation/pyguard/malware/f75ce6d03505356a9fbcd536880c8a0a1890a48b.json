      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior. It collects detailed environment information including the hostname and all environment variables, then encodes this data by percent-encoding non-alphanumeric characters. It establishes a socket connection to an external, hardcoded domain ('packageman.comlu.com') on port 80 and sends this encoded environment data via an HTTP POST request without any user consent or notification. This behavior is indicative of unauthorized data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable names and the execution of network communication during the setup phase (package installation) strongly suggest a supply chain attack vector. Such automatic, silent collection and transmission of sensitive system information to a suspicious external server is a hallmark of malware and credential-stealing tools."
