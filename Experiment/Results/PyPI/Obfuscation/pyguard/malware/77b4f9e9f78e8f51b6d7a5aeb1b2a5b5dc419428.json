      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. Inside this class, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules only if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'). It then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a Fernet key and immediately executes the decrypted code with exec(). This decrypted code is not visible in the source, indicating obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Executing decrypted code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscation of variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and the execution of arbitrary code during installation without user consent or interaction strongly indicate malicious intent. The setup call installs this custom install command, ensuring the malicious payload runs automatically when the package is installed. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving code execution during package installation, obfuscation, and dynamic payload delivery."
