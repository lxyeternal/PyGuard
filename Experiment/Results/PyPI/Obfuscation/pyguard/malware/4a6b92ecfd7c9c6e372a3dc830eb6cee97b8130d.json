      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The obfuscated parameter name 'fggPNeFWCnUCjxDbCpsigIwovhtbTlyX' set to False is suspicious and likely an attempt to evade detection or analysis. The rest of the setup call appears benign but is likely a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
