      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. It uses obfuscated variable and function names to hide intent. During the package installation (in the custom install class), it enumerates files in the user's home directory under a hidden '.local/bin' path and performs a cryptographic check against a hardcoded hash. Upon a successful match, it downloads a payload from a remote URL that is dynamically constructed and obfuscated via XOR operations. The downloaded content is then XOR-decoded with a generated keystream and written as an executable file named 'report_gen' in the user's local bin directory. The code then sets executable permissions and silently launches this binary as a subprocess with output suppressed. This sequence of downloading, decoding, writing, and executing a remote payload during package installation without user consent is a hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. The use of cryptographic hashing and layered XOR obfuscation further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The network activity contacting attacker-controlled URLs combined with silent execution of arbitrary code strongly confirms malicious intent."
