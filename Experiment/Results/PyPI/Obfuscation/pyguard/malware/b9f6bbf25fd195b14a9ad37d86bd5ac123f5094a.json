      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class that overrides the install method to execute a function during package installation. This function reads the system uptime from '/proc/uptime', collects detailed system information including OS release, system name, version, platform, and the local IP address. It then constructs a string combining this information and opens a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090, sending the collected system information without any user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, execution of code during package installation, and silent exfiltration of system information to a suspicious hardcoded IP address are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known supply chain attack techniques where malicious code is executed during package installation to collect and exfiltrate sensitive environment data. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the code attempts to stealthily gather and transmit system details, which is a hallmark of malware."
