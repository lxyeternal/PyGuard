      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window style), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or obvious detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with an encoded command, combined with the suppression of output and lack of user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and execution during setup without user consent or transparency are all critical risk indicators of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
