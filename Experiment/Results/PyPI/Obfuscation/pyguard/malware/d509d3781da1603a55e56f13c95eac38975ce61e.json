      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that is decoded and immediately executed as a shell command during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall.run method). This command installs the 'requests' and 'type' packages, then echoes and imports modules, and crucially performs a GET request to a suspicious GitHub URL (https://github.com/Exet75/neofetch/blob/main/ip_checker.exe?raw=true). The content fetched from this URL is written to a file named 'C:\\Program Files\\STEALER.exe' and then executed. This sequence is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is executed during package installation without user consent. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the shell command, the download and execution of an executable named 'STEALER.exe' in a system directory, and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification strongly indicate malicious intent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as code execution during install, obfuscated commands, downloading and running external payloads, and targeting system directories for payload deployment."
