      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, and other credentials from various browsers and applications by accessing local storage, decrypting encrypted data using Windows APIs, and reading application-specific files. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to evade detection. It exfiltrates stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, sending detailed user information including IP address, username, badges, billing info, and friends list without user consent. The code also attempts to install required dependencies silently, uses threading to perform background data collection and exfiltration, and kills processes to access locked files. It writes stolen data to temporary files and uploads them to external file hosting services. The presence of Windows API calls for decrypting Chrome data, combined with network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints, and the overall structure targeting multiple browsers and wallets, confirms this is a malicious credential stealer designed to silently harvest and exfiltrate sensitive user information. This behavior matches numerous critical risk indicators for malware, including environment discovery, data collection, obfuscation, and automated exfiltration without user interaction."
