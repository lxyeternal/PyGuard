      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during the installation process, opens a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (85.159.212.47) on port 61985. It then redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket and spawns a pseudo-terminal shell (/bin/sh). This effectively creates a reverse shell back to the attacker's server, allowing remote command execution on the victim's machine. The obfuscated class and variable names, the execution of a shell during package installation without user interaction or consent, and the hardcoded external IP address are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern is a classic example of a supply chain attack where malicious code is executed during package installation to gain unauthorized remote access."
