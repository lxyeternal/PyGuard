      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 decoding combined with marshal.loads to dynamically reconstruct and execute Python bytecode via exec. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the code. The presence of such obfuscated and dynamically executed payloads is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The decoded payload likely contains further code that performs unauthorized or harmful actions. The use of marshal and base64 to hide executable code, followed immediately by exec, is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade static detection. Given the extensive knowledge points, this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
