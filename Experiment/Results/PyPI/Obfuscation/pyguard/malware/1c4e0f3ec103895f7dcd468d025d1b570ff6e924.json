      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes during package installation. It performs the following suspicious and malicious actions: 1) It retrieves the current Windows user login name and constructs paths inside the user's Start Menu Programs directory, specifically under 'Startup\\boot' and 'Powerpoint'. 2) It creates these directories if they do not exist, which are known persistence locations on Windows. 3) It uses the 'git' Python module to clone two GitHub repositories ('https://github.com/dcsage/test2lmaos.git' and 'https://github.com/dcsage/defonotagrabber.git') into these directories. 4) It renames a 'test.py' script from the cloned 'test2lmaos' repository into the user's Startup folder, which will cause it to run on user login, establishing persistence. 5) It then starts an executable 'main.exe' from the 'defonotagrabber' repository inside the 'Powerpoint' folder, which is likely a malicious payload. 6) All these actions happen silently during package installation without user consent or notification. 7) The obfuscated class and method names, combined with cloning and executing code from untrusted external sources, are classic indicators of a supply chain attack and remote code execution. This behavior is strongly associated with malware that establishes persistence, downloads and executes secondary payloads, and compromises the victim system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
