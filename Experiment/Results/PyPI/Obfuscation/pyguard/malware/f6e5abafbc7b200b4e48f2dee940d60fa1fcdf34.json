      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It uses dynamic attribute access and string construction to evade static analysis. The code conditionally imports modules like 'pip' and 'win32com', attempts to create and write files in user directories, and uses Windows COM interfaces to create and save shortcuts. It performs directory walking and file operations targeting specific file extensions, likely to propagate or execute payloads. The code also checks for administrative privileges and uses Windows-specific APIs, indicating attempts at privilege escalation or persistence. The obfuscation, combined with the use of setup() from distutils.core and execution of code during installation, is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The code's behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including environment discovery, file system manipulation, dynamic code execution, and potential payload deployment. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
