      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in supply chain attacks. The code executes arbitrary, hidden code during package installation without user consent or interaction, which can lead to remote code execution, system compromise, or further payload delivery. The obfuscated variable names, the use of encryption to hide the payload, and the execution of decrypted code during installation strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only to facilitate this hidden payload execution. This behavior is consistent with known malware patterns that hijack Python package installation to run unauthorized code."
