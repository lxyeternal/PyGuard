      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and executes the decoded content immediately via exec. This is a classic technique used to hide malicious payloads. The decoded payload itself is extremely large and appears to contain multiple layers of obfuscation and encoded data, which is typical of malware attempting to evade detection. The use of exec on base64-decoded data without any validation or user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such behavior is commonly associated with malware that downloads, decrypts, and executes payloads dynamically, often for purposes such as credential theft, remote code execution, or system compromise. Given the extensive obfuscation, immediate execution of decoded code, and lack of any benign context or user consent, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
