      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It performs an HTTP GET request to a legitimate site (baidu.com) but more critically, it defines and executes a shell command via subprocess.run with shell=True that uses curl to send a POST request to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://43.139.166.32:8080). The POST request headers and data exfiltrate sensitive system information including hostname, current user, present working directory, directory listing, security groups, user directory contents, contents of /etc/passwd, installed NPM modules, and bash history. This is done silently without any user interaction or consent. The code is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which means this malicious data exfiltration could be triggered during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The variable and function names are obfuscated and meaningless, which is typical of malware trying to evade detection. The combination of environment discovery, sensitive data collection, and automated exfiltration to a hardcoded external server without user knowledge or legitimate purpose is a hallmark of malicious credential-stealing or information-stealing malware."
