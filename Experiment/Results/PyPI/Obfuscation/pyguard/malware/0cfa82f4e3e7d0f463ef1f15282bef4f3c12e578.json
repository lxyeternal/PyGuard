      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (WindowStyle Hidden) without user interaction or notification. The subprocess is created with the flag CREATE_NO_WINDOW to avoid showing any window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden shell process, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a known technique for executing arbitrary or harmful code covertly. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The setup call itself appears benign but is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, all of which strongly indicate malicious behavior."
