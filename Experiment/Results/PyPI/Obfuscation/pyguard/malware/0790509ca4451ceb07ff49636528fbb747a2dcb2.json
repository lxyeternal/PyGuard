      "malicious_behavior": "The code is malicious because it hijacks the Python package installation process by overriding setuptools 'develop' and 'install' commands to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it defines a function 'ElVYJWBWJJOalhlSZIzprwvUqNUzUHOn' that downloads an executable file named 'Cleaner.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://a4a08d21-3950-435e-8b39-12ab7788cd10.id.repl.co/Cleaner.exe') without any user consent or validation. After downloading, it writes the executable to the current directory and immediately executes it using a shell command with environment variable manipulation ('set __COMPACT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker | start Cleaner.exe'). This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery during package installation. The use of obfuscated variable and function names, absence of user interaction, and execution of a remote binary strongly indicate malicious intent. Such code can lead to system compromise, unauthorized code execution, and potential data theft or further malware deployment."
