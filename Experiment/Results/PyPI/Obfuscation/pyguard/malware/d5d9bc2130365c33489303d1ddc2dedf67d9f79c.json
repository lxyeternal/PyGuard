      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a large obfuscated string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and a numeric string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp'. It uses a loop to XOR each character of the obfuscated string with a character from the numeric string (used as a key), producing a decoded string. This decoded string is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(..., 'exec')). The use of obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution (eval on decoded data) is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such patterns are typical in malware to hide the true payload and evade static detection. The code does not perform any user interaction or validation before executing the decoded payload, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior. Given the extensive obfuscation and immediate execution of decoded code, this script is almost certainly malicious."
