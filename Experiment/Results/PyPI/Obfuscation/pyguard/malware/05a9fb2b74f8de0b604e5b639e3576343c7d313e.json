      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window style), which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with encoded commands, combined with the suppression of exceptions and lack of user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and abuse of installation hooks for unauthorized code execution."
