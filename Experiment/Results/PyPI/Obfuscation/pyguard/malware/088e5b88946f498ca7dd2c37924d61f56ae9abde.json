      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The PowerShell is launched with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess to execute an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but wrapped in a try-except block, likely to suppress errors and avoid detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
