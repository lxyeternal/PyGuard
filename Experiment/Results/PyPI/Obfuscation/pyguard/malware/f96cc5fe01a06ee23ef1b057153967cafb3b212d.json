      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the code attempts to run a standard setup() call but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, possibly to avoid raising suspicion. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
