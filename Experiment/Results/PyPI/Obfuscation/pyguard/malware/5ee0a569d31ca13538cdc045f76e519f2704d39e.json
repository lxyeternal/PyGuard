      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive user data, specifically Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, retrieves detailed user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, and creation date via Roblox APIs. The script sends all this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie and the user's IP address, to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating credentials and personal data to an attacker-controlled server. The variable and function names are obfuscated, and there is no user interaction or notification about this data collection and transmission. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including unauthorized credential theft, data exfiltration to hardcoded external endpoints, use of obfuscated code, and lack of user consent or legitimate purpose. Therefore, this code is malicious."
