      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag and WindowStyle Hidden, indicating an attempt to run stealthily without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often used for downloading, executing further payloads, or performing unauthorized actions on the victim system. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in try/except, which appears benign but is likely a decoy or to blend in as a legitimate package. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden process without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malware."
