      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via http://ip.42.pl/raw), the current username (getpass.getuser()), the hostname (socket.gethostname()), the current timestamp, the current script directory, and the contents of /etc/hosts. It then concatenates all this data into a single string, encodes it as hex, splits it into chunks, and sends each chunk as a DNS A record query to a dynamically constructed subdomain under a suspicious domain ('.<random8chars>.b0a0374cd1cb4305002e.d.requestbin.net'). This behavior is a classic data exfiltration technique using DNS queries to evade detection. The obfuscated variable names, the use of DNS queries for data exfiltration, and the automatic execution of this code during package setup (via setuptools.setup call) strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code silently leaks sensitive system and user information to an attacker-controlled domain during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses Selenium WebDriver in headless mode to open a specific URL (https://requestbin.net/dns?master=b0a0374cd1cb4305002e), waits 5 seconds, then extracts text from an element with class name 'list-group'. It applies multiple regex substitutions to clean the text, then interprets the cleaned string as a hex-encoded bytearray, decodes it to a string, and prints the result. There is no evidence of executing the decoded string as code, no file writing or deletion, no subprocess or shell command execution, no network communication beyond the initial GET request, and no obfuscation beyond simple regex cleaning and hex decoding. The URL used is a public request bin service often used for testing HTTP requests, not a suspicious or attacker-controlled domain. The variable names are obfuscated but this alone is not sufficient to classify as malicious. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, credential theft, or remote code execution. Overall, the behavior is consistent with a benign script that fetches and decodes data from a web page for display or analysis purposes."
