      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains further malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing payloads, or performing system reconnaissance or data exfiltration. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors and avoids raising suspicion. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
