      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to run stealthily without user notification. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of Base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden shell process, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The obfuscation and stealth execution pattern, without any legitimate user interaction or notification, aligns with typical malware behavior such as payload delivery, persistence, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
