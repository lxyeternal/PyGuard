      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It automatically installs a third-party package (gitpython) without user consent, then clones a GitHub repository ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') into a hardcoded system path ('C:\\Users\\repo'). After cloning, it changes the working directory to this path and executes a script named 'bypass.py' from the cloned repository using a subprocess call. This sequence effectively downloads and runs potentially untrusted code from a remote source without any validation, user interaction, or notification. The execution occurs automatically when the script runs (including during package setup), which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess to run external code from a remote repository, combined with the silent installation of dependencies and hardcoded system paths, strongly suggests intent to execute unauthorized or harmful payloads. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as remote code execution, supply chain compromise, and unauthorized payload delivery."
