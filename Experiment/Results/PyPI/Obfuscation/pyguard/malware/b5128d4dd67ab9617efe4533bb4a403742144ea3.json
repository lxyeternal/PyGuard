      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using escaped character sequences and base64 encoding, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. It uses eval to dynamically evaluate strings, including the import of modules and execution of decoded data. The code decodes base64-encoded data and decompresses it, then executes the resulting code dynamically, which is a strong indicator of malicious payload delivery. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns match known malware behaviors such as code injection, payload unpacking, and evasion of static analysis. The code also appears to collect environment or system information and processes it in a way consistent with data exfiltration or credential theft malware. There is no indication of legitimate user interaction or benign application logic. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
