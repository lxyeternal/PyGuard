      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class with an obfuscated name that overrides a method with an obfuscated name. Inside this method, it attempts to spawn subprocesses that execute Python commands importing a module named 'secrevtwo' and its 'dist_util' submodule. The package setup specifies a dependency on 'secrevtwo', which is suspicious and likely a malicious or typosquatted package. The subprocess calls are executed silently during the installation phase without user interaction or notification, which is a common technique in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system during package installation. The obfuscated class and method names, combined with the execution of subprocesses running Python code that imports an external, suspicious package, strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known malware behaviors that hijack Python package installation hooks to execute unauthorized code, potentially leading to remote code execution, persistence, or further payload delivery."
