      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a long base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The base64-encoded command likely contains further malicious instructions or payloads to be executed on the victim system. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors and avoids raising suspicion. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the obfuscation combined with hidden execution strongly indicates malicious intent."
