      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware to evade detection and execute unauthorized actions. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further suggests an attempt to evade detection. The suspicious directory check ('tahg') and the obfuscated parameter name (cOcbrVPoJsoXaSSywxXdsTRhacRytXQE=False) also indicate obfuscation and evasion techniques. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated code execution, stealthy process spawning, and execution during package installation."
