      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a list of filenames from a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), filters them based on the current OS, then downloads files from the same IP using those filenames. It writes these files to disk and executes them immediately without any user interaction or validation. The execution commands differ by OS but all run the downloaded files in the background. The function MOtdFBydLTyOrOGHwwvqJjsIFDbTJRLn is called automatically in all HTTP method wrappers, causing this download-and-execute behavior to trigger on any network request. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, contacts a hardcoded external IP address, writes executables to disk, changes permissions, and runs them silently. This pattern of fetching and executing remote payloads without consent, combined with obfuscation and hardcoded attacker-controlled IPs, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with malware that stages and runs payloads dynamically. There is no legitimate user interaction, no validation of downloaded content, and no benign context. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The import statement references a module named 'frequest' which is a suspicious, likely typosquatted variant of the well-known 'requests' library. The imported names include obfuscated, random-looking identifiers (e.g., eDWltuiSWqxMgFDPWVHvhbMEiGFDeois, miCDkkTxiiiYJIkMeqOcZjSLbSiGqEuH, PUynZhksTfqCoLHZxrXhSGDGnwKfcthw) which is a common obfuscation technique used in malware to hide malicious intent. The presence of a 'delete' import alongside these obfuscated names suggests potential file or data deletion operations. Such obfuscation, combined with a suspicious package name, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it aligns with known malware patterns involving typosquatting, obfuscated imports, and potential unauthorized file operations. Without further code context, the import pattern alone strongly suggests malicious intent."
