      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and executes the decoded content immediately via exec. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the code and executes it without any user interaction or validation. The decoded payload is extremely large and appears to contain multiple layers of obfuscation and potentially harmful operations. The use of exec on base64-decoded data is a classic malware technique to evade detection and deliver payloads dynamically. Given the extensive obfuscation, immediate execution of decoded code, and lack of any benign context or user consent, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
