      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior characterized by the following: It defines a function that collects sensitive system information on macOS platforms, including the output of 'uname -a' (system info), 'id' (user identity), 'pwd' (current directory), and 'ifconfig' (network interfaces). This information is aggregated into a dictionary, serialized to JSON, then base64-encoded. The encoded data is printed and appended to a hardcoded suspicious IP address URL (http:/81.70.191.194:14333/start/), which is then contacted silently via a curl command with suppressed output and a short timeout. This sequence occurs automatically during package setup (installation), without any user interaction or notification, indicating covert data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable and function names further suggest an attempt to evade detection. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent, the hardcoded external IP address, and the automatic execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware."
