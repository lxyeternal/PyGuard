      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/936752659241771009/936753057998442506/Setup.exe) without any user interaction or consent, saves it as 'download.exe' in the current working directory, and immediately executes it using os.startfile. This pattern of automated downloading and execution of a remote binary is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. There is no validation, user notification, or integrity check of the downloaded file, and the use of a Discord CDN URL for hosting the executable is suspicious and attacker-controlled. The function name is obfuscated and does not provide any legitimate context. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
