      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary, potentially malicious code is executed during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during install strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also specifies setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting the conclusion that the package is designed to execute hidden malicious code on Windows systems during installation."
