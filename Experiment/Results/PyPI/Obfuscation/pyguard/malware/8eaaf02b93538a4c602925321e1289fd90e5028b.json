      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated Python bytecode during the package installation process (triggered by 'install' in sys.argv). It uses the marshal module to load and execute a large blob of serialized bytecode, which is a strong indicator of code obfuscation and concealment of malicious payloads. Additionally, it runs shell commands to create a directory named 'DiscordSword' and changes the working directory to 'C:/Users/User/Desktop' without user consent or notification. The use of exec on dynamically loaded bytecode combined with shell commands during installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The code lacks any legitimate user interaction or business logic and suppresses errors silently, further indicating malicious intent. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, arbitrary code execution during install, and unauthorized file system manipulation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports the 'marshal' module and immediately executes marshalled bytecode via exec(m.loads(...)). This is a strong indicator of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of marshal.loads on a byte string to execute code is a known technique to hide the true intent of the code and evade static analysis. Additionally, the code imports 'requests' (aliased as rq), which is commonly used in malware for network communication, often for data exfiltration or downloading further payloads. The variable names are obfuscated and meaningless, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The presence of exec on dynamically loaded marshalled code without any validation or user interaction strongly suggests that the code is designed to execute hidden or potentially harmful payloads. Given these factors and the well-known risk patterns associated with such code, it is highly likely that this code contains malicious behavior."
