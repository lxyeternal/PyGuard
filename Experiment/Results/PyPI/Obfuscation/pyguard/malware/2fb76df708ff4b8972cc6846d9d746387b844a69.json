      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently in the background is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly seen in malware for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
