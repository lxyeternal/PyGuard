      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 decoding to dynamically execute obfuscated Python code during the setuptools setup process. The decoded payload creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.1.69) on port 4444, which is a typical backdoor or reverse shell behavior. It attempts to receive and execute commands from the remote host in a loop, indicating remote code execution capability. This execution happens automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with immediate execution of decoded code, network communication to a suspicious IP, and the creation of a socket server for remote commands are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is a classic example of a supply chain attack or backdoor embedded in a Python package, enabling attackers to gain unauthorized remote access to the victim system."
