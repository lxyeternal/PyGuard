      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed environment information including the hostname and all environment variables, then encodes this data by percent-encoding non-alphanumeric characters. It then establishes a TCP connection to a suspicious, hardcoded external server (packageman.comlu.com) on port 80 and sends this encoded environment data via an HTTP POST request without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration malware. The obfuscated variable names, the silent try/except block suppressing errors, and the execution of this code during the setup phase of a Python package (which is a common vector for supply chain attacks) further confirm malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to silently collect and transmit environment variables and hostname information to an external, non-official domain. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
