      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors and hides execution failures, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window, conditional execution based on directory existence, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
