      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes automatically during package installation. It collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and current user. It attempts to create a suspicious file '/root/j0j0.poc' without user consent. It enumerates directories on the system including '/run/', '/etc/', '/home/', '/mnt/', and '/rasp/', collecting directory listings. It then exfiltrates all this collected information via multiple HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain 'https://j0j0.xyz'. Furthermore, it attempts to read and exfiltrate sensitive system files such as '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts', and '/run/docker.sock' by sending their raw contents to the same external server. The code uses obfuscated variable and class names to evade detection. The network communication is done silently during installation without any user interaction or notification. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators of malicious code, including environment reconnaissance, unauthorized data collection, and automated data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server during package installation. Such use of setuptools install hooks for covert data theft is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious."
