      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated execution or detection. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads, which is a hallmark of malware behavior. Additionally, this execution occurs during the import/setup phase without any user interaction or notification, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, which may be a decoy or part of the malicious package installation. Overall, the use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
