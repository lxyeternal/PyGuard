      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class in a setuptools setup script that executes during package installation. It performs the following suspicious and malicious actions: 1) It retrieves the current Windows user login name and constructs paths inside the user's Start Menu Programs directory, specifically targeting the Startup folder and a folder named 'Powerpoint'. 2) It creates these directories if they do not exist, which is unusual for a typical package install. 3) It uses the 'git' Python module to clone two GitHub repositories ('https://github.com/dcsage/test2lmaos.git' and 'https://github.com/dcsage/defonotagrabber.git') directly into these Start Menu folders. 4) It renames a 'test.py' script from the cloned 'test2lmaos' repository into the Startup folder, which will cause it to run automatically on user login, establishing persistence. 5) It executes a binary 'main.exe' from the 'defonotagrabber' repository inside the 'Powerpoint' folder, which is likely a malicious payload. 6) All these actions happen silently during package installation without user consent or notification. 7) The obfuscated class and method names, combined with the use of user environment data to place files in startup locations and execute external code, are classic hallmarks of supply chain attacks and malware. This behavior enables remote code execution, persistence, and likely data theft or system compromise. Therefore, this code is malicious."
