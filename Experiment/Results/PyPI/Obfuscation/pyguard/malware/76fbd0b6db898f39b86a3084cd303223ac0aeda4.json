      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess to run an encoded PowerShell command in hidden mode is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to execute payloads, download further malware, or perform unauthorized actions without user consent or notification. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of try-except blocks suppresses errors, further aiding stealth. Overall, these behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution during package installation."
