      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information including the current username, hostname, and detailed platform information, then automatically sends this data as a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (http://us.dslab.pw/webhook.php) without any user interaction or consent. This exfiltration of environment and user data during package setup is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. The obfuscated function and variable names, combined with the automatic execution of this data collection and exfiltration during the package installation process (via setuptools.setup call), strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external endpoint is suspicious and attacker-controlled. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment reconnaissance, automated data exfiltration, and abuse of Python package installation hooks."
