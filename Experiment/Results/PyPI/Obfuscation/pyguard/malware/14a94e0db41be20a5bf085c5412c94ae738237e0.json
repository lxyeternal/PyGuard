      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the installation process to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it collects the hostname and IP address of the machine where the package is being installed, then asynchronously sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of obfuscated class and method names, the silent network communication to an attacker-controlled webhook, and execution of code during the install phase strongly indicate malicious intent."
