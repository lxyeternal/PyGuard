      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the Python code, but the use of encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, often used to download or execute further payloads, escalate privileges, or perform stealthy actions. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection or interruption. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution based on directory existence, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
