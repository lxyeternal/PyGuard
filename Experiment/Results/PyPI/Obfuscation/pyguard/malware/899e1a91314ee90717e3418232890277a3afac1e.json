      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to evade repeated detection or to stage further payloads. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, but this part appears benign or a cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window during package setup is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for stealthy code execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious payloads."
