      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it executes a shell command that opens a reverse interactive bash shell connecting to a hardcoded external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7888. This behavior is a classic reverse shell payload, allowing an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine. The execution happens silently during package installation without any user interaction or notification, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The use of os.system to run a bash reverse shell command during install is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as legitimate packages do not execute such network connections or remote shells during installation."
