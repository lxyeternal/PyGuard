      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects extensive system information including OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, network configuration ('ifconfig' or 'ipconfig'), public IP address (via 'curl ifconfig.me'), current user ('whoami'), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive environment and user information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data without user consent or notification is a hallmark of malicious behavior. The code executes this data collection and exfiltration automatically during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the presence of a hardcoded external webhook for data exfiltration confirms malicious intent."
