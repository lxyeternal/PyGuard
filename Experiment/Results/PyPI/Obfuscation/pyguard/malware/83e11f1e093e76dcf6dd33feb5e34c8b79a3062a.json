      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command string using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its intent. The PowerShell is launched with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess to run an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used for executing payloads, downloading further malware, or performing unauthorized actions on the system. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution in the install context strongly indicates malicious intent."
