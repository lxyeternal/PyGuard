      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a hardcoded suspicious IP address (145.249.104.71) and a specific path (/out) without any user interaction or consent. It writes the downloaded content to a hidden file named '.drv' in the user's home directory, sets the file as executable, appends a command to execute this file in the user's .bashrc to ensure persistence, and then immediately executes the downloaded file. This behavior is characteristic of malware performing remote payload delivery, persistence installation, and execution without user knowledge. The obfuscated variable and function names, combined with network retrieval of executable content and automatic execution during package setup, strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks or backdoor installation. The code also uses conditional imports and different HTTP client modules to evade detection or adapt to different Python environments, further supporting malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a file from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://145.249.104.71/out) without any user interaction or consent. It saves this file with a '.drv' extension in the user's home directory, sets the file as executable, and then modifies the user's .bashrc to execute this file in the background on shell startup. This sequence of actions—downloading an executable from an untrusted remote source, setting execution permissions, and establishing persistence by modifying .bashrc—is a classic malware behavior pattern. The obfuscated variable names and lack of any legitimate business logic further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."
