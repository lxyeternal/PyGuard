      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique in malware. This behavior is strongly indicative of malicious intent, as it involves obfuscated code execution without user interaction or notification, consistent with malware patterns such as stealthy payload execution, persistence, or further payload download/execution. The rest of the code invoking 'setup' from distutils.core appears benign and unrelated to the malicious behavior. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window with no legitimate context is a critical risk indicator of malicious activity."
