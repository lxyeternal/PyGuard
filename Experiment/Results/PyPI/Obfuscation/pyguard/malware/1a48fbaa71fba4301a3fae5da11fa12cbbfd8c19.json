      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is suspicious and likely executes hidden or malicious actions on the system. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
