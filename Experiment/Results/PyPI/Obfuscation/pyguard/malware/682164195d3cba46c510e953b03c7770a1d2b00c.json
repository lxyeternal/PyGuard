      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, likely as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The use of subprocess to run an encoded PowerShell command in hidden mode without user interaction or notification strongly indicates malicious intent, as this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. The subsequent call to setup() with a suspicious package name and version appears to be a decoy or an attempt to disguise the malicious code within a package installation script, a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and packaging context confirms the code contains malicious behavior."
