      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, logged-in username, contents of /etc/passwd (on Linux/macOS), OS details, current directory, and directory listing. It then encodes this data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware that performs environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation. The obfuscated variable names and execution of this code in the setup script further indicate a supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the data collected includes sensitive system files (e.g., /etc/passwd), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system and user information without any user interaction or consent, including hostname, logged-in username, OS details, current directory, list of files, and, notably on Linux/macOS, the entire contents of /etc/passwd, which contains sensitive user account information. It uses obfuscated variable names and executes multiple shell commands to gather this data. Although the code snippet does not show explicit data exfiltration, the pattern of automated environment discovery and sensitive data collection is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially credential or information-stealing malware. The absence of any legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling beyond a generic catch block further supports the conclusion that this code is designed for covert data gathering, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
