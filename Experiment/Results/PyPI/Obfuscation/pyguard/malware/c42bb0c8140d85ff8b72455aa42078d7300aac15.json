      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted code executed during installation strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector. The code attempts to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation, which can lead to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a standard setup script, and the presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptographic decryption (fernet) used solely to execute hidden code further confirms the malicious intent."
