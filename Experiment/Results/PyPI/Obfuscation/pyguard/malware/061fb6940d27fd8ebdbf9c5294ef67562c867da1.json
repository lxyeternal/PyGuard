      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It uses base64 decoding combined with exec to execute obfuscated code dynamically, which is a classic malware technique to hide payloads. 2) It uses subprocess (via subprocess.Popen) to spawn PowerShell commands that download a ZIP archive from a suspicious external URL (https://transfer.sh/0tUIJu/Updater.zip) without user consent or notification. 3) The downloaded archive is extracted to a system directory (C:/ProgramData/Updater), a location often abused by malware for persistence. 4) It installs numerous Python packages silently, including ones commonly used in automation and potentially malicious activities (e.g., pycryptodome, pyperclip, pynput). 5) It launches scripts and processes in hidden windows, suppressing output to evade detection. 6) The code runs automatically during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during installation. 7) The obfuscated variable names and lack of legitimate user interaction further support malicious intent. Overall, the code downloads, installs, and executes potentially untrusted code from an external source in a stealthy manner, consistent with malware behavior."
