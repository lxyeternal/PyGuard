      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, suggesting conditional execution to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess.Popen to run an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it aligns with known malware behaviors such as stealthy payload execution, persistence, or downloading/executing further malicious code. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context (distutils.core.setup) suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The try/except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these factors combined strongly indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
