      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of such obfuscated PowerShell execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware to stealthily execute payloads, perform privilege escalation, or download and run further malicious code. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be used as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The subsequent call to setup() with a suspicious package name and version, wrapped in a try/except block, suggests an attempt to disguise or embed malicious behavior within a package installation process, a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
