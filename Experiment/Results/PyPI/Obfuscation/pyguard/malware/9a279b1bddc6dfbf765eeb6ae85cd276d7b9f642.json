      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The process is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and WindowStyle Hidden, indicating an attempt to run stealthily without user awareness. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. This pattern—using base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly used for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution during package installation."
