      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes during package installation. It collects sensitive environment information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username. It attempts to create a file in /root, then enumerates directories in critical system paths (/run/, /etc/, /home/, /mnt/, /rasp/). It then sends this collected directory listing data via multiple HTTP POST requests to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://j0j0.xyz) with paths constructed from the hostname and username, indicating targeted exfiltration of system information. Furthermore, it attempts to read and exfiltrate contents of sensitive files related to Docker environments and root user history (/root/.wget-hsts, Docker container config files) by posting their raw contents to the same external server. The obfuscated class and variable names, absence of user interaction or consent, and the use of network communication during installation strongly indicate malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment reconnaissance, data exfiltration, and abuse of Python package installation hooks for remote code execution and information theft."
