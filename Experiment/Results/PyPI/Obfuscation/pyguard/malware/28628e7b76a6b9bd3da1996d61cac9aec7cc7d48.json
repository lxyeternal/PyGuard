      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it executes a shell command that opens a reverse interactive bash shell connecting to a hardcoded external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7777. This behavior is a classic reverse shell, which allows an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine. The execution happens silently during package installation without any user interaction or notification, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery. The use of os.system to run a bash reverse shell command in the install hook is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise. There is no legitimate reason for such network connections or shell execution during package installation, making this code definitively malicious."
