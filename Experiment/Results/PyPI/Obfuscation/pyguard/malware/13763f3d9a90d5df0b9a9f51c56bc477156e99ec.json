      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://194.163.191.205:6963/builds/Netflix_Checker.exe) and saves it to the user's Documents directory without any user interaction or consent. Immediately after downloading, it launches the executable using os.startfile, which executes the downloaded binary on the victim's machine. This sequence of automated download and execution of a remote binary from an untrusted source is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic, combined with the use of a hardcoded external IP address and execution of an unknown executable, strongly indicates malicious intent."
