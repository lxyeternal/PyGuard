      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The Base64-encoded PowerShell command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the presence of such obfuscation combined with hidden execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try/except blocks suppress any errors, which is typical for malware to avoid crashing or revealing its presence. Overall, these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup."
