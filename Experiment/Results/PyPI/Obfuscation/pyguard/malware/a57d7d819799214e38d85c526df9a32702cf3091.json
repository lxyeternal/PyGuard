      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hijacks the setuptools install command by subclassing 'install' and overriding its install method to execute additional code during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The code collects sensitive environment information including hostname, current working directory, username, and local IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), filtering out private/internal IPs. It also enumerates directories on common root paths (c:\\, d:\\, /, /home). All collected data is hex-encoded and concatenated into a crafted domain name string, which is then resolved via DNS lookup to a suspicious hardcoded domain '425a2.rt11.ml'. Subsequently, it sends an HTTP POST request to 'https://425a2.rt11.ml' containing a JSON payload with the collected system information and directory listings. The obfuscated variable and function names, combined with the lack of user interaction or notification, and the exfiltration of sensitive system and user data to an attacker-controlled server during package installation, are hallmark signs of malicious intent. This behavior aligns with supply chain attacks and credential or environment data theft malware."
