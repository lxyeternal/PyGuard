      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute decrypted code during package installation. Specifically, inside the method qgpIyYaKGPXbnRqLIvDpEYqeILXcQCuJ, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This decrypted payload is not visible in the source and is executed without user interaction or consent during the install process. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, the execution of decrypted code at install time, and the import of network-related modules (requests) strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation, enabling remote code execution, potential data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. The code also restricts this behavior to Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is common in targeted malware. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, dynamic decryption and execution of code during install, and network module usage confirms this code contains malicious behavior."
