      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and immediately executed via exec, a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The code conditionally executes different payloads depending on the operating system, with the Windows branch decoding and running a large base64 string that includes PowerShell commands executed in hidden mode, which is a known method for stealthy execution and potential payload delivery. The non-Windows branch similarly decodes and executes a large base64-encoded script that performs network communication, file system manipulation, and process execution. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution during package installation without user consent. The decoded payloads include references to suspicious domains, environment variable collection, data exfiltration patterns, and dynamic execution of downloaded or embedded code. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code attempts to evade detection by using threading and obfuscation. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as credential theft, remote code execution, and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is conclusively malicious."
