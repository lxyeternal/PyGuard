      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable and function names, which is a common evasion technique. The function 'ZTUcYyfsvCcCMQZKoDsvcwZXBVXpXgqA' performs character code manipulations and then uses eval on the resulting string, indicating dynamic execution of obfuscated code. More critically, the code imports setuptools and immediately executes a shell command via subprocess.getoutput that downloads a shell script from a suspicious external GitHub URL (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/seo.sh), saves it as 'gay.sh' in /tmp, makes it executable, and runs it. This sequence of downloading and executing a remote script without user consent is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery or system compromise. The setup call with a suspicious package name further suggests this is a malicious package designed to execute code during installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and remote script download and execution during package setup confirms the code is malicious."
