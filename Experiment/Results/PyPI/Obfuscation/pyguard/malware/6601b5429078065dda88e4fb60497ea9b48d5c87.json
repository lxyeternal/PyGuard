      "malicious_behavior": "The code establishes a network socket connection to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (\"dzgi0h7on1jhzdg0vknw9pp9309rxjl8.oastify.com\") on port 10010, which is indicative of command-and-control (C2) communication. It then redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket, effectively creating a reverse shell. The code uses obfuscation by base32 decoding a string to obtain the shell executable name, which is then executed with subprocess.call, further hiding its intent. The combination of obfuscated code, hardcoded suspicious external server, network socket redirection to standard streams, and spawning a shell process is a classic pattern of a reverse shell backdoor, a high-risk malicious behavior that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the victim system without user consent or interaction."
