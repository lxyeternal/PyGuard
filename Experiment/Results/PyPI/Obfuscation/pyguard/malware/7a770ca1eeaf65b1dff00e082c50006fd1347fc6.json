It then base64-encodes this data and URL-encodes it as a parameter named 'data'. Immediately after, it sends this encoded sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL 'https://webhook.site/67e7e084-1921-442f-99fe-ba234f471b4e' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive system information. Additionally, the code uses obfuscated variable names and performs this exfiltration during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of such data collection and transmission in a setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
