      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute decrypted code during package installation. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This dynamic execution of decrypted code during installation is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without user consent. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encryption to hide the payload, and the execution of code in the install hook strongly indicate malicious intent. Additionally, the code only triggers this behavior on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is typical for targeted malware. The setup_requires includes 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, execution of decrypted payloads during package installation, and lack of user interaction or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
