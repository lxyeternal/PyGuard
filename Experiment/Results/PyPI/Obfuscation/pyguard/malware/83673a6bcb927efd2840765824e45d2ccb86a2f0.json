      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It uses obfuscated variable and function names, imports modules commonly used in malware (requests, Crypto.Cipher, threading), and contains hardcoded attacker-controlled URLs including a Discord webhook URL. The code collects sensitive user data such as browser cookies, login data, and local files from various browsers and applications by accessing environment variables like APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, and TEMP. It decrypts stored credentials using Windows cryptographic APIs and AES decryption, then exfiltrates this data to the hardcoded webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. The code also attempts to install missing dependencies silently, uses threading to perform background data collection and exfiltration, and packages stolen data into zip archives before sending. The presence of a setup() call at the end suggests this code executes during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. There is no user interaction or consent, and the code attempts to evade detection by suppressing errors and obfuscating its intent. All these factors combined confirm that this code is malicious and designed to steal sensitive information from the victim's machine and send it to an attacker-controlled server."
