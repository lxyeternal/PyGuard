      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command. The PowerShell command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly seen in malware for payload delivery, persistence, or further exploitation. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of try-except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate or benign reason for such obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution in a setup script, and no user interaction or consent is involved. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
