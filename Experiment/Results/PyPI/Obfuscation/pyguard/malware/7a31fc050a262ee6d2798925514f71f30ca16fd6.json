      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The PowerShell is launched with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a typical evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess.Popen to execute an obfuscated PowerShell command in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it is commonly used to download, execute, or stage further payloads without user consent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but does not mitigate the suspicious subprocess invocation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy payload execution and potential further compromise."
