      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), the current working directory (via os.getcwd()), and the username of the user running the install (via getpass.getuser()). It then sends this collected information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard domain 'fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com', which appears to be attacker-controlled. This behavior is executed automatically during package installation without any user interaction or consent. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. Collecting and exfiltrating user and environment information during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware. There is no legitimate reason for this data collection and transmission in a typical setup script. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
