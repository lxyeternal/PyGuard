      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary file containing a Python command that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This is a classic remote code execution pattern where arbitrary code is fetched and run without user consent or validation. The code then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system call that launches the Python interpreter in windowed mode (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'), which is a stealthy execution technique to avoid console windows. This behavior occurs during the setup process of a Python package, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated variable names, temporary file creation, remote code fetching, and immediate execution without any user interaction or validation strongly indicates malicious intent. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are a hallmark of malicious payload delivery and execution."
