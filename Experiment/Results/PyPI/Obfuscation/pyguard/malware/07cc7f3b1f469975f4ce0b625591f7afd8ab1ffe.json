      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class in a setuptools setup script that executes obfuscated code during package installation. It contains a large obfuscated string and a numeric key string, which are used in a loop to XOR-decode the obfuscated string into executable Python code. This decoded code is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). The use of obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution (eval/compile) during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of hidden payloads without user consent or awareness. The obfuscation and execution in the install hook is a classic supply chain attack technique to run arbitrary code on the victim's system during package installation. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscation and dynamic execution in a standard setup script, and no user interaction or notification is present. Therefore, this code exhibits critical risk malicious behavior consistent with malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation."
