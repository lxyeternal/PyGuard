      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The subprocess is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a rudimentary evasion or staging check. The base64-encoded command likely contains obfuscated instructions that could download, execute, or perform other unauthorized actions on the system. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors, which can be a tactic to evade detection or analysis. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
