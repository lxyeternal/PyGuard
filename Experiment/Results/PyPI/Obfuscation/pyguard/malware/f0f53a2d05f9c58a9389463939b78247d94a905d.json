      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware to execute payloads stealthily, perform privilege escalation, or download and run further malicious code. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be used as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspicious package metadata, which is often abused in supply chain attacks to execute malicious code during package installation. The combination of obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
