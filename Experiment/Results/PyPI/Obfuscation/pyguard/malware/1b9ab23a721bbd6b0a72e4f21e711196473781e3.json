It then changes the file permission to executable and runs system commands to update the package list and install 'tmux' silently. Finally, it executes the downloaded shell script with specific arguments using subprocess. This sequence of downloading and executing remote code without validation or user consent is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The obfuscated function and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the external URL is not a known trusted source, increasing the risk that this is a malware payload delivery and execution mechanism."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads scripts from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/inits-v4/) without any validation or user consent. It then executes the downloaded content directly as shell commands via subprocess with shell=True, including with elevated privileges (sudo) for the 'sys' script. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. There is no integrity check, no user interaction, and no logging or notification before executing potentially untrusted code. This pattern of fetching remote code and executing it immediately is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise. The use of subprocess to run arbitrary downloaded scripts, especially with root privileges, combined with obfuscated naming and hardcoded suspicious URLs, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware and supply chain attacks."
