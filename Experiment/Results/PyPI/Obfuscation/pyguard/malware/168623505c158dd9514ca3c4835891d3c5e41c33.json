      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads to be executed silently. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The obfuscation, hidden execution, and use of encoded PowerShell commands strongly indicate malicious intent."
