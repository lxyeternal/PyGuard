      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell scripts. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW and '-WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it involves obfuscated code execution without user interaction or notification, consistent with malware techniques for payload delivery, persistence, or system compromise. The rest of the code involving distutils setup appears benign but is likely a decoy or to disguise the malicious payload within a package installation context, a common supply chain attack vector."
