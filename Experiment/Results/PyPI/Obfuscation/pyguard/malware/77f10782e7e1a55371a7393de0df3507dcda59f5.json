      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the Python package installation process (setup script) and performs actions automatically during install/build commands without user interaction or consent. It targets Windows-specific environment variables and system paths such as APPDATA, Desktop, Start Menu, and TaskBar locations, which are common persistence or user environment locations. The code creates a hidden directory under APPDATA named 'Extension' and writes obfuscated JavaScript code (background.js) and a manifest.json file for a Chrome extension. The JavaScript code repeatedly runs a function that manipulates the clipboard content, replacing cryptocurrency addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known clipboard hijacking technique used to steal cryptocurrency transactions. The script then enumerates all shortcut (.lnk) files in user and system start menu and taskbar locations, and modifies shortcuts to Chrome, Edge, Brave, and a launcher executable to load the malicious extension by adding a command line argument '--load-extension' pointing to the created extension directory. This behavior is a classic persistence and infection vector to inject malicious browser extension code stealthily into popular browsers. The obfuscation of the JavaScript code and the silent installation of the extension without user consent further confirm malicious intent. The use of win32com to manipulate Windows shortcuts and the check for admin privileges to extend persistence to system-wide locations also indicate an attempt to maximize infection scope. Overall, this code is a supply chain or installer-based malware that silently installs a clipboard hijacking browser extension and modifies browser shortcuts to ensure its execution, which is a high-risk malicious behavior."
