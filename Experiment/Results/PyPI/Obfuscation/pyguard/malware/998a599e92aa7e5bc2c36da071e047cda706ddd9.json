      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute arbitrary decrypted code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable and class names, combined with the execution of decrypted code during installation, strongly indicate an attempt to hide malicious payload delivery and execution. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead runs hidden code, which could perform any number of harmful actions such as downloading further malware, stealing data, or compromising the system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
