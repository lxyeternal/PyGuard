      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation with meaningless variable and function names, making analysis difficult and hiding intent. The code imports builtins and uses exec to execute dynamically generated code. It contains large blocks of compressed or encoded binary data passed as byte strings to functions that decompress and execute them, a classic technique for hiding payloads. The code dynamically constructs and executes code from obfuscated sources, including use of exec on decompressed data, which is a hallmark of malware. It references suspicious URLs (GitHub repository named 'billythegoat356/Hyperion' and a Discord invite) that are unrelated to benign libraries, suggesting a malicious project. The code also uses complex, nonsensical control flows and try/except blocks that serve to evade detection and analysis. The presence of functions that manipulate globals and execute code from strings, combined with obfuscated data blobs, strongly suggests it downloads or contains payloads that are executed at runtime. The code runs automatically on execution without user interaction or consent, another red flag. Overall, the combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution from compressed data, suspicious external references, and lack of legitimate application logic confirms this code is malicious."
