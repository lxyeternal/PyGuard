      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It hooks into the setuptools install command to execute code during package installation without user consent. It collects sensitive environment information including hostname, current working directory, username, IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6), and directory listings of common root/user paths. It encodes this information in hex and constructs a suspicious domain name dynamically. Then it performs a DNS lookup on this constructed domain and sends a POST request with the collected data to a hardcoded external server 'https://425a2.rt11.ml'. The obfuscated variable and function names, the use of netifaces to gather network interface IPs, and the exfiltration of detailed system information during install are strong indicators of a supply chain attack or information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code runs automatically on install, which is a common vector for malicious Python packages. The behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as environment reconnaissance, data encoding, and automated data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server."
