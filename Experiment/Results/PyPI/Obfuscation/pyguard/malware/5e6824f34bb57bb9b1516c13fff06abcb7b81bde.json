      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior. It performs an automated installation of numerous packages, including those commonly used in malware (e.g., pyperclip, pyotp, pycryptodome, psutil, win32gui). It then imports a large set of modules, including those for system interaction, cryptography, clipboard access, and Windows registry manipulation. Most critically, it uses exec() on a large, gzip-compressed, marshalled payload, which is a classic obfuscation and dynamic code execution technique used to hide malicious payloads. The use of marshal.loads combined with gzip.decompress and immediate exec() is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis and execute hidden code. The code lacks any user interaction or legitimate business logic and instead focuses on obfuscated code execution, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Given these factors and the known risk patterns, this code is malicious."
