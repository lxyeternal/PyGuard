      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be used as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The subsequent call to setup() with typical package metadata appears benign but is likely a cover or part of a supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, lack of user consent, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
