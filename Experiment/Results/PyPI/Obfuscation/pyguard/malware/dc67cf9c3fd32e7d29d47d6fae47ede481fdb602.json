      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The subprocess is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to run it stealthily without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to execute payloads, download further malware, or perform system compromise without user consent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The suspicious package name 'uggkg7u9im9e5fae' and the lack of legitimate user interaction or notification further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."
