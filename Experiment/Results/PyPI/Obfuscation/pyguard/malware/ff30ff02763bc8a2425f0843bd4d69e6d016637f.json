      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a setup script that hooks into the installation/build process on Windows platforms to silently install a Python package dependency (pypiwin32) if missing, then creates a hidden Chrome extension in the user's APPDATA directory. It writes obfuscated JavaScript code into background.js and a manifest.json file that requests clipboard read/write permissions. The script then enumerates common user shortcut locations (Start Menu, Taskbar pinned items, Desktop) and modifies shortcuts to Chrome, Edge, Brave, or launcher.exe to load the malicious extension on browser startup. The JavaScript code repeatedly replaces clipboard contents with hardcoded cryptocurrency addresses, effectively hijacking clipboard data to redirect cryptocurrency transactions to attacker-controlled addresses. The use of obfuscated JavaScript, silent installation of dependencies, writing files to user and system directories without notification, and modification of browser shortcuts to load a malicious extension are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This is a classic clipboard hijacker malware technique that operates stealthily during package installation, leveraging the setup process for persistence and execution without user consent."
