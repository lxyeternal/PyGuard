      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. Inside this class, there is a large obfuscated string which is XOR-decoded using another string key. The decoded string is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscation combined with dynamic code execution during package installation is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it allows execution of hidden arbitrary code without user consent. The obfuscated payload is embedded directly in the install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The package name and metadata are suspicious and generic, and the obfuscation prevents static analysis of the payload. There is no legitimate reason for such obfuscation and dynamic execution in a setuptools install script. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation."
