      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes during the package setup phase and attempts to import subprocess, installing it if missing, which is suspicious. It then uses subprocess.run to execute a PowerShell command that downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~/WindowsCache.exe'. Immediately after downloading, it executes this file via Invoke-Expression. This behavior is a classic pattern of malicious code: downloading and executing an untrusted binary without user consent or validation, during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suggests stealth execution to avoid user detection. The code suppresses errors silently with try/except and does not notify the user or perform any legitimate business logic. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent, specifically remote code execution and payload delivery from an untrusted source."
