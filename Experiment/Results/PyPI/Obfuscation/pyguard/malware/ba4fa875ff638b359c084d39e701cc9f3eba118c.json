      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the presence of such obfuscated PowerShell invocation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The package name 'pk12czxw0ocw7n80' appears random and suspicious, consistent with typosquatting or malicious packages. The try-except blocks suppress any errors silently, which is typical in malware to avoid raising suspicion. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, conditional execution based on file system state, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
