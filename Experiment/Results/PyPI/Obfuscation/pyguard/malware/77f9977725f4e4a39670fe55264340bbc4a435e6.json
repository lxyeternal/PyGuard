      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute arbitrary decrypted code during package installation. Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This occurs silently during installation without user interaction or consent. The obfuscated variable and class names, combined with the use of encrypted payload execution at install time, are classic hallmarks of a supply chain attack. The code targets Windows systems (os.name == 'nt') and attempts to run hidden malicious code during package installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the pattern matches known malware behaviors involving code obfuscation, dynamic execution, and abuse of Python packaging hooks."
