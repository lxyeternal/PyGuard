It then immediately executes this downloaded executable via Invoke-Expression. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware: downloading and executing a potentially untrusted binary without user consent or notification. The code runs this during the setup process, which means it executes automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. Additionally, it tries to suppress the subprocess window (using subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW), indicating an attempt to hide execution from the user. The use of obfuscated variable names and the silent try/except blocks further suggest evasion techniques. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and run an external executable silently. Therefore, this code contains clear malicious behavior."
