      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a suspicious, non-standard external URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh) directly into the user's home directory without any user consent or validation. It then changes the file permission to executable and runs system commands to update the package list and install 'tmux' silently. Finally, it executes the downloaded shell script with specific arguments. This sequence of downloading and executing remote code without validation or user interaction is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise. The obfuscated function and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the use of a suspicious domain and direct execution of downloaded code strongly suggests malicious intent."
