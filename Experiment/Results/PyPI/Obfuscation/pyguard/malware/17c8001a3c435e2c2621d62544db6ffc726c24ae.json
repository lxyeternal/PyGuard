      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques, including base64 encoding, zlib compression, and complex lambda functions to hide its true intent. The code dynamically constructs and executes Python code using eval and exec on decoded and decompressed payloads, which is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis. The presence of obfuscated strings, dynamic execution of decompressed base64 data, and the use of eval on constructed character sequences strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden or unauthorized payloads. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are not typical of benign software. The code does not perform any legitimate user interaction or business logic and instead focuses on decoding and executing concealed code, which is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
