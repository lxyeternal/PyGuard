      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 decoding combined with marshal.loads to dynamically reconstruct and execute Python bytecode via exec. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the code. The decoded payload is not statically visible, preventing easy inspection. Such use of marshal and base64 decoding followed by immediate execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is almost exclusively observed in malware samples to conceal and run unauthorized or harmful code. The obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and evasion of static analysis. Without explicit user interaction or legitimate context, this pattern is highly suspicious and strongly indicative of malicious behavior."
