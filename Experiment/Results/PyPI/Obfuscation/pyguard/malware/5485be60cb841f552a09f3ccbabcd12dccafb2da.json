      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that is decoded and immediately executed as a shell command during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). The decoded command uses 'curl' to silently download a file named 'strings.bat' from a suspicious external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1169414844689174588/1188945374312943665/strings.bat) into a temporary directory, then executes it with 'start /min cmd /c'. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the command, the download and execution of a remote script from a non-official domain, and the execution triggered in the install hook of setuptools are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a high-risk indicator of remote code execution and potential system compromise."
