      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports numerous modules commonly used in malware, including pyperclip, threading, requests, httpx, and win32crypt for credential decryption. It uses heavy obfuscation by importing marshal and gzip, then decompressing and executing a large compressed payload via exec(marshal.loads(gzip.decompress(...))). This pattern of multi-layered decoding and immediate execution is a classic hallmark of malicious code used to evade detection and analysis. The code lacks any user interaction or legitimate business logic and immediately executes hidden, obfuscated code. The presence of win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData suggests it may attempt to decrypt Windows credentials or sensitive data. The combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and imports related to clipboard access, process spawning, and network communication strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for credential theft, data exfiltration, or remote code execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
