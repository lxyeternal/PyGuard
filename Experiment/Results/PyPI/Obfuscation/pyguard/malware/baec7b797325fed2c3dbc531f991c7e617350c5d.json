      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling, system execution, and URL opening, then writes and executes a command that fetches and runs code from a suspicious external URL (https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/bcexv/raw). This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and executes remote code without user consent. Additionally, the package setup metadata uses suspicious and obfuscated names and keywords related to 'botting' (e.g., 'youtube botter', 'viewbot'), which is often associated with malicious automation tools. The combination of obfuscation, remote code execution during package installation, and network activity without user interaction confirms that this code exhibits malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed immediately via exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules related to temporary file handling and system execution, then writes and executes a command that fetches and executes code from a suspicious remote URL (https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/bcexv/raw) without user consent or notification. This behavior is typical of malware that downloads and runs remote code dynamically. Additionally, the code uses obfuscated variable and function names, imports system modules for shell command execution, and performs system clearing and title setting commands, which are common evasion and stealth techniques. The presence of threading, system calls, and obfuscated execution further supports the conclusion that this code is designed for malicious purposes such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or data exfiltration."
