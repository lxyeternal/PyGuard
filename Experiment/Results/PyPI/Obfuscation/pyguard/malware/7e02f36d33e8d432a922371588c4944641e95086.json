      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a URL, which is decoded at runtime. This URL is a Discord webhook endpoint, a common method for exfiltrating data to an attacker-controlled server. The function takes an authorization token and user response data, then makes a GET request to Discord's API to retrieve sensitive billing information associated with the authorization token. It then sends a POST request to the decoded webhook URL containing detailed user information including username, avatar URL, user ID, email, phone number, operating system, and billing data. This pattern of collecting sensitive user credentials and environment information and exfiltrating it silently to a hardcoded external endpoint without user consent is a hallmark of credential-stealing malware. The obfuscation of the webhook URL and the lack of any user interaction or notification further confirm the malicious intent."
