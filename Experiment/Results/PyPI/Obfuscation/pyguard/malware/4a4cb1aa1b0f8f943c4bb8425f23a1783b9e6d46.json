      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts. The obfuscated variable names, the use of encrypted code execution during installation, and the conditional execution only on Windows further indicate an attempt to hide malicious payload delivery. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code executes arbitrary decrypted code during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
