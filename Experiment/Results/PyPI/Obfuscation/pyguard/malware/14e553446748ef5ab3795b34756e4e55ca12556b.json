      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to perform unauthorized data collection and exfiltration. Specifically, during installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via multiple HTTP GET requests to suspicious, hardcoded external domains (e.g., 'j0j0.xyz'). Furthermore, it attempts to read sensitive system files such as '/etc/debconf.conf', '/.dockerenv', and '/root/.wget-hsts'—files that may contain configuration, environment, or credential information—and uploads their contents via HTTP POST requests to the same external server. This behavior occurs silently during package installation without user consent or notification, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class and variable names, combined with the exfiltration of sensitive system and user data to attacker-controlled domains, are strong indicators of malicious intent. Such automated data collection and exfiltration during installation is a hallmark of malware and credential-stealing attacks."
