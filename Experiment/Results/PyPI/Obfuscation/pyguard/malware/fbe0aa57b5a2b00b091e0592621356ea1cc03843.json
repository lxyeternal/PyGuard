      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior. It installs a large number of packages, including those commonly used in malware (e.g., pyperclip, pyotp, pycryptodome, psutil, win32gui, winregistry). It then imports numerous modules related to system manipulation, cryptography, clipboard access, and network communication. Most critically, it uses exec() on a large, compressed, and obfuscated payload (gzip decompressed and marshal loaded), which is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious code. The use of exec on dynamically decompressed and unmarshalled data is a hallmark of malware attempting to evade static detection. The code lacks any user interaction or legitimate business logic and immediately executes hidden, obfuscated code. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration. Therefore, this code should be considered malicious."
