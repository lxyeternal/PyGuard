      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install_scripts command class that executes code during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. It collects detailed environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and the public IP address of the host by querying external services (http://ip.dhcp.cn/?json and http://ifconfig.me/ip). It then encodes this information into a hex string and performs DNS queries to a suspicious domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net', which is a known domain used for out-of-band interaction testing and often abused by attackers for data exfiltration or command and control. The obfuscated variable and function names, the automatic execution of network requests and DNS queries during installation without user consent or notification, and the exfiltration of system and network information to an attacker-controlled domain are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior fits the pattern of a supply chain attack that silently collects and leaks host information during package installation, which is a critical security risk."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed environment and system information including hostname, current working directory, and public IP address by querying external services. It then encodes this information into a hex string and sends it via DNS queries to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain 'hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net', which is a known domain used for out-of-band interaction and data exfiltration in security testing and attacks. The obfuscated variable names and the method of exfiltration via DNS requests strongly indicate covert data leakage. There is no user interaction or consent, and the code attempts to gather and transmit system information stealthily. This pattern matches known malicious behaviors related to information stealing and covert exfiltration. Therefore, the code is malicious."
