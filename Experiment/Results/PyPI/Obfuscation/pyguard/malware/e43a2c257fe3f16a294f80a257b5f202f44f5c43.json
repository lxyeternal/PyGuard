      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during the installation process, downloads a Python script from a remote URL and executes it immediately without any user interaction or validation. The URL is constructed in an obfuscated manner using multiple variables, which is a common evasion technique. The downloaded file is saved as 'qrcodegen.py' in the current working directory and then executed via subprocess. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling remote code execution during package installation. There is no indication of user consent, integrity checks, or validation of the downloaded code, which poses a high security risk. The obfuscation of variable names and URL construction further suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Such automatic downloading and execution of remote code during installation is strongly associated with malware and is a critical risk indicator."
