      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a base64-encoded shell command during package installation. This shell command initiates a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (13.93.28.37) on port 1337 by spawning a bash shell connected to a socket. The command is obfuscated by base64 encoding and immediately decoded and executed via os.system, which is a classic technique to evade detection. Executing a reverse shell during package installation is a hallmark of a supply chain attack and remote code execution malware. The code uses obfuscated class and variable names, no user interaction or consent is required, and the payload is executed silently during install. This behavior is strongly indicative of malicious intent, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor that allows an attacker to gain shell access to the victim system upon package installation."
