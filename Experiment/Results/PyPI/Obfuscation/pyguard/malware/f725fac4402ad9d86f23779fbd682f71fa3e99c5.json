      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of distutils.setup with a suspicious package name ('keml6dxzrljr9ash') and the silent try/except blocks further indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity during package installation. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as stealthy code execution, obfuscation, and potential persistence or payload delivery during package installation, all of which are strong indicators of malicious intent."
