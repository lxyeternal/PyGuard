      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and uses non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It performs conditional checks on sys.platform and sys.argv to trigger different behaviors. The code imports modules like pip and win32com, dynamically constructs strings and paths, and performs file system operations such as creating directories and writing files in user or system directories. It uses COM Dispatch to create and save shortcuts, indicating attempts to establish persistence or execute payloads. The code walks through directories, searches for files with specific extensions, and creates shortcuts pointing to these files, which is a common technique for malware to maintain execution or spread. The obfuscation and dynamic string construction, combined with environment variable access, file writing in system/user paths, and COM object manipulation, strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also appears to execute during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscation, persistence mechanisms, and potential payload deployment. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
