      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is part of a setup script that executes code during package installation, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. Specifically, the read_version() function performs the following suspicious actions: it spawns a subprocess running a script named 'version' located in the 'polaris' directory, which is unusual and potentially malicious. It then collects detailed environment information including the hostname (platform.node()), system information (platform.uname()), current working directory, and network interface details (output of 'ifconfig' filtered for IPv4 addresses). This collected data is concatenated and base64-encoded, then sent via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://1.15.77.2/v/). This sequence of environment fingerprinting and silent data exfiltration without user consent or notification is a hallmark of malware. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the data being sent further supports malicious intent. Additionally, the package name 'i4abuctaptjpcb0s' appears random and suspicious, consistent with typosquatting or malicious packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying these actions. Therefore, this code is malicious, performing unauthorized environment data collection and exfiltration during package installation."
