      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or unnecessary execution. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the use of encoded PowerShell commands in hidden mode is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly used for stealthy execution of payloads, downloading or executing further malicious code, or establishing persistence. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, which appears benign but may serve as a cover or to facilitate installation. Overall, the presence of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered automatically without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
