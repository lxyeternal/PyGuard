      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated variable names and the use of encrypted payloads further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The setup script also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, which are used only in the malicious install hook. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is executed during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
