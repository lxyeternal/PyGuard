      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command being executed. The command is run in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is a common stealth technique used by malware to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which may be used as a marker to avoid repeated execution. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden shell process, is a classic malware behavior pattern for executing arbitrary or harmful code stealthily. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution in the installation script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
