      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing further payloads, given the presence of a URL-like string within the encoded data. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these behaviors align strongly with known malware patterns involving obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of installation scripts for malicious payload delivery."
