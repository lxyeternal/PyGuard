      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the installation process to execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation. It collects extensive system information including OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, network configuration ('ifconfig' or 'ipconfig'), public IP address (via 'curl ifconfig.me'), current user ('whoami'), and hostname. This information is then exfiltrated by sending it in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, execution of multiple shell commands to gather sensitive environment and user data, and automatic data exfiltration during package installation without user consent or notification are hallmark indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware that abuses Python package installation hooks to stealthily collect and leak system and user information to an attacker-controlled endpoint."
