      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell scripts. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The package name 's1nktdqmfod1tyi5' appears suspicious and random, consistent with typosquatting or malicious packages. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
