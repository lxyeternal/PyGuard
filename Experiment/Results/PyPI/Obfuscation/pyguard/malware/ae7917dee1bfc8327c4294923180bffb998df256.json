      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class that executes code automatically during package installation without user interaction. It collects sensitive environment information such as the current username (via 'whoami'), the home directory (via 'echo $HOME'), and the platform information. It then constructs and executes shell commands that send HTTP GET requests to a hardcoded external IP address (http://3.221.152.203:8000) with URL paths embedding the collected system information. This behavior constitutes silent data exfiltration of user and system environment details to an attacker-controlled server during package installation. The obfuscated function and variable names, the use of os.popen to execute shell commands, and the lack of any legitimate user notification or consent further indicate malicious intent. Such automatic environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware."
