      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. It defines a function that collects sensitive process information from the /proc filesystem (e.g., cmdline, status, stat, statm of the current process) and writes it to a file named 'proc_info.txt' without user consent or notification. Then, in the main function, it attempts to establish a TCP connection to a hardcoded IP address (3.228.3.164) on port 80. Upon successful connection, it redirects the standard input/output/error file descriptors to the socket and spawns an interactive bash shell via pty.spawn. This effectively creates a reverse shell, allowing remote command execution on the victim machine. The code is embedded in setuptools install and egg_info command hooks, meaning it executes automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated function and variable names, lack of user interaction, and the combination of environment data collection with network communication and shell spawning confirm malicious intent. This behavior enables an attacker to remotely control the victim system and exfiltrate sensitive information stealthily."
