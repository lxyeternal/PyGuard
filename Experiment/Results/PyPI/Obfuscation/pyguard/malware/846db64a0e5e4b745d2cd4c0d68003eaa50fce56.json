      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads and executes remote scripts from untrusted external URLs without any user interaction or consent. Specifically, it uses os.system to run a PowerShell command that downloads a batch file from a GitHub repository and executes it with a long token-like argument, then deletes the batch file. It also runs a curl command to download and execute a shell script from the same repository with the same token argument. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code directly is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise. The absence of any validation, user notification, or legitimate context, combined with the use of hardcoded suspicious URLs and execution of downloaded payloads, strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands that download and run scripts from untrusted external URLs without any user interaction or consent. Specifically, it uses PowerShell to download a batch file from a GitHub repository (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanc5po/xmrig/main/miner.bat) to a temporary file and executes it with a long argument string, then deletes the batch file. It also runs a curl command to download and execute a shell script (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ivanc5po/xmrig/main/ubuntu_install.sh) with the same argument. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code from suspicious URLs, especially from a repository named 'xmrig' (commonly associated with cryptocurrency mining malware), is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The code performs automated, non-interactive execution of potentially harmful payloads, consistent with malware that installs and runs unauthorized miners or other malicious software. The benign characteristics such as user notification, validation, or legitimate business logic are absent, confirming the malicious intent."
