      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The command is run with the window style set to hidden and with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating an attempt to avoid user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of base64 encoding for the PowerShell command, hidden execution, and subprocess spawning of PowerShell are strong indicators of malicious intent, as these patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are commonly used for stealthy code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this code exhibits multiple key risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks."
