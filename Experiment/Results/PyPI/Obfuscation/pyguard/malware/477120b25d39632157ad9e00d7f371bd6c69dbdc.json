      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains obfuscated instructions, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell with an encoded command, combined with the suppression of errors via try/except and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification, aligns with typical malware behaviors such as stealth execution, code obfuscation, and potential payload delivery or system compromise. The subsequent call to setup() with a suspicious package name and typical metadata appears to be a decoy or an attempt to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, these factors strongly indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
