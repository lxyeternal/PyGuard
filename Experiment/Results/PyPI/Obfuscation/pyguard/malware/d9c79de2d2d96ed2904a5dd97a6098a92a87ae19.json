      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware and supply chain attacks. Key malicious characteristics include: 1) Execution of base64-decoded payloads written to disk and immediately executed in a hidden subprocess, without user interaction or notification. 2) Use of obfuscated variable and function names to evade detection. 3) Automatic installation of multiple dependencies commonly used in malware (e.g., psutil, aiohttp, cryptography) during package installation. 4) Collection of sensitive user environment information such as USERPROFILE, APPDATA, and TEMP directories, and writing files to obscure locations like '__pycache__' in temp folders. 5) Extraction and exfiltration of sensitive data including browser cookies (via browser_cookie3), Chrome passwords, Telegram data, and other credential stores. 6) Use of asynchronous tasks and threading to stealthily perform data collection and network communication. 7) Construction and sending of HTTP POST requests with encoded sensitive data to hardcoded or suspicious endpoints, including IP addresses and domains not associated with legitimate software. 8) Execution of shell commands and PowerShell with encoded commands in hidden windows, a known technique for stealthy code execution and payload delivery. 9) Downloading and executing additional code from remote URLs (e.g., GitHub repositories, updater.git), enabling remote code execution and further compromise. 10) Absence of any legitimate user interaction or business logic, with all suspicious activities triggered automatically during package installation or module import. 11) Use of cryptographic decryption and dynamic code execution (exec) on decoded payloads, a hallmark of obfuscated malware. 12) Attempts to evade detection by checking for file existence, creating directories, and self-deleting or overwriting files. 13) Collection of user login information and environment tags, likely for targeted attacks or profiling. 14) Use of clipboard access libraries (pyperclip) combined with suspicious imports and behaviors, indicating potential clipboard hijacking or credential theft. 15) Hardcoded suspicious URLs and IP addresses, including webhook URLs and attacker-controlled servers. These combined behaviors strongly indicate that the code is malicious, designed to steal credentials, exfiltrate sensitive data, execute arbitrary code, and maintain persistence on the victim system."
