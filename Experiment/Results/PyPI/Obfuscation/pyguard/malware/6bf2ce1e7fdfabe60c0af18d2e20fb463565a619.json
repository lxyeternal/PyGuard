      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It defines an obfuscated function that decodes a base64-encoded string into a shell command. This decoded command is executed via os.system during the package installation and development setup phases by overriding setuptools install and develop commands. The base64 string decodes to a curl command that silently downloads data from a suspicious, non-standard external URL (https://ac9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app) with environment variables passed, indicating potential data exfiltration or remote code execution. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, execution of shell commands during install without user consent, and contacting an attacker-controlled domain are hallmark indicators of a supply chain attack and remote code execution malware. This behavior is consistent with known malicious patterns of executing arbitrary code during package installation to compromise the host system."
