      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command, which is executed silently (hidden window) without user interaction or notification. The presence of the directory existence check ('tahg') before launching the process suggests conditional execution to evade repeated runs or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with encoded commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to execute arbitrary or harmful payloads stealthily. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The obfuscation, stealth execution, and installation-time code execution collectively indicate that this code contains malicious behavior."
