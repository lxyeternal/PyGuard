      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), the current working directory (via os.getcwd()), and the username of the current user (via getpass.getuser()). It then sends this collected information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io'. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware that performs environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during package installation without user consent or notification. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. Executing network communication during installation to an attacker-controlled server to exfiltrate system and user information is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware."
