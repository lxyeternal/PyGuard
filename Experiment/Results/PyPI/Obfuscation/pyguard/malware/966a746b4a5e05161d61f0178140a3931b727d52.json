      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware evasion technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or unnecessary runs. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with an encoded command in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to execute payloads, download further malware, or perform unauthorized actions without user knowledge. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The try-except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection or prevent interruption. Overall, these behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution during package installation."
