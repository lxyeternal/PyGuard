      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware evasion technique. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which may be used as a marker to avoid repeated execution. The use of subprocess.Popen to run an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates that this code is malicious."
