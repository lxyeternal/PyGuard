      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command being executed. The command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a stealth or persistence check. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and WindowStyle Hidden suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The obfuscation and hidden execution of PowerShell commands, combined with the lack of any legitimate user interaction or notification, strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute potentially harmful or unauthorized actions on the host system."
