      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a common malware tactic. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, likely as a persistence or evasion mechanism. The use of subprocess.Popen to run an obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but does not mitigate the suspicious subprocess execution. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and potential persistence mechanisms."
