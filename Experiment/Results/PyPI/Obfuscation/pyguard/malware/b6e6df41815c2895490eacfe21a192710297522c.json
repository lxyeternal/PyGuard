      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install process to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. The function wKwxfPsyOBsxTWVfELNNzcLIFnVYBkGl() collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (host identifier) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php', which is a classic data exfiltration pattern. Furthermore, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr', saves it with an obfuscated name 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it using os.system('start ...'). This sequence of collecting system information, exfiltrating it, downloading a remote executable, and running it during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, suppresses errors silently, and performs network and file operations without user interaction or notification. These behaviors align with critical risk patterns for malicious Python code, including remote code execution, data exfiltration, and payload delivery during package installation."
