      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute additional code during package installation. In the overridden method, it imports networking and system modules, collects the hostname and IP address of the machine, and sends this information along with detailed platform information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system information without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the execution of network communication during installation, and the presence of a hardcoded external webhook URL are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation to gather and leak sensitive environment data. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
