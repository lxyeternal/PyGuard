      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. Although it masquerades as a setup script for a legitimate package, it includes obfuscated code that collects sensitive environment information such as the current working directory name, the current user's username, and the hostname. It then XOR-encodes this information with a fixed key, base64-encodes the result, and sends it via a crafted HTTP GET request to a remote server whose address is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime. This network communication occurs silently during the package setup without any user interaction or notification. The obfuscation of variable names, the use of base64 encoding to hide the remote endpoint, and the automatic exfiltration of system information during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in a setup script, and it matches multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including environment reconnaissance, data encoding, and covert network exfiltration."
