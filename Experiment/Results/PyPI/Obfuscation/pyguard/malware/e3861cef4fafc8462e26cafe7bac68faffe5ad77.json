      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method (with an obfuscated name) to execute a subprocess call during package installation. This subprocess call runs a Python command that imports a module named 'ptmpl.post_install' and calls its 'download_and_run_script()' function. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class and method names, combined with executing code from a potentially untrusted module during install, suggest the package is designed to download and run potentially harmful code without user consent or interaction. This behavior is consistent with malware that hijacks the installation process to execute remote code, which can lead to remote code execution, payload delivery, or system compromise."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a suspicious, non-standard external URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh) using a malformed curl command string passed to urllib.request.urlretrieve, which is incorrect usage and likely to fail, but the intent is clearly to fetch a remote script. It then saves this script to the user's home directory, changes its permissions to executable, installs tmux silently via apt without user interaction, and executes the downloaded script with bash passing several arguments. This sequence of downloading and executing a remote script without validation or user consent, combined with obfuscated function and variable names, use of shell commands, and execution of potentially untrusted code, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The code performs automated remote code retrieval and execution, which is a strong indicator of malware or a supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate user interaction, no validation of the downloaded content, and the remote URL is not a known trusted source. These factors collectively indicate that the code is malicious."
