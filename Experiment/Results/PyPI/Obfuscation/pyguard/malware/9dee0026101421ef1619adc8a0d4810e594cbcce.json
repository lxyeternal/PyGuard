      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a classic technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be an evasion or staging technique. The presence of this behavior in a setup script context further indicates a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. These characteristics align strongly with known malware patterns, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and unauthorized code execution, confirming the code is malicious."
