      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command, which is executed silently (WindowStyle Hidden) and without user interaction or notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to evade repeated execution or detection. The use of subprocess.Popen to run PowerShell with encoded commands in a hidden window is a well-known hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for stealthy execution of payloads, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further malicious code. Additionally, the presence of a try/except block suppresses any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The subsequent call to setup() with a suspicious package name and version appears to be a decoy or an attempt to disguise the malicious code within a package installation script, a common supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealthy process spawning, and packaging context strongly indicates malicious intent."
