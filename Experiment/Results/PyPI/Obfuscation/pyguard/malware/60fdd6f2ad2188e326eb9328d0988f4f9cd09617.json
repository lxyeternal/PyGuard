      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user interaction or consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation strongly indicates that the code is designed to run hidden malicious code on the victim's machine during package installation. The setup call also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, which are used only in the malicious install hook, further confirming the intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user notification, and the code executes arbitrary decrypted code, which could perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, persistence, or system compromise."
