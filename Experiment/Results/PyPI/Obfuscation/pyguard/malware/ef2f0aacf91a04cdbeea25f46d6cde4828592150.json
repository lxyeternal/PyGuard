      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell scripts. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables execution of obfuscated commands without user consent or interaction. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, which is typical in malware to avoid crashing or revealing its presence. The rest of the code is a standard setup call with a suspiciously random package name, which may be used to disguise the malicious payload. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell command execution in hidden mode, conditional execution based on file system state, and embedding in a setup script strongly indicates malicious intent."
