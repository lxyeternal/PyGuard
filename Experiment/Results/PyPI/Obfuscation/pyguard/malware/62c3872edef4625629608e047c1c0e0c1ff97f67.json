      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute decrypted code during package installation. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large base64-encoded payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This dynamic decryption and execution of code at install time is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of cryptographic decryption to hide the payload, and execution without user consent or interaction strongly indicate malicious intent. The code targets Windows systems (os.name == 'nt') and executes the decrypted payload during installation, which is a known vector for remote code execution and malware delivery. The presence of network-related imports (requests) suggests possible network communication or data exfiltration in the decrypted payload. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and execution during package installation."
