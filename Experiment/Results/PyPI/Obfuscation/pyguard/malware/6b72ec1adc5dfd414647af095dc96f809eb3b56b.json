      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute obfuscated, base64-encoded code during package installation. This decoded code performs the following malicious actions: it retrieves the current user's login name and constructs paths to the Windows Startup folder, then writes a PowerShell script to that folder to establish persistence by running a hidden PowerShell shell. It also downloads and writes a batch file that executes a command to silently download and run a file named 'bypass.exe' from a suspicious external URL hosted on discordapp.com, which is a known vector for malware distribution. The code uses obfuscation (base64 encoding) to hide its intent and suppresses errors to evade detection. The execution of arbitrary shell commands, writing to user startup directories, downloading and executing remote payloads without user consent, and running code during package installation are all hallmark behaviors of supply chain attacks and malware. Therefore, this code contains clear malicious behavior."
