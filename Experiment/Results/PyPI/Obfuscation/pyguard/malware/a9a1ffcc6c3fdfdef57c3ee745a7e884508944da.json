      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a subprocess command during the package setup process that uses PowerShell to download an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and then immediately executes it. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware: it downloads and runs a potentially untrusted binary without user consent or validation. The subprocess is run with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without a visible console window. The code attempts to install the subprocess module if missing, which is unusual and suspicious in this context. The execution occurs automatically during the setup phase, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. There is no user interaction, no validation, and no legitimate business logic justifying this behavior. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
