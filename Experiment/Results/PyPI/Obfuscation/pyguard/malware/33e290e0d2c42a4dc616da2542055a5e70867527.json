      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or consent. It creates a suspicious directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' (which mimics a Windows system folder but is non-standard and likely intended to evade detection), moves the downloaded executable there with a non-descriptive name 'XMICNEI.exe', and immediately executes it using os.startfile. This sequence of automated download, storage in a hidden or unusual system-like directory, and execution of an untrusted binary is a classic malware behavior pattern. The package setup metadata uses a suspicious package name and keywords ('hack'), and the install_requires list includes standard libraries incorrectly (e.g., 'os', 'shutil' are standard and should not be in install_requires), indicating obfuscation or lack of legitimate intent. There is no validation, user notification, or security checks on the downloaded content. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious payload delivery, remote code execution, and supply chain attacks. Therefore, the code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or consent. It creates a suspicious directory path (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), which mimics system folder naming conventions but is non-standard and likely intended to evade detection. The downloaded file is saved as 'main.exe' in the current directory, then immediately renamed and moved into this suspicious directory under the name 'XMICNEI.exe'. Finally, the code launches this executable silently using os.startfile. This sequence—automatic download of a binary from an untrusted external source, saving it to a hidden or unusual system-like directory, and immediate execution without validation or user notification—is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, specifically for payload delivery and execution. There is no error handling, no integrity checks, no user prompts, and no legitimate business logic, indicating malicious intent. The use of obfuscated variable names and the choice of directory further support this conclusion."
