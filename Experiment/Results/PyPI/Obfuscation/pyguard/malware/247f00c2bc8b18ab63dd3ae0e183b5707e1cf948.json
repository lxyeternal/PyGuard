      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the command being executed. The PowerShell window is hidden (WindowStyle Hidden) and the process is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The base64-encoded command likely contains further instructions or payloads to be executed on the victim system. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The use of try/except blocks suppresses errors and avoids raising suspicion. All these factors combined—obfuscated PowerShell command execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution based on file existence, and execution during package setup—are strong indicators of malicious behavior."
