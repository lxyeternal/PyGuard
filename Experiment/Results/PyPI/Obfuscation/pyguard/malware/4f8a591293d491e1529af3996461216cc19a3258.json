      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) without any user consent or validation, writes it to the current working directory as 'pics.exe', and then immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen. This pattern of fetching and running an untrusted binary from a remote source is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. There is no user interaction, notification, or integrity check before execution. The use of requests to silently download and subprocess to execute the file without any safeguards strongly indicates malicious intent."
