      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect user credentials by prompting for passwords on different operating systems using native dialog tools (zenity on Linux, osascript on macOS, and PowerShell credential prompt on Windows). It then exfiltrates the collected username, hostname, and password to a hardcoded external URL (https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/) without user consent. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, conditional OS-specific credential prompts, and immediate network transmission of sensitive data are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code writes files named '.pwned.txt' or 'pwned.txt' in user or system directories as fallback or notification, which is suspicious. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification about data collection or transmission. This behavior matches typical credential-stealing malware patterns, including environment awareness, credential harvesting, and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled endpoints."
