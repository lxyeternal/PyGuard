      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it enables execution of potentially harmful or unauthorized commands in the background without user consent. Additionally, the use of distutils setup with a suspicious package name and the try/except blocks suppressing errors further indicate an attempt to hide malicious activity during package installation. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window, combined with stealth and obfuscation techniques, is a definitive indicator of malicious intent."
