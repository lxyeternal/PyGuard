      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and character substitution to hide its true functionality. It decodes a large base64-encoded string, then applies a complex character mapping to reconstruct Python code, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of obfuscation combined with dynamic execution of decoded code is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such techniques are commonly used in malware to evade detection and analysis. The use of exec on dynamically decoded and transformed data without any validation or user interaction is a critical risk factor. Given the extensive obfuscation and immediate execution of hidden code, this script likely performs unauthorized or harmful actions, consistent with known malware behaviors."
