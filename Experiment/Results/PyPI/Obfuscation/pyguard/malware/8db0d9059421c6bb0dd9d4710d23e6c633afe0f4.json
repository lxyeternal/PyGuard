      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. The process is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of 'powershell -WindowStyle Hidden' suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique in malware. This behavior is strongly indicative of malicious intent, as it involves obfuscated code execution without user interaction or notification, consistent with known malware patterns such as stealthy payload execution or further malicious payload download/execution. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window during package setup is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
