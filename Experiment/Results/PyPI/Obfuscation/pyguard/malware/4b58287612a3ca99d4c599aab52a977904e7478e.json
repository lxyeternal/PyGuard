      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using hexadecimal escape sequences and base64 encoding, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. It uses eval on dynamically decoded and decompressed data, which is a critical risk indicator for arbitrary code execution. The code imports base64, compile, exec, str.encode, and bytes, then defines functions that decode and transform data, ultimately executing decoded payloads. The presence of multiple layers of decoding and the use of eval and exec on the decoded content strongly suggest that the code is designed to execute hidden or dynamically generated malicious payloads. This pattern is a hallmark of malware that attempts to evade detection by obfuscation and dynamic execution. There is no indication of legitimate user interaction or benign application logic. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
