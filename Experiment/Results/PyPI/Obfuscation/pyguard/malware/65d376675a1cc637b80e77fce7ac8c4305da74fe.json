      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a classic malware technique for stealthy execution. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, but this part is benign or a decoy. The critical malicious indicator is the hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during module import or setup, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery. There is no legitimate user interaction, no logging, and the subprocess call suppresses output, all consistent with malicious intent."
