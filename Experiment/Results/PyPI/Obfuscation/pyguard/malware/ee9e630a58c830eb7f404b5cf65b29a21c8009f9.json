      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious payloads. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a staging or marker directory for the payload. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it involves obfuscated code execution in a hidden context without user interaction or consent. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is executed during package installation. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup."
