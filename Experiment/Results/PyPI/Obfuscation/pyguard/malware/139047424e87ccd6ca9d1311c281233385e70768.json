      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class in a setuptools setup script that executes obfuscated code during package installation. Specifically, it contains a large obfuscated string and a numeric key string, which are used in a loop to XOR-decode the obfuscated string into executable Python code. This decoded code is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval and compile) on decoded data, and execution during the install phase are strong indicators of malicious behavior. Such patterns are typical in supply chain attacks where malicious payloads are hidden inside seemingly benign packages and executed automatically upon installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscation and immediate execution of decoded code without validation or transparency is a hallmark of malware aiming to evade detection and perform unauthorized actions on the host system."
