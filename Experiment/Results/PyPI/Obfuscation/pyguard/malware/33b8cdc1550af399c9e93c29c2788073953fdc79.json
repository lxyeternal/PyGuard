      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function that collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them as URL parameters, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://webhook.site/8f782c5b-990f-4d3d-94cc-fd128b873693). This exfiltration of environment data occurs automatically during the package installation and development setup phases by overriding setuptools' 'install' and 'develop' commands. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. There is no user interaction or consent, and the data sent may contain sensitive information such as credentials or tokens present in environment variables. This behavior is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks that steal environment information during package installation."
