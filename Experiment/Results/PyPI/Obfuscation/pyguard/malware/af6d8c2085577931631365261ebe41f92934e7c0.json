      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and immediately sends an HTTP POST request to it with a message payload ('niger') without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is indicative of automated data exfiltration or unauthorized communication to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions hides any errors, which is a common evasion technique. Additionally, the code is embedded within a setuptools setup script, which means this network communication occurs during package installation, a known vector for supply chain attacks. The presence of obfuscated variable names and the silent execution of network requests during installation further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of base64 decoding combined with exec calls to execute dynamically decoded code. It imports the 'requests' module and performs an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common exfiltration technique. The code also imports cryptographic functions and performs decryption on the decoded payload before execution, indicating an attempt to hide the true payload and evade detection. The use of exec on decoded and decrypted data without any validation or user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The hardcoded webhook URL and the immediate execution of remote code strongly suggest this code is designed to exfiltrate data or execute unauthorized commands on the host system. These behaviors align with typical malware patterns such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, and obfuscation to evade detection."
