      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses the 'requests' library to fetch Python code from a remote URL ('https://pastebin.com/raw/f84dfw0m') and immediately executes it using 'eval'. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code without any validation or user consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. It enables arbitrary code execution on the host system, which can lead to compromise, data theft, or further payload delivery. Additionally, this execution occurs during the package setup phase, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The package name appears random and suspicious, further supporting the likelihood of malicious intent."
