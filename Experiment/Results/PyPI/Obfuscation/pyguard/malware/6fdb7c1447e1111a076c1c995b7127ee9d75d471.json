      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string using subprocess.Popen. The command is executed with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which is a known stealth technique to avoid user detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is not directly visible, indicating obfuscation to hide its true intent. The code also checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess to run encoded PowerShell commands in hidden mode is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly used for executing payloads, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further malware. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscation, stealth execution, and execution during package installation."
