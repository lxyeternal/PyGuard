      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to send the host's system information (hostname and IP address) to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user consent or notification. This behavior occurs automatically during package installation, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated class and method names, the hardcoded external webhook URL, and the silent exfiltration of system information are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and transmission. Such automated data exfiltration during installation is a hallmark of malware and supply chain compromise."
