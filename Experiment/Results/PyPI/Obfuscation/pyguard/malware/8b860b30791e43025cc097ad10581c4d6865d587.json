      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command, which is executed silently (WindowStyle Hidden) and without user interaction or notification. The presence of this encoded PowerShell command, combined with the use of subprocess.Popen to execute it in a hidden window, strongly indicates malicious behavior. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The obfuscated command and the stealthy execution pattern align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code obfuscation, stealth execution, and potential for downloading or executing further malicious payloads. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign but is likely a cover or part of the malicious package installation process."
