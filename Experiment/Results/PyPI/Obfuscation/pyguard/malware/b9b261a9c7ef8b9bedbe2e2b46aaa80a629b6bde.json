      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and compression (base64, zlib) combined with dynamic execution via eval and exec. It constructs and executes code at runtime from compressed and encoded data, which is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The code uses obfuscated variable names and lambda functions to hide its intent. The presence of eval(\"exec\") on decompressed and decoded data strongly indicates execution of hidden payloads. Such patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are used to evade detection and analysis. The code does not contain any legitimate user interaction or business logic and appears designed to execute arbitrary code dynamically, which is a critical risk indicator of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
