      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded and Fernet-encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated code without user consent or validation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of obfuscation (encrypted payload), execution of decrypted code at install time, and conditional execution only on Windows further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."
