      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes into it a Python command that downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/m3qfu/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This is a classic pattern of remote code execution from an untrusted source. Then, it attempts to execute this temporary file by spawning a new Python interpreter process with a modified executable name (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe') and passing the temporary file path as an argument, which likely runs the downloaded code silently. This behavior occurs during the setup process of a Python package, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The code uses obfuscated variable names and performs no user interaction or validation before executing remote code. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an external source during package installation without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes into it a Python command that imports urllib.request.urlopen and immediately executes code fetched from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/xnouv/raw) via exec. This is a classic pattern of remote code execution from an untrusted source without any validation or user consent. After writing the code, it closes the file and then executes it by spawning a new Python process using the system shell command. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temporary file, and executing downloaded code directly from a remote URL are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of dynamic payload delivery, remote code execution, and potential system compromise. There is no legitimate reason for such behavior in benign software, and it poses a critical security risk."
