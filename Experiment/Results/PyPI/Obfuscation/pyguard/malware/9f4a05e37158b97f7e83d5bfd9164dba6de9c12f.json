      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during the installation process, downloads a Python script from a hardcoded external URL ('https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py') without any validation or user consent, writes it to the local file system as 'qrcodes.py', and immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This behavior enables arbitrary remote code execution during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection. There is no indication of legitimate purpose or user interaction before this potentially harmful code runs. Such automatic downloading and execution of remote code during installation is strongly associated with malicious activity and is a critical security risk."
