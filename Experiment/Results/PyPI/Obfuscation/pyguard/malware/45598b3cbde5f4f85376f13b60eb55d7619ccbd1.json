      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hijacks the Python package installation process by overriding the 'install' command in setuptools/distutils with a custom class that executes arbitrary shell commands. Specifically, during installation, it attempts to copy a binary named 'pip_security' from a 'rootkit/dist' directory to '/usr/local/bin/rootkit', then runs this binary with an 'install' argument, and finally launches the 'rootkit' binary in the background. The use of the name 'rootkit' strongly suggests intent to install stealthy, persistent malware. The code also automates building and uploading a package when invoked with the 'publish' argument, including building the 'pip_security.py' executable with PyInstaller inside the 'rootkit' directory. The obfuscated class and method names, combined with shell commands that copy and execute files in system directories without user consent or notification, are classic hallmarks of supply chain attacks and malware installation. This behavior is not typical or legitimate for standard Python packages and is consistent with malicious payload delivery and execution during package installation."
