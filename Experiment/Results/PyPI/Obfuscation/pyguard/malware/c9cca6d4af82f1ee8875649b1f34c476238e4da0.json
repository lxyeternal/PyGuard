      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the window, indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a staging or marker directory for the payload. The base64-encoded command is not decoded or inspected in the code, but the use of encoded PowerShell commands combined with hidden execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try/except blocks suppress errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
