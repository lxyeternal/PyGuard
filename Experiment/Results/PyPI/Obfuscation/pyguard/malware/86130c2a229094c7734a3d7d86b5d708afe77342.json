      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the command being executed. The command is run only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests a stealth or persistence check. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealthy execution. The Base64-encoded PowerShell command likely performs unauthorized actions such as downloading or executing further payloads, or system compromise. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The try/except blocks suppress errors, which is typical in malware to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
