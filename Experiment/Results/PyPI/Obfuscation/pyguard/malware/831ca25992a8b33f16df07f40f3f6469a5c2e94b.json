      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. This pattern of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly used for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing malicious code execution during package installation without user consent. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
