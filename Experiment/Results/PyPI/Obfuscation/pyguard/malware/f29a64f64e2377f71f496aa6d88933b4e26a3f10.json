      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent, commonly seen in malware for executing payloads, downloading further malicious code, or performing system compromise. Additionally, the presence of this code in a setup script context suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but does not mitigate the suspicious subprocess invocation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
