      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of malicious behavior, especially in Python package installation scripts (supply chain attack vector). The obfuscated variable names and the use of exec on decrypted data without any user interaction or validation strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine during package installation. The presence of 'requests' suggests possible network activity, and the use of 'fernet' for decryption indicates the payload is concealed to evade detection. This behavior is consistent with malware that performs remote code execution and possibly further payload delivery or data exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
