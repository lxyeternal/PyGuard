      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname, current working directory, and the username of the user running the installation. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io'. This behavior constitutes automated, silent data exfiltration of system and user identity information without user consent or notification. The obfuscated class and variable names, combined with the execution of network communication during package installation, are hallmark indicators of a supply chain attack or malicious package. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it leverages the trusted installation process to gather and leak sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server."
