      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide the true intent of the command. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, indicating stealthy execution. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of an obfuscated PowerShell command executed silently during the import/setup phase is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is typical for malware to execute payloads or perform system modifications without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in try/except, which appears benign but may serve as a decoy or to blend in as a legitimate package. Overall, the presence of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered automatically without user interaction or notification is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
