This data exfiltration occurs automatically during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL and automatic data exfiltration during installation strongly indicates malicious intent, as it leaks user and system information to an attacker-controlled server without legitimate purpose or notification."
