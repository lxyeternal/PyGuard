      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with silent execution in the background, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The presence of obfuscation, hidden process spawning, and lack of legitimate user interaction or business logic strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
