      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware. It imports modules commonly used in malware (requests, Crypto.Cipher, threading), uses obfuscated and nonsensical variable and function names to evade detection, and contains hardcoded attacker-controlled URLs including a Discord webhook URL for data exfiltration. The code attempts to install missing dependencies silently, accesses environment variables to locate sensitive directories (APPDATA, LOCALAPPDATA, TEMP), and uses Windows API calls to decrypt stored credentials. It scans browser data directories for cookies, passwords, and tokens, decrypts them, and exfiltrates the collected data to the hardcoded webhook URL. The code also collects user IP information and Discord relationships, formats this data, and sends it to the attacker. It uses threading to perform these actions concurrently and suppresses errors to avoid detection. The presence of a setup() call at the end with obfuscated parameters suggests this code executes during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily collect sensitive user data (browser cookies, passwords, tokens), package it, and send it to an attacker-controlled server without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of malicious credential-stealing malware."
