      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), the current working directory (via os.getcwd()), and the username (via getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io'. This behavior is characteristic of data exfiltration and environment reconnaissance typically seen in malware. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Executing such network communication automatically during package installation without user consent or legitimate purpose is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware."
