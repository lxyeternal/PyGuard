      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code runs this behavior during import/setup time without any legitimate user action, which is typical of supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign but is overshadowed by the malicious subprocess invocation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
