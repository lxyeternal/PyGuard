      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed immediately via exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules to download and execute code from a remote URL (http://51.103.210.236:80/inject/VSpinLJKHaPMTkic), which is suspicious and typical of malware behavior. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as random and meaningless class and function names, and it executes shell commands to clear the screen and set the console title, indicating attempts to manipulate the user environment stealthily. The initial base64 decoding and execution happen without user interaction or notification, which is a hallmark of malware. The presence of threading and system calls further supports the likelihood of background malicious activity. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including obfuscated code execution, remote code fetching and execution, and environment manipulation, confirming it is malicious."
