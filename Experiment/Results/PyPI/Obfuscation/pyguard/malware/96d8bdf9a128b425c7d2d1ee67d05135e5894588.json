      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It hooks into the Python package installation process (setup script) to execute code during 'build', 'egg_info', 'bdist_wheel', and 'install' commands on Windows platforms. It attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package silently if missing, then proceeds to create a hidden Chrome extension in the user's APPDATA directory under 'Extension'. The extension includes obfuscated JavaScript code that repeatedly runs a function every second to manipulate the clipboard content. Specifically, it replaces cryptocurrency addresses in the clipboard with attacker-controlled addresses, a classic clipboard hijacking technique used to steal cryptocurrency transactions. Furthermore, the script enumerates common user shortcut locations (Start Menu, Taskbar pinned items, Desktop) and modifies shortcuts to Chrome, Edge, Brave, and a 'launcher.exe' to load the malicious extension by adding a command-line argument '--load-extension' pointing to the created extension folder. This persistence mechanism ensures the malicious extension is loaded whenever these browsers are launched, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated JavaScript, silent installation of dependencies, writing to system/user directories, and modification of shortcuts to inject malicious payloads are hallmark signs of malware, specifically a clipboard hijacker targeting cryptocurrency users. The code runs automatically during package installation, without user interaction, further confirming its malicious intent."
