      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it attempts to retrieve the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' (which identifies the host machine) and sends an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL ('https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php') with the computer name appended as a query parameter. This behavior constitutes silent collection and exfiltration of host system information without user consent or notification. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The network communication occurs automatically during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for this data collection and transmission in a typical setup script. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
