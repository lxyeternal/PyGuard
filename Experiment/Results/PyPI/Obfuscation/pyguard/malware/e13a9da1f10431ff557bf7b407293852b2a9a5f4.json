      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which suggests conditional execution to evade detection or repeated execution. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, commonly used for executing payloads, downloading further malware, or performing unauthorized actions on the system. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The obfuscation, stealth execution, and context strongly indicate this code is malicious."
