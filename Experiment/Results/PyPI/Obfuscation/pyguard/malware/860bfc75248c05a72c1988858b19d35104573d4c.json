      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically constructs a URL to a suspicious external domain ('http://files.inostage.ru/version/check/a') and then uses the requests module to fetch content from this URL. It immediately executes the fetched content using exec(), which is a critical risk pattern strongly associated with malware. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code without any validation or user consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling remote code execution and potential payload delivery. Additionally, the code collects the hostname of the machine, which may be used for system fingerprinting or targeted attacks. The obfuscated variable names and lack of legitimate context further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."
