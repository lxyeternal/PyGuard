      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines obfuscated function and variable names, which is a common evasion technique. The function NmgbGkblerfApfhccMAagXUABSbwGKvt() attempts to create a reverse shell by connecting to a hardcoded external IP address (59.110.111.85) on port 8088, then redirects standard input/output/error to the socket and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary commands on the victim system. The function CQvDADVkktxBZLfGSCUFBWviDEolLjCh() creates a file /tmp/test1563.txt, which is used as a marker to prevent repeated execution of the reverse shell. The reverse shell function is launched in a separate thread immediately during the package setup process, without any user interaction or notification, indicating stealthy and automatic execution. The presence of this code in a setuptools setup script suggests a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes during package installation. These behaviors—hardcoded attacker-controlled IP, reverse shell creation, obfuscated names, automatic execution during install, and use of threading for stealth—are hallmark signs of malware and remote access trojans (RATs)."
