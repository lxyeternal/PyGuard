      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute additional code during package installation. Specifically, it imports networking-related modules and the Discord webhook client, collects the local machine's hostname and IP address, and sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior constitutes automated data exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious activity. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The presence of a hardcoded external webhook URL used to silently transmit host information during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
