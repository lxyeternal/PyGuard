      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a GitHub raw link to 'test.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable to the current working directory with an obfuscated filename ('tmp_file_pypi_29x7d0kf8.exe') and immediately executes it using a shell command ('start' on Windows). This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware: automatic retrieval and execution of potentially untrusted code from a remote source. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is indicative of evasion techniques. The code runs automatically during the package setup process, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate business logic justifying this behavior. The presence of network communication to download an executable and immediate execution without user consent or security checks strongly indicates malicious intent."
