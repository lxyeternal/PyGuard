      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a large encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The code executes arbitrary, obfuscated code during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscation of variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads, and execution during installation are all consistent with malware techniques to evade detection and deliver payloads. Additionally, the setup configuration specifies Windows as the target OS, indicating a targeted attack vector. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
