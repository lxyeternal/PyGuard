      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It fetches URLs from hardcoded, suspicious external sources (pastebin.com raw URLs and https://utilities.tk), which are attacker-controlled. It sends HTTP POST requests to a URL obtained dynamically from one of these external sources, exfiltrating information such as a message '@everyone' and the local directory path without user consent. It writes a randomly named Python script file (.pyw) in the current directory with content downloaded from an untrusted external URL, then immediately executes this script in a subprocess without any validation or user interaction. This sequence of downloading, writing, and executing remote code is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery. The code runs automatically during the setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated or meaningless variable names (e.g., csSZLcNODzZkDVmhWXEnqDMNKZZCtBma) and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification further confirm malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and execute arbitrary code from attacker-controlled servers and exfiltrate system information, which is highly malicious."
