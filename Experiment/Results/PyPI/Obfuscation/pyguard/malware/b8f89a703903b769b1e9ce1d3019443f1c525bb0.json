      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects extensive system information including OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, network configuration ('ifconfig' or 'ipconfig'), public IP address (via 'curl ifconfig.me'), current user ('whoami'), hostname, and running tasks ('tasklist' on Windows). It then sends all this sensitive environment and system information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of sensitive system and user data during package installation without user consent or notification is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated class and variable names, the execution of multiple shell commands to gather environment data, and the immediate network transmission to an external endpoint during install time strongly indicate malicious intent. Such behavior is not typical or legitimate for standard Python packages and is consistent with malware patterns that perform environment reconnaissance and data exfiltration during installation."
