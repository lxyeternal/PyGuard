      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it executes this hidden PowerShell command, which is a common evasion and stealth technique. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden process, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, this execution occurs during the import/setup phase without any legitimate user consent or interaction, which is typical of supply chain or installation-time malware. The rest of the code attempts to run a standard setup call but is wrapped in a try/except that suppresses errors, possibly to avoid detection. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window triggered automatically indicates malicious behavior."
