      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with launching it in hidden mode, is a classic technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, which is typical in supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed during package installation. The presence of try/except blocks suppresses errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior."
