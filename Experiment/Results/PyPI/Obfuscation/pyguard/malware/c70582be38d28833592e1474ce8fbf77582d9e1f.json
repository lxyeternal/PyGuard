      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and zlib compression, which is a common evasion technique. The code collects sensitive user information such as usernames, hardware IDs, IP addresses, MAC addresses, and system environment variables. It accesses and decrypts browser data including cookies, passwords, history, and credit card information from various browsers by copying SQLite databases and decrypting stored credentials using Windows APIs. The code kills processes related to Discord to presumably avoid detection or interference. It sends the stolen data to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and remote servers via HTTP requests. The code also downloads and executes remote payloads, including scripts and binaries, without user consent. It uses subprocess calls with obfuscated PowerShell commands and runs code during package installation (setup), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, webhook URLs, and IP addresses further confirms its malicious intent. Overall, this code is a credential stealer and information exfiltration malware designed to silently harvest and transmit sensitive data from the victim's machine."
