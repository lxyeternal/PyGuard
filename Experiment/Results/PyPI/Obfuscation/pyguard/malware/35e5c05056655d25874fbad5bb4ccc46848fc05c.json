      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The presence of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is a common technique used by malware to execute payloads stealthily. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before execution, which may be used as a marker to avoid repeated execution or detection. The use of distutils.setup with a suspicious package name and the try/except blocks suppressing errors further suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity during package installation. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious setup usage aligns with known malware behaviors such as stealthy payload execution and potential supply chain attack vectors."
