      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable names and base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically via exec, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious intent. The decoded payload imports 'os' and 'requests', checks for the existence of a suspicious file ('hifromDreamyOak'), and if not present, performs a network GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious URL (a Discord CDN link hosting a Windows executable). It then writes the downloaded content to a temporary file and executes it via subprocess. This sequence is a hallmark of malware that downloads and runs a remote payload without user consent. The code is embedded in a setuptools setup script, meaning it executes during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code exits immediately after execution, likely to evade detection. These behaviors—dynamic code execution from obfuscated data, network retrieval of executable code, execution of that code, and embedding in a package installation script—are all critical risk indicators of malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or validation, writes it to a temporary file, and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source. The absence of any integrity checks, user consent, or legitimate context, combined with obfuscated variable names and direct execution of a downloaded binary, matches known malware techniques for payload delivery and execution. Such behavior is commonly used in malware to stage and run malicious payloads, making this code highly suspicious and malicious."
