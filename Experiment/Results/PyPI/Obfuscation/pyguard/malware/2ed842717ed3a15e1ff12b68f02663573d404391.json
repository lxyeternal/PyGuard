      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscation by storing a base64-encoded string that, when decoded, contains Python code which is immediately executed via exec(). This decoded code imports 'os', checks for the existence of a file named 'hifromDreamyOak' and exits if present, then imports 'requests', 'tempfile', and 'subprocess', and performs a network GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/accounts/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe). The response content is written to a temporary file and then executed as a subprocess. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable without user consent is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a remote code execution and payload delivery technique. The obfuscation, lack of user interaction, execution during package setup, and network activity to a non-standard URL all strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1109115014054416495/1109465188433936425/Windows.exe) without any user interaction or validation. It writes this executable to a temporary file and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern of fetching a remote binary and executing it directly is a classic hallmark of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. There is no indication of user consent, integrity checks, or any legitimate business logic. The obfuscated variable names and the direct execution of a downloaded executable strongly indicate malicious intent, consistent with known malware behaviors such as payload delivery, remote code execution, or backdoor installation."
