      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. It uses heavy obfuscation, including base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and immediately written to files in a hidden temporary directory. These files ('main.cpython-39.py' and 'scripts.cpython-39.py') contain further obfuscated code that is executed via subprocesses without user interaction or consent. The code accesses environment variables to locate user-specific temporary directories and writes executable scripts there, which is a common persistence and staging technique. It spawns subprocesses using 'pythonw.exe' with hidden windows, evading user detection. The code collects sensitive user information such as usernames and system paths, and performs automated HTTP POST requests to suspicious endpoints, indicating data exfiltration. It also includes functionality to extract browser cookies (e.g., via 'browser_cookie3') and other sensitive files, then encodes and sends this data to remote servers. The installation hook triggers this behavior automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, base64-encoded PowerShell commands, and multiple layers of decoding and execution further confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code is designed to stealthily collect, exfiltrate sensitive data, and execute arbitrary code on the victim system without authorization."
