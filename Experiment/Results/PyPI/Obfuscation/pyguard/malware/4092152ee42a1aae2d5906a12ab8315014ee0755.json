      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command using subprocess.Popen. The command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess to run obfuscated PowerShell commands in a hidden window is a strong indicator of malicious intent, often associated with downloading or executing further payloads, privilege escalation, or persistence mechanisms. The rest of the code is a benign-looking setup call, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution during import or setup is a hallmark of supply chain or installation-time malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
