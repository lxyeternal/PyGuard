      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes during package installation. It performs the following suspicious and malicious actions: 1) It retrieves the current Windows user login name and constructs paths inside the user's Startup folder and Start Menu Programs folder, which are sensitive locations for persistence and auto-execution. 2) It creates directories in these locations if they do not exist, indicating preparation for persistence or payload placement. 3) It uses the gitpython library to clone two GitHub repositories from attacker-controlled URLs directly into these sensitive directories. 4) It moves a Python script ('test.py') from one cloned repository folder into the Startup folder, likely to ensure execution on user login. 5) It executes an executable ('main.exe') from the second cloned repository inside the Start Menu Programs folder, which is likely a malicious payload. 6) All these actions happen silently during package installation without user consent or notification, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. 7) The obfuscated class and method names, combined with the use of hardcoded external GitHub URLs and execution of downloaded code, strongly indicate malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution during install, persistence via Startup folder, and execution of untrusted binaries. Therefore, the code is malicious."
