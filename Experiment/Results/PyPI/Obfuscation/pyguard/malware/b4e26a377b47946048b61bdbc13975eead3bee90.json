      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes a Python command that downloads and executes code from a remote URL ('https://rentry.co/ki74h/raw') using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This dynamic retrieval and execution of remote code without any validation or user consent is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. Furthermore, the code attempts to execute the temporary file using a system call that launches a new Python interpreter process with a modified executable name (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'), which is often used to run Python scripts in a hidden window on Windows, indicating stealthy execution. The obfuscated variable names and lack of legitimate user interaction or notification further support the malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as remote code download and execution, use of temporary files for staging, obfuscation, and stealth process spawning, all of which are strongly associated with malware."
