      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a setuptools setup script that overrides the 'install' and 'develop' commands to execute a function during package installation or development setup. This function collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them as URL parameters, and attempts to send them via an HTTP request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL ('https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app'). The environment variables can contain sensitive information such as credentials, tokens, or system configuration. The code uses obfuscated function and variable names, which is a common evasion technique. The network communication is performed silently during installation without user consent or notification, indicating automated data exfiltration. The use of a non-standard, attacker-controlled domain (ngrok-free.app) further supports malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to send the data using urllib.request.Request but contains a coding error (urllib.shSNxfbWuwvLUOdMWsajUEGPMQhfXsTF.Request), which suggests obfuscation or tampering to evade detection. Overall, this pattern of collecting environment variables and exfiltrating them during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and credential-stealing malware."
