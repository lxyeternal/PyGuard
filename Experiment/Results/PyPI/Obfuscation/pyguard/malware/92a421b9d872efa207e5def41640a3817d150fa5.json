      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, combined with spawning a hidden shell process, is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which may be a persistence or evasion technique. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, but the key malicious indicator is the hidden execution of an obfuscated PowerShell command during import or setup. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks or malicious package installation scripts that execute unauthorized code on the victim system. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
