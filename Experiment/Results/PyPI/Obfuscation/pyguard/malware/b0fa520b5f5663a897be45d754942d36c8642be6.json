      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed silently (hidden window style), which is a well-known technique for stealthy code execution and evasion. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or unnecessary execution. The use of subprocess to spawn PowerShell with an encoded command, combined with the suppression of errors via try/except and the lack of any user interaction or notification, strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the setup call with a suspicious package name ('ttsy3rw1itt2vy4n') and the use of try/except to suppress errors further suggest an attempt to hide malicious activity during package installation. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of package installation hooks for executing hidden payloads."
