      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a variable with an obfuscated name (pLBMqNgOQSBgaWzqbvlbSKjrEznmAmBe) from a local module named 'setup' and immediately unpacks it as keyword arguments into the setuptools.setup() function. This pattern is highly suspicious because it indicates that the actual setup configuration is hidden or obfuscated in the imported variable, which is a common technique used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary or malicious code during package installation. The obfuscated variable name and unusual import from a local 'setup' module (shadowing the standard setuptools setup) strongly suggest an attempt to hide malicious payload or behavior. Given the context of setup scripts being a known vector for executing code on install, and the obfuscation present, this code is very likely malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools' install command that, during installation, collects all environment variables, serializes them to JSON, and then passes this data to a function imported from an obfuscated module (setup.utils.UjQdJAoTPxoTpHQGuvZhqvdYYquRTzxo), presumably encoding or encrypting it. Then, in a method (dxaIfPoMEAjJCYjItAJgcrGkXPdLVOIn), it constructs an obfuscated HTTPS URL from fragmented strings and sends the encoded environment data via an HTTP POST request to this hardcoded suspicious domain ('cdwa8tk2vtc0000yhygggg6frpcyyyyyb.oast'). This behavior—silent collection and exfiltration of environment variables during package installation without user consent, use of obfuscated variable and function names, and network communication to a suspicious domain—is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and data exfiltration malware. The code also calls a method on the base install class with the same obfuscated name, suggesting further hidden or chained malicious actions. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive environment information during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
