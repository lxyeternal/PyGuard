      "malicious_behavior": "The code hooks into the setuptools install command to execute a function automatically upon package installation without user interaction or consent. This function writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with the content 'proof bug by kotko' to the current directory, which is suspicious as it creates a file without clear legitimate purpose. It then collects sensitive environment information: the public IP address of the host (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current script's directory (URL-encoded). This information is concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with query parameters constructed from obfuscated variable names and package identifiers. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding for data exfiltration, automatic execution during installation, and sending host-identifying information to an external server are hallmark indicators of malicious behavior, specifically data exfiltration and potential supply chain attack. There is no legitimate user interaction, notification, or business logic justifying this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
