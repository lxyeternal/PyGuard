      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated, base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious payloads. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists, and if not, it launches this hidden PowerShell command, which strongly suggests it is trying to execute a payload or perform actions without user consent or notification. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the window further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the presence of a try-except block suppresses any errors, which is typical in malware to avoid raising suspicion. The setup() call with a suspicious package name and version appears to be a decoy or a way to disguise the malicious code within a package installation script, a common supply chain attack vector. Overall, the obfuscated PowerShell command execution in a hidden window, combined with the lack of legitimate user interaction or notification, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior."
