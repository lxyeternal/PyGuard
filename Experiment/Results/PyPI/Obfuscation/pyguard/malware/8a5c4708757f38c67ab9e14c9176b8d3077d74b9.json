      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/997534165178269716/999721847413288990/trex.exe) without any user interaction or consent, writes it to the current working directory as 'launcher.exe', immediately executes it via os.system, and then deletes the file. This sequence of automated remote file retrieval, writing, execution, and deletion is a classic hallmark of malware behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification, and the executable is run silently. The use of a Discord CDN URL to host the executable further suggests an attacker-controlled payload delivery mechanism. According to the provided knowledge points, this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
