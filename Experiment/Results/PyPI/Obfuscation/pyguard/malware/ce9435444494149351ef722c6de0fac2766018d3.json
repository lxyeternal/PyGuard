      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and a hardcoded string, then encodes this information in base64. It then obfuscates this encoded data by converting it to hex and splitting it into chunks, which are sent as subdomain prefixes in ping commands to a suspicious domain 'deliverycontent.online'. This is a covert channel for data exfiltration. Furthermore, the code makes multiple HTTP requests (GET and POST) to the same suspicious domain, sending the encoded system information as parameters or POST data. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, hex encoding, chunking), the collection of environment and user data without consent, the use of shell commands to ping attacker-controlled domains, and the network communication to suspicious hardcoded URLs are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction or business logic, and the code attempts to silently exfiltrate system information to an external server. These behaviors align with known malware patterns for information stealing and covert data exfiltration."
