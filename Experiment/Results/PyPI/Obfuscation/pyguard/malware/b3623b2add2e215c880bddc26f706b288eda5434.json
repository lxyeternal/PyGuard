      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command class that overrides the install process to execute a function during package installation. This function reads the system uptime from '/proc/uptime', collects detailed system information including OS release, system name, version, platform, and the local IP address. It then constructs a string combining this information and establishes a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090, sending the collected data without any user consent or notification. The obfuscated function and variable names, the execution of network communication during installation, and the exfiltration of system information to a suspicious hardcoded IP address are strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks where code execution and data exfiltration occur during package installation, a known malware vector. There is no legitimate business logic or user interaction, and the code attempts to stealthily collect and transmit sensitive environment data, which aligns with typical malware characteristics."
