      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection. The use of subprocess.Popen with CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is obfuscated, preventing immediate understanding of its intent, which is a hallmark of malicious code. Additionally, the code is embedded in a try-except block that suppresses any errors, a common evasion technique. The setup() call with a suspicious package name and version appears benign but may be a decoy or part of a supply chain attack vector. Overall, the presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution in a hidden window without user interaction or notification strongly indicates malicious intent."
