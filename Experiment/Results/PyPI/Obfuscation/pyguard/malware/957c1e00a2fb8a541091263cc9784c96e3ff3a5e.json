      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically executes obfuscated Python code via exec on a string constructed from character codes, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware. The decoded code imports numerous packages commonly associated with malware and information stealing (e.g., requests, socket, shutil, winreg, pycaw, browser_history, pycryptodome, browser_cookie3). It then performs a network request to a suspicious hardcoded URL (https://pastebin.pl/view/raw/e0db51a5) to fetch code, writes this code to a file named 'WindowsDefender.py' in the user's home directory, executes it in a hidden window, and then deletes the file. This sequence of downloading, writing, executing, and deleting code without user consent is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for payload delivery or remote code execution. Additionally, the code runs a setup function that installs a package named 'pyfastdownload' from a suspicious GitHub repository, which is unrelated to the apparent functionality and may be used for further malicious actions. The entire operation is triggered automatically during package setup without user interaction, indicating a supply chain attack vector. These behaviors—code obfuscation, remote code fetching and execution, stealth execution, and automatic triggering during installation—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
