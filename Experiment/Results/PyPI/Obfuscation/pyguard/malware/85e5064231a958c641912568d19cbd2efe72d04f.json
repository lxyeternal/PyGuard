      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and stealthily executing potentially malicious PowerShell commands. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to evade detection or repeated runs. The subprocess is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. Additionally, the code is embedded within a try-except block that suppresses any errors, a common evasion technique. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspicious package metadata, which may be used as a disguise or to facilitate execution during package installation. The presence of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and lack of user interaction or notification strongly indicate malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware payload delivery during package installation."
