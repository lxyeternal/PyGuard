      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses the 'browser_cookie3' library to stealthily extract '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from various browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) without user consent. These cookies are sensitive authentication tokens for Roblox accounts. The code then validates the stolen cookie and, if valid, collects extensive user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, creation date, and profile images using the 'robloxpy' API. It also retrieves the victim's public IP address via an external service. All this sensitive data, including the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie itself, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (stored in the obfuscated variable 'KxFYjtMjKlXabHrSExMlKDaTSgtrSlGG'). The code performs these actions automatically without any user interaction or notification, indicating covert data theft. The obfuscated variable and function names, combined with the automated collection and exfiltration of authentication tokens and personal account data, align with known patterns of credential-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to steal Roblox account credentials and related user information for unauthorized use or further exploitation."
