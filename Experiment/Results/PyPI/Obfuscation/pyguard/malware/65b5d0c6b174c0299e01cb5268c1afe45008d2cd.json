      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects extensive system information including OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, network configuration ('ifconfig' or 'ipconfig'), public IP address (via 'curl ifconfig.me'), current user ('whoami'), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of system and user data without user consent or notification is a hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector where code executes during package installation to silently collect and leak environment details. The obfuscated class and variable names, the use of shell commands to gather environment data, and the direct network transmission to an external hardcoded endpoint during install time strongly indicate malicious intent."
