      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64-encoded payloads that are decoded and immediately executed via exec(), a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The code executes different payloads depending on the operating system, with the Windows branch decoding and running a large base64 string that likely contains malicious shell commands or binaries. The Linux branch similarly decodes and executes obfuscated code that performs network communication, environment reconnaissance, and possibly data exfiltration. The code is embedded in a setup.py installation script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. The decoded payloads include network requests to suspicious endpoints, file system manipulations, and spawning of subprocesses with obfuscated commands. There is no legitimate user interaction or notification, and the code attempts to evade detection by running in background or hidden modes. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as credential theft, remote code execution, and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is conclusively malicious."
