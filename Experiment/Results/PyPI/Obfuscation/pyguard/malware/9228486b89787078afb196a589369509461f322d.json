It writes this executable to a temporary file and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern—automatic download and execution of a remote binary during package setup—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often seen in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The obfuscated variable names and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."

This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware that fetches and runs potentially untrusted or malicious payloads from remote sources. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before execution. The use of a temporary file with a randomized name and direct execution of a downloaded binary strongly indicates malicious intent, as it enables remote code execution and potential system compromise. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as automated file download and execution, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, lack of user consent, and immediate spawning of a potentially harmful process."
