      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports base64 and marshal modules and immediately executes a decoded and unmarshalled payload using exec(marshal.loads(base64.b64decode(...))). This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it uses obfuscation (base64 encoding) combined with dynamic code execution (exec on unmarshalled data). Such techniques are almost exclusively used by malware to conceal payloads and evade static detection. The decoded payload likely contains further malicious code that is hidden from static analysis. The use of marshal to serialize code objects and then execute them dynamically is a hallmark of malware, as it allows execution of arbitrary code without revealing it in plain text. Given the absence of any benign context, user interaction, or legitimate business logic, and the presence of this obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern, the code is highly likely to be malicious."
