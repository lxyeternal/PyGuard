      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a setup script that hooks into the installation/build process on Windows platforms to perform unauthorized modifications to the user's environment. It attempts to install the 'pypiwin32' package if missing, then creates a hidden Chrome extension in the user's APPDATA directory under 'Extension'. This extension injects obfuscated JavaScript code that manipulates the clipboard by replacing cryptocurrency addresses with attacker-controlled ones, a classic clipboard hijacking technique used to steal cryptocurrency transactions. The script then searches common user shortcut locations (Start Menu, Taskbar pinned items, Desktop, and if admin, ProgramData Start Menu) for shortcuts to popular browsers (chrome.exe, msedge.exe, brave.exe, launcher.exe) and modifies their command-line arguments to load the malicious extension silently on browser startup. This behavior is a strong indicator of malware aiming for persistence and stealthy cryptocurrency theft. The use of obfuscated JavaScript, writing files to system/user directories without user consent, modifying shortcuts to inject malicious payloads, and clipboard hijacking are all hallmark malicious behaviors. There is no legitimate reason for such actions during package installation, and the code lacks user notification or consent, confirming its malicious intent."
