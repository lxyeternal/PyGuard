      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed to the '-EncodedCommand' parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The process is launched with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, indicating stealth execution without user notification. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The base64-encoded PowerShell command likely contains further malicious instructions, such as downloading or executing payloads, or performing system reconnaissance or data exfiltration. Additionally, the use of try/except blocks suppresses errors, which is a common evasion technique. The subsequent call to setup() with a suspicious package name and version appears to be a decoy or an attempt to disguise the malicious code within a package installation script, a known supply chain attack vector. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process creation, conditional execution, and embedding within a setup script strongly indicates malicious behavior."
