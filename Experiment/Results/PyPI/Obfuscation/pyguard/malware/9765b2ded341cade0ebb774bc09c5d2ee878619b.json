      "malicious_behavior": "The code establishes a network connection to a hardcoded external IP address (3.228.3.164) on port 80 and redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket. It then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/bash) attached to this socket, effectively creating a reverse shell. This allows the remote host to execute arbitrary commands on the victim machine without user interaction or consent. The environment variable HISTFILE is set to /dev/null to prevent command history logging, indicating an attempt to evade detection. Such behavior is a classic hallmark of remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors, enabling unauthorized remote control and command execution. There is no legitimate user interaction, no validation, and no benign context for this code, making it strongly malicious."
