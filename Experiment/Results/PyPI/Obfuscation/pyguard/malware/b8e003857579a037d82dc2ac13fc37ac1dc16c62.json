      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that registers an atexit handler function. This handler function, executed automatically at program exit (which includes installation completion), performs several suspicious actions without user consent or notification: it creates/appends a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with the text 'proof bug by kotko' in the current directory, then silently collects system environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the script's directory (URL-encoded). It then encodes this collected information as a base64 string and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain 'https://kotko.org' with a crafted query parameter. This sequence of environment discovery, data encoding, and silent exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server during package installation is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names and the lack of any legitimate user interaction or business logic further support the conclusion that this code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate sensitive system information during installation, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
