      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command, which is executed silently (hidden window style) without user interaction or notification. The presence of the subprocess call with CREATE_NO_WINDOW and the encoded PowerShell command strongly indicates stealthy execution of potentially harmful or unauthorized actions. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching the PowerShell process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to evade repeated detection or to stage further payloads. The use of distutils.setup with a suspicious package name and version, wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses errors, further suggests an attempt to disguise malicious activity within a package installation context. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as code obfuscation, stealth execution, and abuse of installation hooks for executing hidden payloads. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
