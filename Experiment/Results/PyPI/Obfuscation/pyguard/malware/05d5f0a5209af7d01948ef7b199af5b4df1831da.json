      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide the true intent of the PowerShell command. The subprocess is launched only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or detected runs. The PowerShell command is run with the window style set to hidden and the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, which suppresses any visible window, a common stealth technique in malware. The use of base64-encoded PowerShell commands executed silently is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, often used for downloading, executing further payloads, or performing unauthorized system actions without user consent or notification. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The try/except blocks suppress any errors, further indicating an attempt to evade detection or analysis. Overall, these factors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package installation."
