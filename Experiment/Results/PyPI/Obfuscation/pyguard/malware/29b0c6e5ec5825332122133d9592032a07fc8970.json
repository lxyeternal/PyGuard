      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code imports numerous modules commonly used in malware, including pyperclip, threading, requests, httpx, winreg, win32crypt, and Crypto.Cipher.AES, which are often leveraged for credential theft, clipboard hijacking, and encrypted payload execution. The code contains a large obfuscated payload that is decompressed and executed dynamically using marshal.loads and lzma.decompress, a classic and strong indicator of malicious intent as it hides the true nature of the executed code. This multi-layered decompression and execution pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is used to evade static detection and analysis. The presence of imports like win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData suggests attempts to decrypt Windows credentials or sensitive data. The obfuscation and immediate execution of decompressed code without any user interaction or validation strongly indicate that the code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads, potentially including data exfiltration, credential theft, or remote code execution. Given these factors and the absence of any benign context or legitimate application logic, this code is conclusively malicious."
