      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary file named 'node' from a suspicious external URL (https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node) and writes it to the /tmp directory without any user consent or validation. It then attempts to execute this downloaded binary with elevated permissions (chmod +x) and runs it with a configuration file '.gitler' (which is created empty here). This behavior is a classic pattern of malware: downloading and executing untrusted code from a remote source during package installation. The execution occurs automatically when the script runs, without user interaction or notification. The use of an obscure function name and the execution of shell commands in the setup script context further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. Such behavior is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and remote code execution, making this code malicious."
