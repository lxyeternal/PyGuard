      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with an obfuscated (Base64-encoded) command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true nature of the executed command and runs it stealthily (hidden window). The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this process, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess to run PowerShell with encoded commands is a well-known malware technique for stealthy code execution, privilege escalation, or downloading/executing further payloads. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation without user consent. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution in the install context is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
