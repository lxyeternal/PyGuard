      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string passed via the -EncodedCommand parameter. This encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user interaction or notification, running in a hidden window (CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade detection or avoid repeated execution. The use of base64 encoding to hide the PowerShell command, the hidden execution, and the lack of any legitimate context or user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks where malicious code executes during package installation. The combination of obfuscation, hidden execution, and execution during setup strongly suggests this code is designed to execute unauthorized or harmful actions on the host system."
