      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using eval, base64 decoding, and string encoding techniques. It dynamically imports and executes code that is base64-decoded and then decompressed. The code uses eval on dynamically decoded and decompressed data, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscation and dynamic execution pattern is typical of malware that hides its payload to evade detection. The code also appears to decode and execute a large embedded payload, which is a common technique for delivering and running malicious code. There is no indication of legitimate user interaction or benign purpose. Such behavior aligns with known malicious patterns including code obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise."
