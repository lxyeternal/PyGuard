      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a base64-encoded, encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable and class names, the use of encrypted payloads executed without user consent, and the execution triggered automatically during package installation strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also specifies setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting that the package is designed to execute hidden malicious code during installation on Windows systems."
