      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), the current working directory (via os.getcwd()), and the username of the current user (via getpass.getuser()). It then sends this collected information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain 'http://5r13v9.ceye.io'. This behavior constitutes automated, silent collection and exfiltration of system and user information without user consent or legitimate purpose. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Executing such network communication during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious activity. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with credential or environment data theft and exfiltration."
