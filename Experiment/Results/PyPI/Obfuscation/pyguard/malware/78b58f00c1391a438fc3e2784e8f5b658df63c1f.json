      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is immediately decoded and executed via exec, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. The decoded payload performs multiple suspicious actions: it accesses the current user's AppData Roaming Microsoft Windows Startup Programs directory, writes PowerShell scripts (.vbs and .pyw) that set and run hidden PowerShell commands, including encoded commands that likely download and execute further payloads from hardcoded external URLs (e.g., https://api-hw.com/dl/runtime and https://api-hw.com/dl/w). It also runs these scripts and executables in hidden windows, indicating stealthy execution. The code uses subprocess to run PowerShell with encoded commands, writes files to startup folders to achieve persistence, and downloads and executes remote code without user consent. The package setup metadata uses obfuscated variable names and suspicious package naming, which is typical in supply chain attacks. These behaviors—dynamic execution of obfuscated code, writing to startup folders, downloading and executing remote payloads, and running hidden PowerShell commands—are hallmark characteristics of malware, specifically credential stealers or remote access trojans. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The import statement 'from pyrequester.requester import send' references a module named 'pyrequester', which is a suspicious and non-standard package name that resembles a typo or mimicry of legitimate packages like 'requests'. Such typosquatted or suspicious package names are a known indicator of malicious intent. The imported function 'send' suggests network communication capability, which combined with the suspicious package name, raises a high risk of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or command and control communication. Given the extensive knowledge points, the presence of this import alone is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially since 'pyrequester' is not a recognized legitimate library and may be used to stealthily send data or commands without user consent."
