      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to spawn a hidden PowerShell process using subprocess.Popen with a base64-encoded command string. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. The PowerShell is launched with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag and the encoded command is passed via '-EncodedCommand', a known obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. This pattern of spawning PowerShell with encoded commands in a hidden window is a well-known hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for stealthy execution, privilege escalation, or downloading and executing further payloads. The use of try/except blocks to suppress errors and the lack of any user interaction or notification further supports malicious intent. The subsequent call to setup() with a suspicious package name and version appears to be a decoy or an attempt to disguise the script as a legitimate package setup script, which is a common tactic in supply chain attacks. Overall, the combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, stealth process spawning, and suspicious packaging strongly indicates malicious behavior."
