      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads the first line starting with 'VERSION' from the file 'src/graceful/__init__.py', splits it on '=', and then passes the right-hand side directly to eval(). This is a critical risk pattern: dynamic code execution (eval) on data read from a file, with no input validation or sanitization. This enables arbitrary code execution if an attacker can modify the __init__.py file (e.g., via a supply chain attack or malicious package update). The use of obfuscated variable names further increases suspicion. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it allows code execution during package installation or setup, potentially compromising the system.",
