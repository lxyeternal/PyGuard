      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line (os.system('rm -vrf ./build ./dist ./*.pyc ./*.tgz ./*.egg-info')) is a common pattern in Python package setup scripts for cleaning up build artifacts. This command deletes local build directories and temporary files generated during packaging and installation, which is standard practice in many open-source projects. The command does not target sensitive system directories, user data, or perform any network operations, code injection, or exfiltration. There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, or dynamic code execution beyond this cleanup operation. The rest of the code is consistent with a typical setuptools-based setup script, albeit with obfuscated variable names. Therefore, this is a false positive: the code is benign and the flagged behavior is standard for package maintenance.",
