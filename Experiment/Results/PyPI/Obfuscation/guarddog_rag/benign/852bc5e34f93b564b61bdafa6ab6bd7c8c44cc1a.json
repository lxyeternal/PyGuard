      "false_positive_reason": "The code implements a Telegram bot client that interacts with the official Telegram Bot API (https://api.telegram.org/bot{token}/). It provides functions to poll for messages, send messages, and persist the last update ID in a local JSON file. There is no evidence of system information collection, credential theft, code execution, or exfiltration of sensitive data to unauthorized endpoints. The use of the Telegram API is legitimate for bot communication, and the code does not perform any hidden or obfuscated actions, nor does it interact with sensitive system resources. The obfuscated variable and function names are unusual but do not, by themselves, indicate malicious intent. The flagged 'shady-links' detection is a false positive, as the Telegram API endpoint is a well-known, legitimate service.",
