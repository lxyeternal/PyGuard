      "false_positive_reason": "The code defines a class for embedding generation using the Together API, with a hardcoded API base URL (https://api.together.xyz/v1/). While the security tool flagged the presence of a hardcoded external URL as potentially malicious, this is a common and benign pattern in SDKs and API wrappers for third-party services. The code does not collect or exfiltrate system/user information, execute dynamic or remote code, or perform any obfuscated or suspicious operations. All network communication is directed to a legitimate, documented API endpoint for a known service (Together AI). There is no evidence of credential theft, privilege escalation, persistence mechanisms, or other hallmarks of malware. The obfuscated variable names are likely the result of automated code generation or obfuscation for intellectual property reasons, not for malicious intent. The code structure, imports, and logic are consistent with standard usage in machine learning and NLP libraries.",
