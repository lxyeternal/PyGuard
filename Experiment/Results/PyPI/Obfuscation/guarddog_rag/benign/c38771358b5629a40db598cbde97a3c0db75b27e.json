The only 'shady-links' detection is the hardcoded API base URL (https://api.together.xyz/v1/), which is the official endpoint for the Together API. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, credential theft, or other malicious behaviors. The code does not collect or transmit system/user information beyond what is required for the intended API interaction. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not, by themselves, indicate maliciousness. All network communication is directed to a known, legitimate service for its documented purpose. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
