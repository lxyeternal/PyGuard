The commands executed are static, well-known, and not derived from user input or external sources. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, data exfiltration, or network communication. The code structure, context (setup.py-like script), and use of standard libraries and tools are consistent with benign, open-source development practices. The use of subprocess here is for legitimate automation of test and lint workflows, not for arbitrary or malicious code execution. No suspicious imports, obfuscated payloads, or external communication are present. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
