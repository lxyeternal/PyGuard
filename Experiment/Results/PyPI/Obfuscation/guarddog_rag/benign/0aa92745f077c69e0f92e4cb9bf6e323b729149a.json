There is clear user interaction, notification, and logging before clipboard access. There is no evidence of exfiltration, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or other suspicious behaviors. Clipboard access in this context is a documented, user-facing feature, not a stealthy or automated data theft operation. The code structure, use of standard libraries, and presence of user prompts all support a benign, utility-focused intent.",
