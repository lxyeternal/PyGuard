      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged lines execute 'make clean' and 'make library -j 4' in a subdirectory named 'frotz' during the setup process. This is a common and benign pattern in Python packages that include native code or C/C++ extensions, where a Makefile is used to build required shared libraries (e.g., 'libfrotz.so'). The commands are static, do not involve user or environment data, do not download or execute remote code, and do not exfiltrate information. There is no evidence of obfuscation, privilege escalation, or data exfiltration. The use of subprocess here is for legitimate build automation, not for malicious purposes. This pattern is frequently observed in open-source projects that wrap native libraries. Therefore, the tool's detection is a false positive.",
