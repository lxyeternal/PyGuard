The code does not exfiltrate sensitive user or system data; it only sends the year, month, and a service key (API key) to the API endpoint, which is expected for this use case. The obfuscated variable names may trigger suspicion, but there is no evidence of credential theft, code execution, or data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. The code does not read or transmit sensitive files, user information, or environment details beyond the API key, which is standard for such API calls. The endpoint is a legitimate government service, not a suspicious or attacker-controlled domain. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
