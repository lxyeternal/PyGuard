      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line uses subprocess.check_output(['mecab-config', '--libs-only-L']) to check for MeCab library paths, which is a standard and benign operation in Python packages that interface with MeCab (a Japanese morphological analyzer). The command is static, does not use user input, does not exfiltrate data, and is not used to execute arbitrary or downloaded code. The subprocess call is used for environment detection and dependency management, which is common in setup scripts for Python packages that need to interface with system-level libraries. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, privilege escalation, code injection, or other malicious behaviors. The rest of the code is a typical setuptools.setup() invocation for a Python package, with no suspicious network activity, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution. The use of subprocess in this context is well-documented in open-source projects and is not inherently malicious.",
