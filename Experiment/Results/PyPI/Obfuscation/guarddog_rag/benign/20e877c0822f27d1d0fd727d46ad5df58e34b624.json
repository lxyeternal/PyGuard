There is no evidence of exfiltration of sensitive system or user data, dynamic code execution, obfuscation for evasion, or interaction with suspicious or non-corporate domains. The code does not collect or transmit host-specific information, nor does it perform any actions typical of malware (such as persistence, privilege escalation, or credential theft). The use of obfuscated variable names is likely due to code obfuscation or minification, but the logic and endpoints remain consistent with legitimate Discord bot functionality. Therefore, the security tool's detection is a false positive, likely triggered by the presence of external URLs, but these URLs are official Discord endpoints and not inherently suspicious.",
