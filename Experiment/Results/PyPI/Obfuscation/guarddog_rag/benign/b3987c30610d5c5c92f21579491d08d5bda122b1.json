      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line uses subprocess.check_output(['mecab-config', '--libs-only-L']) to query the system for MeCab library paths, which is a standard and benign practice in Python packages that interface with native libraries. The command is static, does not use user input, does not execute arbitrary code, and does not transmit data externally. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, privilege escalation, or other malicious behaviors. The code is part of a setup script for a legitimate open-source NLP package (udkanbun), and the subprocess call is used solely for environment detection and dependency management. This pattern is common in benign open-source projects that need to detect system library locations during installation.",
