The URL is used in a help string to provide users with additional documentation about available options for a command-line tool, which is a common and benign practice. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, obfuscated payloads, or any of the high-risk behaviors outlined in the knowledge points. The code is structured as a typical command-line argument parser, and the use of a shortened URL for documentation is not, by itself, a sign of malicious intent. No network operations, credential access, or system modifications are present. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
