      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged line uses eval() to parse the __version__ tuple from a local __init__.py file, which is a common (though not ideal) pattern in some Python packaging scripts. The code does not read from user input, network, or untrusted sources; it only reads a static version string from a local file within the package. There is no evidence of code injection, obfuscation, data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or any other malicious behavior. The use of eval() here is risky from a best-practices perspective, but not malicious in this context. The rest of the script is a standard setup.py pattern for packaging a Python module. The detection is a false positive due to the presence of eval(), but the context and data source are benign.",
