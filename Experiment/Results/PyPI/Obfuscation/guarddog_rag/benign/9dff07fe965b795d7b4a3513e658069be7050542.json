The function 'copy' is defined as:\n\ndef copy(vaJvYMvYOxaXjopWXNqjPsWMEwWfkTBk: str):\n    import pyperclip\n    pyperclip.copy(vaJvYMvYOxaXjopWXNqjPsWMEwWfkTBk)\n\nThis is a direct wrapper around pyperclip's copy function, which is a common utility in automation and productivity scripts. There is no evidence of exfiltration, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or any of the other high-risk behaviors associated with malware. The codebase, while heavily obfuscated in naming, does not demonstrate any attempt to steal clipboard data, send it to a remote server, or perform any action without user interaction. Clipboard access alone is not inherently malicious; it is only a risk when combined with data exfiltration or credential theft, which is not present here. Therefore, the security tool's flag is a false positive.",
