      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It makes POST requests to hardcoded, suspicious IP addresses (http://157.136.253.53:24000/reaction/new, /user/signup, /user/signin) that are not associated with any known legitimate service or business logic. These endpoints are used for user registration, authentication, and uploading 'reactions', but the context and naming are obfuscated and do not match any well-known API or open-source project. The code collects data from Telegram and Slack channels, processes it, and sends it to these external servers without user notification or consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of documentation, and the presence of suspicious endpoints are all hallmarks of malware. There is no clear, legitimate business logic for sending this data to these endpoints, and the code could be exfiltrating sensitive information or acting as part of a command-and-control infrastructure. The use of requests.post with hardcoded IPs, especially in combination with credential-like data (usernames, passwords, tokens), is a classic exfiltration and C2 pattern. The code also deserializes responses from these endpoints and uses them for further processing, which could enable remote code execution or further compromise. All these factors, combined with the detection tool's findings, strongly indicate malicious intent.",
