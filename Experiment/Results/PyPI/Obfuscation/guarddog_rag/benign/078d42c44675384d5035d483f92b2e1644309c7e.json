      "false_positive_reason": "The code is a (heavily obfuscated) implementation of launching a Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) to expose a local service to the internet. The flagged line uses a regex to extract a public tunnel URL (ending in .trycloudflare.com) from the local cloudflared metrics endpoint, which is standard for such tunneling tools. The code does not exfiltrate system/user data, execute arbitrary code from untrusted sources, or contact suspicious domains outside of the official Cloudflare infrastructure. All downloads are from the official Cloudflare GitHub releases. The obfuscation is suspicious, but the overall logic matches legitimate use cases for exposing local services (e.g., for development or remote access). No evidence of credential theft, persistence, or data exfiltration is present. The detection is a false positive due to the presence of a regex for a public tunnel URL, which is expected in this context.",
