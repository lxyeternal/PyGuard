      "false_positive_reason": "The flagged code is a custom setuptools build_ext command that invokes 'make' to build a static library ('build/libminiupnpc.a') as part of the package build process. This is a common and legitimate pattern in Python packages that include native extensions or require pre-built C libraries. The subprocess call is not obfuscated, does not execute arbitrary or user-supplied code, does not interact with the network, and does not perform any data exfiltration or privilege escalation. The use of non-descriptive variable and class names is unusual but not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of code injection, dynamic code execution, or other high-risk behaviors. The subprocess command is static and limited to building a local artifact, which is a standard practice in many open-source projects. Therefore, this is a false positive.",
