This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is exclusively observed in malware samples. It downloads and immediately executes arbitrary code from a remote, untrusted source (Pastebin), enabling remote code execution on the user's system without their knowledge or consent. This is a critical risk, as it allows an attacker to run any code of their choosing, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or further malware installation. The use of eval on remote content, especially in a setup script, is never justified in benign software and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
