This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution, especially in the context of a setup script (suggesting a supply chain attack vector). The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive function and variable names, lacks any user notification, error handling, or legitimate business logic, and is triggered automatically upon import or installation. The use of requests to fetch a remote binary and immediate execution without validation or user consent is strongly associated with malware and is never seen in benign software. The suspicious package name and the context of execution during setup further elevate the risk.",
