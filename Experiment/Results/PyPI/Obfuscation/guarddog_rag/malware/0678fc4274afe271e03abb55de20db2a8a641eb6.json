      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (webhook.site), which is not associated with any legitimate service or business logic. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the absence of user notification or consent, and the execution of this logic during installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never seen in benign software. The code is designed to run automatically upon installation, making it a critical supply chain risk.",
