      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (in the setup.py context) if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and passed to the '-EncodedCommand' argument, a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), and writes/executes files in user directories (e.g., Windows Startup folder). The use of subprocess.Popen with hidden window flags, obfuscated command, and error suppression (try/except pass) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks targeting Python package installations.",
