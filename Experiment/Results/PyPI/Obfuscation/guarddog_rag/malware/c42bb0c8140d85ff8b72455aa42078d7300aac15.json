It defines a custom setuptools install command (xQlKloXjIVJgIWsHqncfRTqWryPIbxHQ) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the decrypted code is hidden from static analysis, and arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during install time are all strong indicators of malware, especially in the context of a Python package setup script. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages.",
