If found, it copies this directory to a temporary location, compresses it into a zip archive, and then exfiltrates the archive by sending it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded external webhook, targeting of sensitive application data, and lack of user notification or consent are all strong indicators of information-stealing malware. The code also suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and ensure execution. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never justified in benign software.",
