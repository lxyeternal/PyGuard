      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious commands on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious URL (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will run automatically during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
