      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, writes a Python file ('code.py') to the system's temporary directory and then immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call(['python', ...]). The written file ('code.py') contains 'import dshttpslib', which could trigger the import of an arbitrary or malicious module if present in the environment or installed as a dependency. This pattern—executing arbitrary code during installation via a dynamically written file—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, lack of user notification or consent, and execution of code at install time further elevate the risk. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the target system without user knowledge, which is a critical security risk.",
