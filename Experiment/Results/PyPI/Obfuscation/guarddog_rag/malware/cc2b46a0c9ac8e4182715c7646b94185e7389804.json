      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated, with meaningless variable and function names, and uses dynamic code execution via exec and eval on dynamically constructed or potentially decompressed/decoded payloads. Specifically, the code defines several lambda functions that use __import__('zlib'), eval, and compile, and then executes code from globals()['globals()[...](...)'], which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. There are also large, suspicious byte strings (likely compressed or encrypted payloads) that are written to globals and then executed. The code uses indirect references to built-in functions and modules, and the execution chain is intentionally convoluted to evade detection. The presence of hardcoded, obfuscated payloads, dynamic code execution, and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality are all hallmarks of Python malware, especially those seen in supply chain attacks or malicious PyPI packages. The code also suppresses exceptions, further hiding its true behavior. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
