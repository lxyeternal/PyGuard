      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (via setup.py). Specifically, it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it launches a PowerShell process with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The command is base64-encoded, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and running it. This enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides malicious activity. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
