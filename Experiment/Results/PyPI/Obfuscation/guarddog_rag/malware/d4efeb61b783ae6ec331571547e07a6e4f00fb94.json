      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as the actual PowerShell command is hidden from static analysis and user inspection. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), and writes it to a location in the user's home directory (potentially for persistence or further compromise). This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks where code is executed during package installation (as seen here in a setup.py context). There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior.",
