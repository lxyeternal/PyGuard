      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the package installation process (in the setup.py context). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the payload. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then running it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, often used in supply chain attacks to compromise systems during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the check for a non-descriptive file ('tahg'), and the lack of any legitimate business logic further confirm the malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware targeting Windows systems.",
