This pattern is a hallmark of malware: it enables remote code execution, downloads and runs untrusted code from an external source, and does so without user consent or notification. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute automatically during package installation, making it a supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner. The use of a non-corporate, public file-sharing service (Dropbox) for payload delivery further increases suspicion. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and is never seen in benign software.",
