      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (InstallCommand) that, during package installation, reconstructs an obfuscated payload by XOR-decoding a long, opaque string using another string as a key. The decoded payload is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(..., 'exec')), which enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system at install time. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The use of obfuscated variable names, encoded payloads, and dynamic code execution during installation, combined with the suppression of all exceptions (try/except: pass), is a classic technique for hiding and delivering malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior.",
