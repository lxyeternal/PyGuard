      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command, once decoded, appears to download and execute a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks via Python package installation scripts. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote binaries in this manner.",
