This function is called immediately after the setup() function, meaning it will execute as soon as the script runs, including during package installation. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, where arbitrary code is executed on the user's system during installation. The use of a hardcoded, suspicious URL, lack of user interaction or notification, and execution of a shell command to download remote content are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this action.",
