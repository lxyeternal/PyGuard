      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, commonly seen in malware and supply chain attacks. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its behavior. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe', and then invokes them. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is embedded in a setup script, so it will run automatically during package installation, potentially compromising any system that installs the package. All of these behaviors—obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, hidden process creation, and execution during installation—are strong, exclusive indicators of malware.",
