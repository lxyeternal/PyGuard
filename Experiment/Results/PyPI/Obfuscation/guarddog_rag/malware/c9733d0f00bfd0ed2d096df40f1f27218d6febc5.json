It then immediately executes this file using os.system('start ...'). This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary without user consent, validation, or notification—is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, further increasing the risk of automated compromise. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of error handling, and absence of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality further support the assessment that this is malicious code.",
