      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious commands on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and running it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is embedded in a setup script, so it will execute during package installation, potentially compromising any system where the package is installed. All of these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, remote payload download and execution, error suppression, and execution during installation—are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
