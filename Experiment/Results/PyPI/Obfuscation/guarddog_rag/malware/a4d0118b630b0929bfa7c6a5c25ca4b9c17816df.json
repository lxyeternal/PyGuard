There is no evidence of data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or interaction with suspicious domains. The code is part of a well-known open-source Discord library, contains extensive documentation, and does not perform any actions associated with malware (such as sending data to external servers, executing shell commands, or manipulating sensitive files). The security tool likely flagged this due to the presence of a hardcoded URL, but in this context, it is benign and expected.",
