      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (YjfArYnCCcAZRmEqheMTmKtqZGIYonuY) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'). If so, it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only executed on Windows, and runs automatically during installation without user consent. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic code execution, and obfuscated class/function names are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload at install time.",
