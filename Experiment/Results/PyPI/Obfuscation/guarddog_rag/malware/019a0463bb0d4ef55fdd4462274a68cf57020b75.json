      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and running it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is embedded in a setup script, so it will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. All of these behaviors—obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, error suppression, and execution during installation—are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
