      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the installation/setup phase (via distutils.core.setup). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the payload. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and likely executes them. The use of try/except to suppress all errors, the check for a non-descriptive directory ('tahg'), and the lack of user notification or consent are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, enabling remote code execution, persistence, and potential data exfiltration.",
