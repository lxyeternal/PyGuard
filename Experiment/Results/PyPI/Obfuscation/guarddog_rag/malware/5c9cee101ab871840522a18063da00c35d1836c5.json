      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command, once decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a location in the user's home directory and executing it. The use of try/except blocks to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Embedding this logic in a setup script means it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
