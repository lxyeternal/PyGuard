The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a long base64 string is a hallmark of malware, as it hides the true intent of the command from static analysis. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a file in the user's home directory and executing it. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its activity. These patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
