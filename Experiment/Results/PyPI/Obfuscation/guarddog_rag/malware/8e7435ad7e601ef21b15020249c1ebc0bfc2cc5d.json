It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the lack of user notification or consent, and the execution of this logic during installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never seen in benign software. The code serves no legitimate business logic and is designed solely for covert data exfiltration.",
