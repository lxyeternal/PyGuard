      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation, including base64 encoding and eval/compile/exec chains, to dynamically decode and execute hidden payloads. Specifically, the code constructs a string using eval and obfuscated byte sequences, then decodes and executes additional code using base64.b64decode and compile/exec. The decoded payload (hidden in variables like AJnmlnmwFeJqUjqPcZxTYLOAolNkxBxr and others) contains further obfuscated logic, including network operations (requests to suspicious, hardcoded URLs), system information gathering, and file operations targeting potentially sensitive directories. The code is designed to evade static analysis and likely downloads or executes further malicious payloads, exfiltrates data, or establishes persistence. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation, and the patterns match those found exclusively in malware, especially supply chain attacks and information stealers.",
