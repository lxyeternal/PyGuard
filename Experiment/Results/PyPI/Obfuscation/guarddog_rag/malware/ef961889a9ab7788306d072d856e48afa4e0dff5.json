      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior: (1) It establishes a reverse shell by connecting to a hardcoded external IP address and port, redirecting standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawning a shell. (2) It collects sensitive system information (hostname, working directory, username, directory listings of /, /root, /home, /root/.ssh) and exfiltrates this data to an external, suspicious domain (https://j0j0.xyz/lists/). (3) It downloads files to the Windows AppData directory and writes a .bat file, a common persistence technique. (4) It executes arbitrary code via base64-decoded payloads using os.system and exec, including a large, obfuscated base64 payload that is dynamically decoded and executed. (5) The code is heavily obfuscated, uses misleading variable names, and suppresses exceptions to evade detection. (6) It contains no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation, and all actions are consistent with malware: remote code execution, data exfiltration, persistence, and evasion. (7) The flagged lines by the security tool (requests to shady domains, obfuscated code execution) are accurate and critical. All these behaviors are exclusive to malware and are never observed in benign software.",
