      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (CMmaFisBBcBsYyqIKLHxqTyifrseMykL) that, during package installation, downloads a Windows executable ('pics.exe') from a suspicious, hardcoded GitHub URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) and immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never seen in benign packages. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable and class names, and the download/execute logic is hidden within the install hook, ensuring it runs automatically when the package is installed. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this action. The use of requests to fetch a remote binary and subprocess to execute it, especially during installation, is a critical risk and matches multiple high-confidence malware patterns.",
