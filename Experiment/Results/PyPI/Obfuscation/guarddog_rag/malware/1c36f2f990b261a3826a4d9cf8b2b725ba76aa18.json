It defines a custom setuptools install command (NyScXCelDGvbReRslsRbxqVaZRLlKmpx) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the decrypted code is hidden from static analysis, and arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, and execution of decrypted code during install are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
