This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, making its intent opaque and likely designed to evade static analysis. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks where code is executed during package installation (as seen here, embedded in a setup.py script). The code does not provide any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the presence of obfuscated, encoded, and hidden execution is a hallmark of malicious behavior.",
