It downloads two Windows executable files from hardcoded, suspicious Discord CDN URLs, writes them to disk, moves them to a hidden/system-like directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), and then executes both files using os.startfile. The code is heavily obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names, suppresses all exceptions (hiding errors or detection), and performs these actions without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The use of a setup.py-like structure and the presence of these operations in what appears to be a package installation script further suggest a supply chain attack vector. The code also attempts to clean up traces by deleting the executables and the created directory. All of these behaviors are hallmarks of malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a Windows executable ('main.exe') from a hardcoded, suspicious Discord CDN URL, writes it to disk, moves it to a hidden/system-like directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), renames it to 'XMICNEI.exe', and then immediately executes it using os.startfile. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution: it automates the retrieval and execution of remote code, uses obfuscated variable names, targets a non-standard and hidden directory for persistence or evasion, and provides no user notification or consent. The use of Discord CDN as a payload host is a common tactic in malware campaigns. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. The code matches multiple high-confidence malicious patterns, including remote payload download and execution, use of suspicious/obfuscated paths, and lack of validation or integrity checks.",
