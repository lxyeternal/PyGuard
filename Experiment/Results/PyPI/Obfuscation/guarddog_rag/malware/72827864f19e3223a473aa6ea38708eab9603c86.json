      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive system and user information (hostname, current working directory, username, FQDN, IP address, and reverse DNS) and immediately exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (cas54n1gfihn6082nil0kz451ubndy6rt.dooracle.in) via an HTTP GET request. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, as it executes automatically during package installation without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the lack of any legitimate business logic, and the targeting of sensitive environment data for exfiltration are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of information-stealing malware.",
