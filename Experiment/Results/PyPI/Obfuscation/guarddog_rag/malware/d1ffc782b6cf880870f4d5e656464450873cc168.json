      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (pSSOAlVeaLGOINvSPaEIoDGhYQgXGDcb) that is executed automatically during package installation. (2) Within this command, it contains a large, obfuscated, XOR-encrypted payload (XvwgNHtlGoXgdsFpKevxuQmhwgSSiYJh) and a hardcoded key (hKDRwgHukqgZBEwouoQUiBPmZhaPzupc). (3) The payload is decrypted at install time, and the resulting code is immediately executed via eval(compile(...)), enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. (4) This pattern—obfuscated payload, dynamic decryption, and execution during install—is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in supply chain attacks via PyPI. (5) The code is heavily obfuscated, uses non-descriptive variable names, and provides no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality for this behavior. (6) The use of eval(compile(...)) on dynamically generated code is never seen in benign packages and is a strong indicator of malicious intent. (7) The malicious code is triggered automatically upon installation, without user interaction or consent, making it extremely dangerous.",
