      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered during package installation, collects sensitive system information: the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), the current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the current username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://9.30.214.68:9090) using the requests library. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it exfiltrates host-specific data to an attacker-controlled server without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the absence of any legitimate business logic, and the execution of this code during installation (a trusted workflow) further confirm its malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to collect and transmit this information externally.",
