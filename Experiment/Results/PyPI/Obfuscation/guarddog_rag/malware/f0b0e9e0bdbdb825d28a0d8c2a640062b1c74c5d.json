      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. 1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, hardcoded external server (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php?live=Installation ...), which is a classic system fingerprinting and data exfiltration technique. 2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), writes it to disk with a generic filename (ini_file_pyp_41.exe), and immediately executes it using os.system('start ...'), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. 3) All of this is triggered automatically during the package installation process via a custom setuptools install command, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. 4) The code uses obfuscated variable names, suppresses all exceptions (try/except: pass), and provides no user notification or consent, further indicating malicious intent and an attempt to evade detection. These behaviors are never observed in benign software and are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
