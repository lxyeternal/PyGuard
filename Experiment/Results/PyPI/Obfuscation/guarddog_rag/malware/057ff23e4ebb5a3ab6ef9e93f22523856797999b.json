This pattern is a classic indicator of malware: it enables remote code execution by fetching and running an untrusted binary without user consent, logging, or validation. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names, lacks any legitimate business logic, and is embedded in a script that could be triggered during package installation (supply chain attack vector). There is no user interaction, notification, or error handling. All these characteristics match high-confidence indicators of malicious behavior, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
