      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, specifically those associated with supply chain attacks and malware persistence. The function GWkViygaMhonDeaYzKKQevxcOmqgXLPC is designed to execute automatically during package installation (via custom setuptools install/develop hooks). It performs the following actions: (1) Contacts a suspicious, non-corporate remote server (https://stub.syntheticcc.repl.co) to retrieve a secondary URL, (2) Downloads a file from this dynamically constructed URL, (3) Writes the downloaded file as 'Update.exe' into the Windows Startup folder (using environment variables to resolve the path), and (4) Executes the file using a shell command. This achieves both remote code execution and persistence, as the file will run on every system startup. The code is heavily obfuscated, uses non-descriptive variable names, suppresses all exceptions (hiding errors or detection), and provides no user notification or consent. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software. The use of setup.py install hooks to trigger this behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector.",
