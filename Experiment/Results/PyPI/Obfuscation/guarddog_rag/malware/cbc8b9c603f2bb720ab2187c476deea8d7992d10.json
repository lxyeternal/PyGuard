      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (via setup.py). Specifically, it checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (https://github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly seen in supply chain attacks via malicious Python packages. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, and remote payload download, combined with execution during package installation, are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior.",
