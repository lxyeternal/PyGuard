      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py context). The command is run only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a classic indicator of malicious intent to hide execution from the user. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a location in the user's home directory and executing it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation, with no user interaction or notification, and the payload is both obfuscated and fetched from an external, untrusted source. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
