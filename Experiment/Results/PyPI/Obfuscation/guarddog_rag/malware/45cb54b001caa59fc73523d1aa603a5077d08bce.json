It defines a custom setuptools install command (cQkRMFPZrDXazemtdUFOAnxKagDYURGq) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only executed on Windows, and is triggered automatically during installation, without user consent or notification. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic code execution, and obfuscated variable names are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload, which could perform any arbitrary action (e.g., data exfiltration, backdoor installation, credential theft).",
