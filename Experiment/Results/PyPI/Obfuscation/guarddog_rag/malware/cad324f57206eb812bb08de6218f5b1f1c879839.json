      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, clear indicators of malicious behavior. It writes raw ELF binaries (likely compiled malware payloads) to hidden directories (/tmp/.pip/pip autoupdate and /tmp/.pip/pip cleanup), sets their permissions to executable, and then executes them in the background using subprocess.run with shell=True. The code also attempts to delete system binaries (/bin/netstat and /usr/bin/netstat), which is a classic anti-forensics or anti-analysis technique to hinder system monitoring. Furthermore, it creates .ssh/authorized_keys files in multiple user directories and injects a hardcoded SSH public key, establishing persistent unauthorized remote access (backdoor) for the attacker. The use of try/except blocks to suppress all errors is a common evasion technique. The code is embedded in a setup.py context, meaning it will execute during package installation, making it a supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
