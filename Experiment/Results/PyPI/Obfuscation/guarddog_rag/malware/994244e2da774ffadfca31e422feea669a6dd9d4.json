      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It writes a Python script to a temporary file that, when executed, downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/c24j2/raw) using exec(). This enables arbitrary remote code execution on the victim's machine. (2) The code then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system call, with obfuscated variable names and minimal error handling (try/except pass), which is a common evasion technique. (3) The malicious payload is triggered during the setup process (via setuptools), meaning it can execute automatically upon package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. (4) The use of indirect imports, obfuscated variable names, and dynamic code execution from a remote source are all strong indicators of malware. (5) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. (6) The remote URL is not a trusted or official resource, and the code fetched is executed without validation or user consent. All of these factors, especially the combination of remote code download and execution during installation, are critical risk indicators and are never observed in benign software.",
