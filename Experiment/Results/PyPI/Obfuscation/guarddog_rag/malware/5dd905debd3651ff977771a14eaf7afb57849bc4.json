      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It attempts to extract the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library, which is a classic technique for credential theft. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects additional sensitive information about the Roblox account (user ID, username, Robux balance, premium status, account age, creation date, friends count, RAP, etc.) using the robloxpy library and Roblox APIs. The code also collects the victim's public IP address via an external service (https://api.ipify.org/). All of this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie and the victim's IP address, is then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook (VCMTzrTvLAHDEoNLbshluxgmzujYZlJL). The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and provides no user notification or consent. These are all strong indicators of credential-stealing malware designed to compromise Roblox accounts and exfiltrate sensitive data to an attacker-controlled server.",
