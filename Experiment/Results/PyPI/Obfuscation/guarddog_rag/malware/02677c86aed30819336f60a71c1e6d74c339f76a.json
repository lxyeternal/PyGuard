      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware, specifically a 'cookie grabber' targeting Roblox Studio users. It programmatically accesses the Windows registry to extract the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie, which is a sensitive authentication token for Roblox accounts. The code then exfiltrates this cookie by sending it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL controlled by the attacker. The use of a hardcoded external webhook, lack of user notification or consent, and the targeting of sensitive authentication data are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code also suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and ensure stealthy operation. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality present; the sole purpose of the code is to steal and exfiltrate credentials.",
