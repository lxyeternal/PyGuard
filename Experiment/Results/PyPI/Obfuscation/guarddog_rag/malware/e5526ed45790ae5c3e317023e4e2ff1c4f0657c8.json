      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process of a Python package. Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via malicious PyPI packages. The use of obfuscated, encoded commands, hidden execution, and remote payload download and execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code is wrapped in try/except blocks to suppress errors and evade detection, and it is triggered during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks.",
