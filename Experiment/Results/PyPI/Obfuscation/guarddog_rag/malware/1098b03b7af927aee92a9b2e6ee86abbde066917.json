      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that, when triggered during package installation or development, execute a function (trfNHZgqPyYiaMkWOhKfTAWTNjzycsCL) which collects all environment variables from the victim's system (os.environ), encodes them, and attempts to send them via an HTTP request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is executed automatically during package installation, exfiltrating sensitive system information without user consent. The use of obfuscated function and class names, lack of user notification, and the presence of a suspicious external endpoint further confirm the malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of information-stealing malware.",
