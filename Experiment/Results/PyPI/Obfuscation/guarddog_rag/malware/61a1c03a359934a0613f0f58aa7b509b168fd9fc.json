      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior. 1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a hallmark of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. 2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), writes it to disk with a generic name (ini_file_pyp_32.exe), and immediately executes it via os.system('start ...'), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. 3) All of this is triggered automatically during the package installation process by hijacking the setuptools install command (via a custom cmdclass in setup()), which is a classic supply chain attack vector. 4) The code uses obfuscated variable and class names, suppresses all exceptions (try/except: pass), and provides no user notification or consent, further indicating malicious intent and an attempt to evade detection. 5) The domains and file names used are not associated with any legitimate Python package or business logic. These behaviors, especially in combination, are never observed in benign software and are strongly associated with malware, particularly supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem.",
