      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a hallmark of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. (2) It downloads a remote executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_32.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start ...'), enabling arbitrary code execution and potential system compromise. (3) All of this logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, ensuring it runs automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. (4) The code uses obfuscated variable names, suppresses all exceptions (hiding errors or detection), and provides no user notification or consent. (5) The domains and file names used are not associated with any legitimate Python or open-source infrastructure. These behaviors are never observed in benign software and match patterns seen exclusively in malware.",
