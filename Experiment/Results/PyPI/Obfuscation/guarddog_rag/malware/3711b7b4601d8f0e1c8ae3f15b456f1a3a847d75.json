It creates a temporary file and writes Python code to it that, when executed, downloads and executes additional code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/6d6ze/raw) using exec(). The code then attempts to execute this temporary file using a modified Python executable name (replacing .exe with w.exe), which is a known evasion technique. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, particularly supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary remote code execution during package installation (via setup.py). The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user interaction, and execution of remote code without validation or consent further confirm its malicious intent.",
