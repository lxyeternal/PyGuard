      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (nSfufkxpTFSdGBCOdNbZHvcoZiEoSWBA) that is executed automatically during package installation. (2) In the BvHbqCehVyQQteHfylTdxAXfzOKNoniy function, it collects sensitive host information: the external IP address (via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')), the system hostname (os.uname()[1]), and the installation path. (3) It encodes this information using base64 and sends it to a suspicious, hardcoded external server (https://kotko.org) with a non-standard query string. (4) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data exfiltration. (5) The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names and uses a non-descriptive package name, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. (6) The use of a custom install hook to trigger this behavior during installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign open-source packages.",
