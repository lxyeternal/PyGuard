      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command, once decoded, appears to download and execute a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is embedded in a setup script, so it will run automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. All these behaviors—obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, lack of user interaction, and execution during installation—are strong, exclusive indicators of malware.",
