      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits several strong indicators of malicious behavior: (1) It collects sensitive user information from a Discord account, including username, avatar, ID, email, phone, and billing information, as well as the operating system platform. (2) It sends this data to an external server via a POST request. The destination URL is obfuscated using base64 encoding and decodes to a Discord webhook, which is a common exfiltration method used by malware. (3) The code uses non-descriptive, obfuscated variable names and lacks any user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data collection and exfiltration. (4) The use of base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL is a classic obfuscation technique to evade detection. (5) The code is not part of any legitimate application logic and is solely focused on data theft and exfiltration. All these factors, especially the combination of credential and billing data theft and exfiltration to a hardcoded, obfuscated webhook, are hallmarks of information-stealing malware.",
