The command is run only if a file named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion/persistence technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which is a classic indicator of malware attempting to run without user visibility. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software.",
