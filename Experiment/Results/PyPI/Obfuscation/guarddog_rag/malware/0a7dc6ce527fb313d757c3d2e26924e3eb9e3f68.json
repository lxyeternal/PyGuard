It defines a custom setuptools install command (bqciuMFjzsOcklbumxJEHUUYmEjlHHif) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'Fernet' (from the cryptography package). It uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the decrypted code is hidden from static analysis, and arbitrary code is executed on the user's system during installation, without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during install are all strong indicators of malware, especially in the context of a Python package. This matches multiple critical risk patterns: code execution during install, obfuscation, use of cryptography for payload delivery, and lack of any legitimate business logic.",
