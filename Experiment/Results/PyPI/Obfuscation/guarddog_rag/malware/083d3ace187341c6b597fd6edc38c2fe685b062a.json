      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly obfuscated and dangerous pattern: it decodes a base64-encoded payload and immediately executes it using exec and compile, all via indirect calls through __import__('builtins'). This is a classic malware technique to hide the true intent of the code and evade static analysis. The decoded payload, when examined, downloads and executes code from a hardcoded external IP address (http://40.113.112.131/inject/8SBVnoqSQsbjlaV), writes it to a temporary file, and attempts to execute it, potentially establishing remote control or exfiltrating data. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware, especially as it is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, meaning it will run automatically during package installation. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this operation. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and external network communication to a suspicious IP address are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
