      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a hallmark of host fingerprinting and C2 communication. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start ...'), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. (3) All of this logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, ensuring it runs automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. (4) The code uses obfuscated variable names, suppresses all exceptions (hiding errors or detection), and provides no user notification or consent for any of these actions. (5) There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality present. These behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never justified in benign software, especially in the context of a Python package installation script.",
