      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious commands on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it to a hidden location and running it. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise during package installation (supply chain attack vector). The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
