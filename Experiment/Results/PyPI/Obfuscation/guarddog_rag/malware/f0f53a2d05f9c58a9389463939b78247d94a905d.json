The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a common technique in malware to hide its true intent. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote executable from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it to a hidden location and running it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during installation, uses obfuscation, suppresses all exceptions to evade detection, and downloads/executes a remote payload without user consent. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
