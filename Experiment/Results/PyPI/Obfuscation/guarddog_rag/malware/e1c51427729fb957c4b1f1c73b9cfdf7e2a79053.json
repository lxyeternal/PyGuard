      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits several critical indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand) that is executed automatically during package installation. In the run() method, it calls the app() function, which, if running on Windows, downloads an executable (DigitalPulse.exe) from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe) and immediately executes it using os.system('start ' + filename). This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary during package installation, without user consent or notification—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its activity. The package name (mxeo26lf6s6p5xkd) is non-descriptive and likely auto-generated to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. All these factors, especially the combination of remote payload delivery and execution in a setup script, are strongly associated with malware.",
