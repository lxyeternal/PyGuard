      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It collects sensitive system and user information (username via 'whoami', home directory via 'echo $HOME', and system information via platform module). (2) It exfiltrates this information to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://3.221.152.203:8000) using shell-invoked 'curl' commands, with the data embedded in the URL path. (3) The exfiltration is performed silently (output redirected to /dev/null), with no user notification, consent, or error handling. (4) The code is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, ensuring it runs automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. (5) Variable and function names are obfuscated, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. (6) There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify these actions. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
