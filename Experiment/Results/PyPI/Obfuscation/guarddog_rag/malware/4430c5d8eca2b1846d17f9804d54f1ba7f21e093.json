It creates a temporary file and writes Python code to it that, when executed, downloads and executes additional code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/m3qfu/raw) using urllib and exec. The code then attempts to execute this temporary file using a modified Python executable name (replacing .exe with w.exe), which is a known evasion technique. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware, as it enables arbitrary code from an untrusted, external source to be executed on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user interaction, and execution during setup further confirm its malicious intent.",
