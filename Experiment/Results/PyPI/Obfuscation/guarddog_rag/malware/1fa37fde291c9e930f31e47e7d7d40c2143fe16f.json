      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command via subprocess.call('py -m perlreq', shell=True) during the setup process of a Python package. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system at install time, without user consent or notification. The command 'py -m perlreq' will attempt to run the 'perlreq' module, which may not be a standard or trusted module, and could be used to download, install, or execute further malicious payloads. The use of shell=True further increases the risk, as it allows for shell injection and execution of arbitrary commands. This pattern is strongly associated with malware in the Python ecosystem, especially in malicious PyPI packages, and is rarely, if ever, justified in benign software. The package name 'nxxdq3v48puzdinn' is also non-descriptive and suspicious, further supporting the assessment of malicious intent.",
