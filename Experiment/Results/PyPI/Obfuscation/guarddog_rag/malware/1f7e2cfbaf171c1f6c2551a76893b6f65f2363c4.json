      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the behavior. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, is likely to download and execute a remote payload or perform other malicious actions. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks, as it is embedded in a setup script that would run during package installation, potentially compromising any system that installs the package. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands, especially without user notification or consent.",
