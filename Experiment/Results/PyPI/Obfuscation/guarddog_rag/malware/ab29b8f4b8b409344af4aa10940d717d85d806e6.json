      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (QVLajsZQlifFXUPfdKdEFFwSyYeGDHJz) that, when the package is installed, executes a PowerShell reverse shell command via os.system. The PowerShell command connects to a hardcoded external IP address (81.68.184.99) on port 6784, establishing a remote shell that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is triggered during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, direct shell execution, and hardcoded C2 infrastructure are all strong indicators of malware. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to open a reverse shell to an external server.",
