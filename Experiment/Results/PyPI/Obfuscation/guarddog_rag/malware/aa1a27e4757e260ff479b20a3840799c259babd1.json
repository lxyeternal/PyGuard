The command is executed via subprocess with shell=True, which allows arbitrary shell command execution. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable and function names, and there is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic. This pattern matches multiple high-confidence indicators of malware: automated data exfiltration, use of suspicious external endpoints, lack of user interaction, and obfuscation. The behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware and is not observed in benign software.",

      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command (OEmHxPcyvSSzSyVsYKFXMteeMwkOmiHJ) that overrides the installation process to execute the function RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb from a module named pre_install. This function is executed automatically during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python. The function name and module are highly obfuscated, and there is no documentation or legitimate business logic provided. The use of a custom install hook to execute arbitrary code during installation is a critical risk pattern, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the target system without user consent. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and is a common vector for malicious payload delivery in compromised or typosquatted PyPI packages.",
