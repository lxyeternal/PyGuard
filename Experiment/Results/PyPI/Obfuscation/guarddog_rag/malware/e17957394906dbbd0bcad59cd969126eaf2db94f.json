This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, making its intent opaque to static analysis and typical users. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. This code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The combination of these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, hidden process window, error suppression, and execution during installation—matches multiple high-confidence malware indicators and is never seen in benign software.",
