The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a long base64 string is a hallmark of malware, as it allows arbitrary and hidden execution of potentially harmful payloads. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks, where malicious code is executed during package installation, potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The lack of user interaction, documentation, or legitimate business logic further confirms its malicious intent.",
