      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated, using base64, zlib, and codecs to encode payloads, and employs dynamic code execution via eval and exec. The code reconstructs and executes further code from encoded/obfuscated sources, including a suspicious base64-encoded payload. It sets up indirect references to built-in functions (print, exec, eval) under misleading names, which is a common evasion technique. The use of random, indirect, and obfuscated function calls, combined with the immediate execution of decoded payloads, is a hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation, and the code is designed to hide its true intent and evade static analysis. The presence of multi-stage decoding and execution, with no user-facing functionality, is a critical risk and is never seen in benign software.",
