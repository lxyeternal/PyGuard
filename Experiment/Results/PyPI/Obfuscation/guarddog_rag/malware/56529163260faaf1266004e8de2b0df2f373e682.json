It then encodes this data and exfiltrates it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external server (packageman.comlu.com) during the package installation process. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection, and is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute automatically when the package is installed (a classic supply chain attack vector). There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate reason for this data collection and exfiltration. These behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
