      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the installation process (likely triggered by setup.py). The PowerShell command is obfuscated and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for hiding the true intent of the command and evading detection. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and likely executes them. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload download, and persistence, all without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
