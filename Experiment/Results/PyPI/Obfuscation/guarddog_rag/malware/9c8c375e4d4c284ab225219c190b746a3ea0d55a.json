      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. Specifically: (1) It collects sensitive system and user information, including the current username, hostname, platform details, and local IP address. (2) It encodes this information using base64 and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious URL (http://numipy.openvc.org/ymal.php) without user consent or notification. (3) The exfiltration occurs automatically during package installation via the setup.py script, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (4) The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. (5) The use of os.popen to execute shell commands and capture environment variables (e.g., $LANG) is a classic reconnaissance technique. (6) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. All these patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software, according to the provided knowledge base.",
