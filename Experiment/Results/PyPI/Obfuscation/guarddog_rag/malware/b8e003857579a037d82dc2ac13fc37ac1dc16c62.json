      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (wOhwXPVStTNYhwHAjNeMkDSngTbXbNcK) that registers a function (uYOfptwxTRjPyjNKAXyvHlMoGEDOKVHs) to be executed at process exit, ensuring it runs during or after installation. (2) The registered function collects sensitive host information: it fetches the external IP address via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org'), retrieves the system hostname (os.uname()[1]), and encodes the current script's directory path. (3) This information is concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://kotko.org) with a unique query parameter. (4) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data exfiltration. (5) The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and is embedded in the setup.py install process, a classic vector for supply chain attacks. (6) The code writes a file ('pocbykotko.txt') as a marker, which is a common tactic for proof-of-compromise or attacker signaling. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
