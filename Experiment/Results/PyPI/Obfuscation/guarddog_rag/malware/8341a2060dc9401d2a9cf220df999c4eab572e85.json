It defines a custom setuptools install command (WNLzJrDqlPMYTespKmIPOmrkXIHQihMR) that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution, especially in a setup.py context, is strongly associated with malware and is never observed in benign packages. The payload could perform any action, including data exfiltration, persistence, or further compromise. The package name ('pp6bkyg6pr9aoqa4') and the use of setup_requires to pull in 'fernet' and 'requests' further support the conclusion that this is a malicious, likely typosquatted, package.",
