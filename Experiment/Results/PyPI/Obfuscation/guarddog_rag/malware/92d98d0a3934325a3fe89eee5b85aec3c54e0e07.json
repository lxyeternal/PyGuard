      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware (specifically a Roblox cookie stealer). It programmatically extracts the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from multiple browsers using browser_cookie3, validates it, and then exfiltrates it along with sensitive user information (username, Robux balance, account age, friends, IP address, etc.) to a hardcoded Discord webhook. The code also collects the victim's public IP address via an external service (https://api.ipify.org/), further fingerprinting the victim. There is no user notification or consent, and the code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names and multiple try/except blocks to suppress errors and evade detection. The use of a Discord webhook for exfiltration, combined with the targeting of browser-stored credentials and the absence of any legitimate user-facing functionality, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and never in benign software.",
