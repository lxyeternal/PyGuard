      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the installation process (in the setup.py context). The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a long base64 string is a hallmark of malware, as it hides the true intent of the command from static analysis. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a location in the user's home directory and executing it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
