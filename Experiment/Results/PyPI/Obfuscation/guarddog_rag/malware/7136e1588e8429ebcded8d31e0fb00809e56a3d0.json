It defines a custom setuptools install command (lJKzoCVVFsTniQxLAhBofeghykpmUMWE) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It uses Fernet with a hardcoded key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the decrypted code is hidden from static analysis, and arbitrary code is executed on the user's system during installation without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during install time are all strong indicators of malware, especially in the context of a setup.py script. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade detection and deliver a hidden payload.",
