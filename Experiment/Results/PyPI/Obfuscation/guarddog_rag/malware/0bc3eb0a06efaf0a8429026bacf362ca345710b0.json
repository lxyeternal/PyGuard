      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the installation/setup phase of a Python package. The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a base64 string is a classic malware tactic to hide the true intent of the payload and evade static analysis. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The setup() call is legitimate, but the preceding code is clearly malicious.",
