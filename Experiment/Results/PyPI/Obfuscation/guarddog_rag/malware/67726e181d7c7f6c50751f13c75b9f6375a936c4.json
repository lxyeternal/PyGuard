      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains several strong indicators of malicious behavior. Most critically, the function 'pgBkcOLTLCTJsJIaFqwkKjtJhdFjIAKY' reconstructs a string using obfuscated logic and then immediately executes it with eval(). This is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique, enabling arbitrary code execution. The obfuscation is designed to hide the true intent of the payload, which is a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code prints the result of 'os.system('whoami')', which collects and potentially exfiltrates the current username, another common step in system fingerprinting and reconnaissance. The presence of this code within a setup script (using setuptools) means it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The variable and function names are heavily obfuscated, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify these actions.",
