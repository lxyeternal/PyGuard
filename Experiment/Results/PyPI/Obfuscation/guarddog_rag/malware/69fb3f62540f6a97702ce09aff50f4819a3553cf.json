      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. It collects highly sensitive information from the host system, including AWS instance metadata (potentially IAM credentials), AWS CLI credentials, environment variables, SSH keys, .env files (which often contain secrets), and network configuration. It then exfiltrates this data to hardcoded, suspicious external servers (graph.pygrata.com, graphs.pygrata.com) via HTTP POST requests. The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection, and is designed to run during package installation (via setup.py), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. It also encodes user information and sends DNS queries to a suspicious domain, likely for tracking or C2 purposes. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or consent, and the code is structured to evade detection and maximize data theft. All of these behaviors are exclusively associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
