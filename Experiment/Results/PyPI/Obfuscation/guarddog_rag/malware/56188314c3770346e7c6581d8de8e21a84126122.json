      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (AWS IAM credentials, AWS config, environment variables, SSH keys, .env files, IP addresses, username, hostname, current working directory), writes this data to a randomly named file, and exfiltrates it to external, hardcoded URLs (http://graphs.pygrata.com/uploader.php and http://graphs.pygrata.com/api.php) via HTTP POST requests. It also performs DNS queries to a suspicious domain (isuser.api.pygrata.com) using a value derived from the username, likely for tracking or C2 purposes. The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses all exceptions to evade detection, and is embedded in a setup.py context, indicating it is designed to execute during package installation (a classic supply chain attack vector). There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation, and all actions are performed without user consent. The use of subprocess.getoutput to execute shell commands for credential and secret theft, combined with automated exfiltration, matches patterns found exclusively in malware and never in benign software.",
