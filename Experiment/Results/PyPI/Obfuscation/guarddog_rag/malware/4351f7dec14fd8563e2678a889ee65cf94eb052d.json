      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious commands on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, making it difficult to immediately determine its intent, but this pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks where code is executed during package installation (as seen here, embedded in a setup.py script). The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the behavior from users and security tools. The code does not provide any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that would justify such behavior. All these factors, combined with the use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and the context of a setup script, indicate with high confidence that this code is malicious.",
