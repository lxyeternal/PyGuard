The command is run only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a classic method for hiding malicious payloads. The base64 string decodes to a command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is designed to execute automatically when the package is installed, without user consent or notification, and downloads and runs an untrusted executable, potentially compromising the system. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution.",
