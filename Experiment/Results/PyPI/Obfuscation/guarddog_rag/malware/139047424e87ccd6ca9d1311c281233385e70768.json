      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (InstallCommand) that, during package installation, reconstructs and executes an obfuscated payload. The payload is stored as an encrypted/encoded string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) and a key (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). The code XOR-decrypts the payload and immediately executes it using eval(compile(..., 'exec')), all within a try/except block that suppresses errors. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the installer's system without their knowledge or consent. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior.",
