      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It creates a TCP socket and connects to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (dzgi0h7on1jhzdg0vknw9pp9309rxjl8.oastify.com) on port 10010, which is not a standard or trusted endpoint. It then redirects the standard input, output, and error file descriptors to this socket, a classic technique for establishing a reverse shell, allowing remote control of the infected system. Furthermore, it decodes a base32-encoded string (obfuscated as 'F5R!S3RPMJQX!2A='.replace('!','G')) and executes the resulting binary with subprocess.call, passing '-i' as an argument. This is a textbook example of code obfuscation and dynamic payload execution, both of which are hallmarks of malware. The code lacks any user interaction, documentation, or legitimate business logic, and all actions are performed without user consent. The combination of outbound C2 communication, I/O redirection, obfuscated payload decoding, and immediate execution is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never present in benign software.",
