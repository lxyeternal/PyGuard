It defines a custom setuptools install command (hevLVWdhQoUkmMrJptzdlNJpzPNRrSgI) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the decrypted code can perform arbitrary actions on the victim's machine at install time, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, dynamic code execution, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload.",
