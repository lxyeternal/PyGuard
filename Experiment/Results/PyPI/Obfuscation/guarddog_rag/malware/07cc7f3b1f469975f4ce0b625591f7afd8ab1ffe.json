      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (InstallCommand) that, during package installation, reconstructs an obfuscated payload by XOR-ing two hardcoded strings. The resulting string is then dynamically executed using eval(compile(...)), which enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system at install time. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is used exclusively in malware samples. The obfuscation, lack of user notification, and execution of hidden code during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior.",
