      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (NKSJaMrhcgngiHnqfcZvlhjpfMykxugP) that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution, especially in the context of a setup script, is strongly associated with malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload.",
