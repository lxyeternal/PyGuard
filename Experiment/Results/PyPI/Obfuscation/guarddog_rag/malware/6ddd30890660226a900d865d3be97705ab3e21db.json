      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it to a hidden location and running it. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks via Python packages, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
