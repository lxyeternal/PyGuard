      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, making its intent difficult to determine at a glance, but such usage is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. The presence of this logic in a setup script (which runs during package installation) is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The rest of the setup() call is benign, but the presence of the obfuscated PowerShell execution is a critical risk indicator.",
