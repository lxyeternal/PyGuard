      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. First, it contains an obfuscated function (ZTUcYyfsvCcCMQZKoDsvcwZXBVXpXgqA) that reconstructs and executes code dynamically using eval on a string that is decoded and transformed at runtime, a classic malware obfuscation and code injection technique. Second, it executes a shell command via subprocess.getoutput that downloads a remote shell script (seo.sh) from a suspicious, non-corporate GitHub URL, saves it as 'gay.sh' in /tmp, makes it executable, and runs it. This is a textbook example of remote code execution and payload delivery, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malware propagation. Third, the code is embedded in a setup.py context (using setuptools), meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages and supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying these actions. The combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, remote payload download and execution, and execution during installation makes this code critically malicious.",
