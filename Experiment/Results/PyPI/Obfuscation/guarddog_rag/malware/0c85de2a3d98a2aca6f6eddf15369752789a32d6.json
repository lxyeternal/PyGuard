The function responsible for this (imnWtpMvCGwFHpFlIXBKvNNYUNhztEsB) is executed unconditionally when the script runs, and is placed in the global scope of what appears to be a setup script for a Python package. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is embedded in the installation or setup process of a package to steal information from unsuspecting users. The use of obfuscated function and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a package setup script to collect and transmit such information to an external, non-corporate server.",
