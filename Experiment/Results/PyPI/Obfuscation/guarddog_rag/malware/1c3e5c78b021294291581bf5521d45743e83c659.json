      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly obfuscated payload that is base64-decoded and executed at install time via exec and compile, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file creation, system command execution, and network communication. It writes a Python script to a temporary file that downloads and executes code from a suspicious hardcoded IP address (http://20.224.2.213//inject/ctE6toLDoHBiJApj) using urllib. This is a classic pattern for remote code execution and payload delivery. The code also attempts to clean up after itself and suppresses exceptions, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. The use of exec on decoded, dynamically generated code, especially in a setup script, is never seen in benign software and is a critical indicator of malicious intent.",
