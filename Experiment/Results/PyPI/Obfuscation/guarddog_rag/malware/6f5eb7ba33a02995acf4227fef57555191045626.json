      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is triggered during package installation (setup.py context), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the check for a non-descriptive file ('tahg'), and the lack of user notification or legitimate business logic further confirm malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware and is never seen in benign software.",
