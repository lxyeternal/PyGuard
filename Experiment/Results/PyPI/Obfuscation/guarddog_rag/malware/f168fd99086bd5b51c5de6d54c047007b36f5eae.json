      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for delivering and executing obfuscated malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command, once decoded, appears to download and execute a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and writes it to a file named 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
