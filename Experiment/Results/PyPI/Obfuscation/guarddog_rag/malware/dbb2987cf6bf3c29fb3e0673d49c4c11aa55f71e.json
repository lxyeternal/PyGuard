      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of a Discord token stealer and information exfiltration malware. It exhibits multiple critical risk indicators: (1) It searches for Discord and browser tokens in sensitive directories (AppData, Local, Roaming, browser storage), (2) extracts and validates Discord tokens using regex and API calls, (3) collects additional user information (email, phone, billing/payment methods), (4) encodes and exfiltrates this data to an attacker-controlled endpoint via a Discord webhook (the webhook URL is base64-encoded for obfuscation), and (5) collects the victim's external IP address. The code is heavily obfuscated, uses try/except to suppress errors, and has no user notification or legitimate business logic. The use of suspicious imports (receiver, sender), hardcoded and obfuscated URLs, and the targeting of browser/Discord storage locations are all hallmarks of credential-stealing malware. There is no legitimate reason for a benign application to perform these actions.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a class with a method that, when called, retrieves the public IP address of the host by making an HTTP GET request to https://api.ipify.org/. This is a classic system fingerprinting technique used in malware to collect host-specific information (the external IP address) without user consent. The use of a hardcoded external URL, lack of user notification, and absence of legitimate business logic or documentation further elevate the risk. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it is used for reconnaissance, tracking, or as a precursor to further malicious activity. The obfuscated class and method names also suggest an attempt to hide the code's intent.",
