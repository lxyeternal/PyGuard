The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which is a classic method for hiding malicious activity from the user. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a location in the user's home directory and executing it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, downloads and runs a remote payload, and uses obfuscation and exception suppression to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
