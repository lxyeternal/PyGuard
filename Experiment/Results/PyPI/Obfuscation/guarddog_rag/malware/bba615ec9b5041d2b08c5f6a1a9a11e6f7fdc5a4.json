      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. First, it collects sensitive system information (hostname and current working directory) and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious URL (https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/) without user consent or notification. This is a classic data exfiltration pattern seen exclusively in malware. Second, it establishes a TCP connection to a hardcoded external host (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io:19931) and redirects the process's standard input, output, and error streams to this socket, then spawns a shell (pty.spawn('sh')). This is a textbook reverse shell, enabling remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive class and variable names, and all these actions are performed without any legitimate user-facing functionality, error handling, or documentation. The combination of data exfiltration and remote shell access is a hallmark of backdoors and remote access trojans (RATs). There are no benign use cases for this pattern, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators from the knowledge base.",
