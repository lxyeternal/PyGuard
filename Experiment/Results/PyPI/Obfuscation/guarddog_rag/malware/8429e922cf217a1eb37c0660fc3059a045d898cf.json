It then immediately executes this file using os.system('start ' + filename). This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary without user interaction, validation, or notification—is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks, especially when embedded in a setup.py or similar installation script. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of error handling, and the absence of any legitimate business logic further reinforce the malicious nature. This code would execute automatically if the package is installed, making it a high-severity supply chain threat.",
