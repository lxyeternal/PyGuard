      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious commands on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, making it difficult to immediately determine its intent, but this pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks where code is executed during package installation (as seen here, embedded in a setup script). The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides malicious activity. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command, especially one that may download or execute remote payloads. This matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated code execution, use of '-EncodedCommand', hidden process creation, and execution during installation.",
