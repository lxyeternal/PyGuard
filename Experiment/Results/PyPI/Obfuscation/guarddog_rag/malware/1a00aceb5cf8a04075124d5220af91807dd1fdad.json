It defines a custom setuptools install command (XhKIhSZbLiKUwNIaZJrFdDMfdqHSLKml) that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python: arbitrary, obfuscated code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic code execution, and obfuscated class/variable names further indicate an attempt to evade detection and analysis. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to run only on Windows systems, increasing the likelihood of targeted malicious activity.",
