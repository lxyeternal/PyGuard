      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (via setup.py). Specifically, if the 'tahg' path does not exist, it runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then executes them. This enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and potential persistence or further compromise. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the embedding of this logic in a setup script (which runs automatically during installation) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package supply chain attacks.",
