      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing potentially harmful commands on a victim's system. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and running it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the malicious code is embedded in a setup script, so it will execute during package installation, potentially compromising any system that installs the package. All these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, remote payload download, execution during install, and error suppression—are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
