      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, and username) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com). This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, especially concerning because it is triggered during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive class and variable names, and there is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data collection and transmission. The use of a custom install command in setup.py to execute this logic further elevates the risk, as it ensures the code runs automatically on installation, which is a common vector for malicious PyPI packages.",
