      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, downloads a remote Python script ('qrcodes.py') from a suspicious, non-official URL (https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py) using the requests library. It then writes this file to disk and immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware: it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a package install script to download and execute remote code in this manner, and this behavior is never observed in benign software.",
