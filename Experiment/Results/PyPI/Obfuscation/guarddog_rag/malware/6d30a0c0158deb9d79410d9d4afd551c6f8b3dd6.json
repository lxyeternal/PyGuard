This is a classic pattern of information-stealing malware, especially in the context of a setup or installation script, as it is executed automatically when the package is installed. The use of a non-corporate, non-standard domain, lack of user interaction, and the immediate exfiltration of host-specific data are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is not observed in benign software and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem.",
