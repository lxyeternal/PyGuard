      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that, when triggered during package installation or development, execute the function IRQUQVygtkULQrnwLXGKlmvpwvPAdvWb. This function collects all environment variables from the victim's system (os.environ), encodes them, and attempts to send them via an HTTP request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: exfiltrating sensitive system information during package installation without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, the lack of user notification, and the embedding of this logic in install/develop hooks are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code matches multiple critical risk patterns associated exclusively with malware, including data exfiltration, supply chain attack vectors, and obfuscation.",
