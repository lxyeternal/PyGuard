      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary file ('node') from a suspicious, non-official URL ('https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node') and writes it to '/tmp/node'. It then makes the file executable and immediately executes it using 'system('cd /tmp && chmod +x node && ./node')'. This pattern is a hallmark of malware: it enables remote code execution by fetching and running an untrusted payload during package installation or import. The function is invoked at the top level, ensuring execution as soon as the package is installed or run. The use of obfuscated function names, lack of user interaction, and absence of legitimate business logic further indicate malicious intent. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, commonly seen in malicious PyPI packages.",
