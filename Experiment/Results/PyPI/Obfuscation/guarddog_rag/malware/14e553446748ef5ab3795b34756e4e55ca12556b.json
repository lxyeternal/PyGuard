      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (UbJerCzwjGXVgsPmMjytWmiUaLsbcZEH) that executes automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (2) It collects sensitive host information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (j0j0.xyz) via multiple HTTP GET requests, including dynamically constructed subdomains based on the victim's system information. (3) It reads potentially sensitive system files (/etc/debconf.conf, /.dockerenv, /root/.wget-hsts) and exfiltrates their contents to the same external server via HTTP POST requests. (4) The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable and class names, and there is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation. (5) The use of a custom install command in setup() ensures this code runs automatically and covertly during installation, without user consent or notification. All of these behaviors are exclusive to malware samples and are never observed in benign software, according to the provided knowledge base.",
