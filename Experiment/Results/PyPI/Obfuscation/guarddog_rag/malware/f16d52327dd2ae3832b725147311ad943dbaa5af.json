      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command via os.system to perform an outbound HTTP request using curl to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (canarytokens.com). This occurs outside of any user-facing logic and is placed after the setuptools.setup() call, which is typically executed during package installation. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, where arbitrary code is executed on the user's system during installation. The use of a hardcoded external URL, lack of user notification or consent, and the absence of any legitimate business logic for this network operation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The URL is likely used for host fingerprinting, tracking, or as a canary to detect installations, which is a common tactic in malware. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is consistently associated with malware in the Python ecosystem.",
