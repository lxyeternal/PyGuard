      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (rXLKMXvsXuqbEpJNTsudcDHTwIPKcQAX) that, during package installation on Windows systems, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only executed during installation, and can perform arbitrary actions on the victim's machine. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic code execution, and obfuscated variable/class names are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload.",
