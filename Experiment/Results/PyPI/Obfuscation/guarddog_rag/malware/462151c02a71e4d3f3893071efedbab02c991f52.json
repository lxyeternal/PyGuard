      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, making its intent difficult to determine at a glance, but such usage is overwhelmingly associated with malware, especially in the context of setup scripts. The code is wrapped in a try/except block that suppresses all errors, further hiding its activity. The use of a non-standard argument 'lduDPGfopsuNcxoZEMYOKbtglXiunzwZ' (which is not a valid subprocess.Popen parameter) is likely an obfuscation or anti-analysis technique. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
