It defines a custom setuptools install command (mezLYlFERIvLubZWTlLxzepCnlyvpKHQ) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes the decrypted code using exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only revealed and executed at install time, which can result in arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload.",
