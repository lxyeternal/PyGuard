The command is obfuscated and is run only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' is a hallmark of malware, as it allows arbitrary and stealthy execution of potentially harmful commands or scripts without user consent or visibility. The base64-encoded PowerShell command appears to download and/or execute a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern. The code is wrapped in try/except blocks to suppress errors and avoid detection. This behavior is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign Python packages.",
