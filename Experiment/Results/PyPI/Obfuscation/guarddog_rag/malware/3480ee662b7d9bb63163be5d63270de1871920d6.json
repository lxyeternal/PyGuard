This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as the actual command is hidden from static analysis and user inspection. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides any failures or detection. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malware delivery, especially when embedded in a setup script that will be executed during package installation. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands that download and run remote code.",
