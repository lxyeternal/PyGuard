      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware, specifically a 'cookie grabber' targeting Roblox Studio users. It accesses the Windows registry to extract the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie, which is a sensitive authentication token for Roblox accounts. The code then exfiltrates this token by sending it to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via an HTTP POST request. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this operation. The use of a Discord webhook for exfiltration, the targeting of sensitive registry keys, and the suppression of all exceptions to avoid detection are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never seen in benign software.",
