(2) It parses this list for entries matching the current operating system, then downloads additional files (presumably executables) from the same remote server. (3) It writes these files to disk and immediately executes them using os.system, with platform-specific logic for Linux, macOS, and Windows. (4) There is no user interaction, consent, or notification, and no validation or integrity checking of the downloaded files. (5) The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable and function names, a common technique to evade detection and hinder analysis. (6) The pattern of downloading and executing remote payloads is a classic malware delivery mechanism, and is never observed in benign software. (7) The code is structured to run this behavior as a side effect of calling any of the HTTP method wrapper functions, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious package design. (8) There is no legitimate business logic or documentation justifying this behavior.",
