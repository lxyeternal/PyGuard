      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command, once decoded, appears to download and execute a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a location in the user's home directory and executing it. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the malicious activity. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks, as it is embedded in a setup script and will execute during package installation, potentially compromising the system without user consent. All of these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, remote payload download, hidden execution, and error suppression—are hallmarks of malware and are not found in benign software.",
