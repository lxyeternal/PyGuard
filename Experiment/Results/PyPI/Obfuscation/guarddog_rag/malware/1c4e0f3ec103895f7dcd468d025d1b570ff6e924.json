      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with supply chain attacks and malware. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (QrAzAPuPrKxveXkUFgqzXoRissMMGmFl) that executes arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (2) During installation, it creates directories in the Windows Startup folder and another suspiciously named folder ('Powerpoint') within the Start Menu, which is a classic persistence mechanism. (3) It clones two remote GitHub repositories (one named 'test2lmaos', the other 'defonotagrabber') into these sensitive locations. The repository name 'defonotagrabber' is especially suspicious and strongly suggests credential or data theft. (4) It moves a Python file ('test.py') from the cloned repository into the Startup folder, which could ensure execution on system startup. (5) It attempts to execute a Windows executable ('main.exe') from the 'defonotagrabber' repository, which could be any arbitrary payload, including malware. (6) All of these actions are performed without user consent, logging, or legitimate business logic, and are triggered automatically during package installation, making this a severe supply chain risk. (7) The code uses obfuscated variable and class names, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. (8) The use of hardcoded, non-corporate GitHub URLs for payload delivery is a strong indicator of malicious intent. (9) The code targets sensitive user-specific locations (AppData, Startup), which is never justified in benign packages. (10) There is no legitimate reason for a Python package to perform these actions during installation.",
