It then exfiltrates this sensitive credential to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable and function names, suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection, and runs the data theft in multiple threads for stealth and reliability. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic. The use of a Discord webhook for exfiltration, combined with credential theft and obfuscation, is a hallmark of information-stealing malware.",
