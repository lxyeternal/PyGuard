The command is obfuscated using PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent and evade detection. The base64 payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it to a hidden location and running it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered automatically upon installation, without user consent or notification, and is designed to download and execute potentially malicious payloads. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
