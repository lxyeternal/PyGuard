      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable (host fingerprinting) and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a classic data exfiltration technique. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com), writes it to disk with a generic filename (ini_file_pyp_41.exe), and immediately executes it via os.system('start ...'), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. (3) All of this logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, ensuring it runs automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (4) The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses all exceptions (try/except: pass), and provides no user notification or consent. (5) There is no legitimate business logic, documentation, or user-facing functionality. These behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software, according to the provided knowledge base.",
