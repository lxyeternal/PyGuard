This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is a critical risk indicator. The use of subprocess.Popen to run a PowerShell command with the -EncodedCommand flag is a classic technique for delivering and executing obfuscated malicious payloads. The command is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute a hidden, encoded PowerShell command, especially without user interaction or notification. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and is never seen in benign software.",
