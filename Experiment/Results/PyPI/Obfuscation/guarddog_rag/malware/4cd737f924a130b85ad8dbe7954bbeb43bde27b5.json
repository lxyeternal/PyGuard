      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (tvrXEPbizsyyJMjxMFUwmMnFjeGQuJaJ) that overrides the installation process. During installation, if the OS is Windows, it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses Fernet with a hardcoded key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is immediately executed via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the decrypted code can perform arbitrary actions on the victim's machine at install time, including data exfiltration, remote code execution, or persistence. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and detection.",
