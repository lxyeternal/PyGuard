      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user interaction or notification. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the behavior. The encoded PowerShell command appears to download and execute a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then invoking it, which is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware, especially when embedded in a setup script that runs during package installation.",
