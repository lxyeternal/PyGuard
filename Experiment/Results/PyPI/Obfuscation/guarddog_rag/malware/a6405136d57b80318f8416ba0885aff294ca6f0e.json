      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (likely via setup.py). This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is a critical risk pattern. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. The command is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a typical evasion or persistence check. The use of subprocess.Popen with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' is strongly associated with malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent or visibility. The try/except blocks suppress all errors, further hiding malicious activity. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of malicious activity, especially in the context of a Python package installation script.",
