      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. It is designed to execute during the installation of a Python package (via custom setuptools install/develop hooks), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The code systematically searches for sensitive files (such as .env files and SSH private keys), reads their contents, base64-encodes them, and exfiltrates the data to a hardcoded, suspicious external server (http://bellazik.000webhostapp.com:443) using curl via subprocess. It also collects and exfiltrates all environment variables. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding, and silent exception handling further indicate attempts to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify these actions. The combination of credential theft, environment reconnaissance, and automated exfiltration during package installation is a strong, exclusive indicator of malware.",
