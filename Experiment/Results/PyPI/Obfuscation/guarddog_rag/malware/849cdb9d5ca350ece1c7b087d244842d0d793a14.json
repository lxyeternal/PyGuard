This is done without user consent, notification, or any legitimate business logic. The exfiltration occurs immediately upon execution, and the code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will run automatically during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The use of a suspicious, non-corporate IP address, lack of documentation, and the absence of any user-facing functionality further confirm malicious intent. The code also suppresses all exceptions during the exfiltration attempt, which is a common evasion technique in malware.",
