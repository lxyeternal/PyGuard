      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known malware and supply chain attack patterns. Specifically: (1) It downloads files from hardcoded, suspicious IP addresses (http://52.14.229.35:1122/connect-CANDC.txt and http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg), which are not associated with any legitimate software distribution. (2) The downloaded files are written to disk and then immediately executed as batch files via shell commands (cmd /c ...), a classic technique for remote code execution and payload delivery. (3) The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (4) There is no user notification, consent, or validation of the downloaded content before execution. (5) The code attempts to install the 'requests' library if missing, ensuring its own dependencies for network communication are met, which is a common tactic in malware to guarantee execution. (6) The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions, further indicating an attempt to evade detection and analysis. (7) The use of subprocess.Popen to execute shell commands, including moving, running, and deleting batch files, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, especially in the absence of any legitimate business logic. (8) The code checks for administrative privileges and attempts to escalate or notify the user if not present, which is a common step in malware to ensure successful payload execution. (9) The overall structure, including the use of try/except blocks to suppress errors and the lack of any legitimate user-facing functionality, is consistent with known Python malware samples. (10) The code is not part of any reputable open-source project and uses a suspicious package name ('gofqlxfjwh00vadb'), further increasing suspicion.",
