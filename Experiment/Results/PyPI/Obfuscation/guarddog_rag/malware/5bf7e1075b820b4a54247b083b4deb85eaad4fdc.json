      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as the actual command is hidden from static analysis and user inspection. The PowerShell command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The encoded PowerShell payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's profile, and then executes it. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user consent or notification. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
