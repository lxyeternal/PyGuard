      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that, when triggered during package installation (e.g., via pip install), will execute the function veCWXCnfjifUTyWAzNEgUShJiOVJRXEr. This function downloads a remote file (install.bat) from a hardcoded, suspicious Discord CDN URL using the requests library, writes it to disk, and then immediately executes it via os.system with elevated privileges (RunAsInvoker). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is exclusively observed in malware samples. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, lacks user notification or consent, and provides no legitimate business logic for this behavior. The use of a remote, non-corporate URL, combined with automatic execution of a downloaded script during installation, is a critical risk and enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.",
