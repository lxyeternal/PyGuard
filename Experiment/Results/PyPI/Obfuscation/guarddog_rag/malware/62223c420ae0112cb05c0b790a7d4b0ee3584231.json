      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom setuptools install command (EaHasRBUgoHzsIsbqtsLVRrlymCzrPkm) that executes automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. Within this install hook, it collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, username) and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (j0j0.xyz) via multiple HTTP GET requests. Furthermore, it reads the contents of highly sensitive system files (/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow) and exfiltrates them via HTTP POST requests to the same external server. The code uses obfuscated variable names, lacks any user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic, and is designed to run covertly during installation. The combination of data exfiltration, targeting of sensitive files, and execution during install time is exclusively observed in malware and never in benign software. This is a textbook example of a malicious supply chain attack targeting Python environments.",
