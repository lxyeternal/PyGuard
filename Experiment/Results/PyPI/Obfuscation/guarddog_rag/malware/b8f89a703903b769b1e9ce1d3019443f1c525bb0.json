      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It is a classic example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package. The code defines a custom setuptools install command that executes automatically during package installation. During this process, it collects extensive system information, including the OS version, current working directory, network configuration (ifconfig/ipconfig), running processes (tasklist), public IP address (via curl ifconfig.me), username (whoami), and hostname. It then exfiltrates all this information to an external server using a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, lacks any user notification or consent, and is triggered during installation, which is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages. The use of os.popen and os.system to execute shell commands and send data externally, especially in a setup script, is a critical risk and is never justified in benign software. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
