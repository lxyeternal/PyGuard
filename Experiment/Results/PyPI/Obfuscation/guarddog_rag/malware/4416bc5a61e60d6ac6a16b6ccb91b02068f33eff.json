Specifically, it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote executable from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (esqueleslt.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is designed to execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification, and downloads and runs a potentially malicious binary. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote payload delivery are all strong indicators of malware.",
