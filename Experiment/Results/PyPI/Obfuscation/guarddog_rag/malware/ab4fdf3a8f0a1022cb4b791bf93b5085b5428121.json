      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with malware and supply chain attacks. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command that executes arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (2) It creates directories in the Windows Startup folder and another suspiciously named folder ('Powerpoint') within the Start Menu, which is a classic persistence mechanism. (3) It clones two remote GitHub repositories ('test2lmaos' and 'defonotagrabber') into these sensitive locations. The repository name 'defonotagrabber' is especially suspicious, suggesting credential or data theft. (4) It renames and moves a Python script into the Startup folder, ensuring it will be executed on user login. (5) It attempts to execute a Windows executable ('main.exe') from the cloned repository, which could be any arbitrary payload. (6) All of these actions are performed without user consent, notification, or legitimate business logic, and are heavily obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names. (7) The code is triggered automatically during package installation, making it a severe supply chain risk. (8) The use of hardcoded, non-corporate GitHub URLs, and the lack of any user-facing functionality, further confirm the malicious intent.",
