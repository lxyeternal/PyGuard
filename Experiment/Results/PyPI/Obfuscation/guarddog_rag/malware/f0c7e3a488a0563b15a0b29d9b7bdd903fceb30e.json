      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, especially in the context of a supply chain attack via a Python package. Specifically: (1) It writes a Python script to a temporary file that, when executed, downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw) using exec(). This enables arbitrary remote code execution on the victim's machine. (2) The code then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system call, with obfuscated variable names and minimal error handling (try/except pass), which is a common evasion technique. (3) The suspicious behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. (4) The use of indirect imports, obfuscated variable names, and lack of user notification or consent further indicate malicious intent. (5) The remote URL is not a trusted or official source, and there is no validation or integrity checking of the downloaded code. All these factors, especially the combination of remote code download and execution during installation, are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign packages.",
