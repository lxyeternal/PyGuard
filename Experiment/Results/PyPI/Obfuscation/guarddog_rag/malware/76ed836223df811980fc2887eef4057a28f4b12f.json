      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated using the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the command and evade detection. The base64 string decodes to a command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then executes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, often used in supply chain attacks via malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user interaction or notification, and the execution of code during installation (setup.py) further confirm the malicious nature of this code.",
