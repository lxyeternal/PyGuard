This is done without user consent, notification, or any legitimate business logic. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the lack of error handling or documentation, and the embedding of this behavior in the installation process are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of information-stealing and reconnaissance malware, especially in the context of malicious Python packages distributed via PyPI or similar channels.",
