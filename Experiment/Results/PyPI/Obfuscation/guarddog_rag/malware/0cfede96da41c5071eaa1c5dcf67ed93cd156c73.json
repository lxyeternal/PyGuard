      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines custom setuptools install, develop, and egg_info commands that, when triggered during package installation or development, execute a shell command via subprocess.call. The command runs a hardcoded binary/script located at '/home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/motivate1234/run_echo' with sudo privileges. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks: it enables arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of a non-standard, hidden path and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality further indicate malicious intent. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and is never present in benign software.",
