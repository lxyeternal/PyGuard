      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py context). This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is a critical risk pattern. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed without user consent or notification, and the process window is hidden. The code checks for the existence of a file or directory ('tahg') and, if not present, launches the PowerShell command. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution, potential payload download, persistence, or data exfiltration. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The presence of this pattern in a setup script means it will be triggered during package installation, making it a high-severity supply chain threat.",
