      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (current working directory via 'pwd', current user via 'whoami', and hostname via 'hostname') by executing shell commands. It then encodes this information as URL parameters and sends it to an external, hardcoded, non-corporate URL ('http://pt.traktrain.com/RCE_PYTHON'). This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, commonly seen in supply chain attacks, especially when embedded in a setup script (as is the case here, within a setuptools setup.py). There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data collection and exfiltration. The use of os.popen to execute shell commands and immediate network transmission of the results is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern is not observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware targeting the supply chain.",
