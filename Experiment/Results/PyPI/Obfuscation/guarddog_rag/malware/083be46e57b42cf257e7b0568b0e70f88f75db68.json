      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks and Python malware. Specifically: (1) It collects the system's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a hallmark of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com), writes it to disk, and executes it using os.system, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. (3) All of this is triggered automatically during the package installation process by overriding the setuptools install command, ensuring the malicious actions occur without user consent or awareness. (4) The code uses obfuscated variable names, suppresses all exceptions (hiding errors or detection), and provides no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software, especially in the context of Python package installation scripts.",
