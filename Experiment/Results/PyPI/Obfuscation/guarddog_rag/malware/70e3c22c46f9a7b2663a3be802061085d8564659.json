      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, making its intent deliberately hidden from static analysis. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks where code is executed during package installation (as seen here, embedded in a setup.py script). The encoded command likely downloads and executes a remote payload, as suggested by the presence of a suspicious URL in the decoded string. All these behaviors match critical risk indicators for Python malware.",
