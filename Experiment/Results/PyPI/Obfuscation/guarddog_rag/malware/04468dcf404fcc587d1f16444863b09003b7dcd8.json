The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a long base64 string is a classic malware pattern for delivering and executing remote payloads or performing malicious actions without user consent. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the user's system during package installation, with no legitimate business logic or user-facing purpose. The presence of a suspicious, obfuscated PowerShell command, lack of user notification, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
