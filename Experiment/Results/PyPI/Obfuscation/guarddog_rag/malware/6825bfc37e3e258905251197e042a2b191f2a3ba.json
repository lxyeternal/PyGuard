      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function rn() that, when executed, immediately calls os.system('poweroff') on Linux or macOS, or os.system('shutdown /s -f -t 0') on Windows. This will forcibly power off or shut down the user's computer without any user interaction, notification, or consent. The function rn() is called unconditionally before the setup() function, meaning this code will execute as soon as the script is run (including during package installation if this is a setup.py file). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is embedded in a package's installation script to disrupt or damage user systems. There is no legitimate business logic, user-facing functionality, or documentation justifying this behavior. The use of os.system to execute system shutdown commands in a setup script is strongly associated with malware and is never observed in benign software.",
