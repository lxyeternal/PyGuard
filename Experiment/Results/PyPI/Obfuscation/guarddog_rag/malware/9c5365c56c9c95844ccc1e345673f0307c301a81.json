      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, specifically those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. During the installation process (via a custom setuptools install command), it collects sensitive host information: the external IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the system hostname (via os.uname()), and the installation path. It then encodes this data using base64 and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://kotko.org) without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of error handling, and the embedding of this logic in the install hook (ensuring it runs automatically on package installation) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks targeting the Python ecosystem.",
