      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. It collects extensive sensitive system and user information, including hostname, local and public IP addresses, MAC address, geolocation, Windows product key, browser credentials, and tokens from Discord and browsers. It uses obfuscated variable names and imports, accesses browser storage and decrypts stored credentials, and writes them to files in system directories. The code then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...), which is a common command-and-control (C2) exfiltration technique. It also attempts to evade detection by suppressing exceptions, uses try/except blocks extensively, and cleans up evidence by deleting files after exfiltration. The code includes modules and logic for credential theft (browser_cookie3, cryptography, sqlite3), system reconnaissance (psutil, platform, socket), and data exfiltration (requests, dhooks). There is no legitimate user-facing functionality, documentation, or consent for these actions. The combination of these behaviors, especially the automated exfiltration of credentials and system information to an external server, is a hallmark of information-stealing malware.",
