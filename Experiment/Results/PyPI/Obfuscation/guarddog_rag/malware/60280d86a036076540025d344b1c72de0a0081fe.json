      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, downloads a Windows executable ('funnymoment.exe') from a hardcoded, suspicious Discord CDN URL and executes it immediately using subprocess.call. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious payload is delivered and executed during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, the lack of any legitimate business logic, and the execution of a remote binary are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package supply chain attacks.",
