      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information, including environment variables, the system's uname, the current stack trace, and the external IP address (via https://ipinfo.io/ip). It then encodes this information as JSON and exfiltrates it to a remote server whose URL is obfuscated using base64 encoding. The destination is not a well-known or trusted domain, and the use of base64 encoding is a classic obfuscation technique to evade detection. The code is designed to run automatically (likely during installation or initialization), with checks to avoid execution on certain hostnames or filenames (possibly to evade detection in analysis environments). There is no user notification or consent before exfiltrating this data. The combination of environment reconnaissance, obfuscation, and automated exfiltration to an external server is a hallmark of information-stealing malware and supply chain attacks.",
