      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (in the setup.py context) if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a well-known obfuscation and evasion technique in malware. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it to a hidden location and running it. This enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
