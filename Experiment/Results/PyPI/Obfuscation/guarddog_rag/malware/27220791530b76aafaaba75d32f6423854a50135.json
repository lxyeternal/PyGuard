It downloads a Windows executable (supra.exe) from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (MediaFire) and writes it directly to the user's Startup folder under the name 'minecraft_servers.exe', establishing persistence so the payload will execute on every system boot. Immediately after downloading, it executes the file using subprocess.call, suppressing all output. These actions are performed without user consent, notification, or any legitimate business logic. The use of environment variables to target the user's profile, the lack of error handling, and the embedding of this logic in what appears to be a setup script (suggesting a supply chain attack vector) further confirm malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never seen in benign software.",
