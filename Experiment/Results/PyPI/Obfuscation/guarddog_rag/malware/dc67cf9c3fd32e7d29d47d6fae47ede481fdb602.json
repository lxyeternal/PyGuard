      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, which is a strong indicator of intent to hide the actual operation from static analysis and users. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior. The combination of these factors—obfuscated command execution, hidden window, encoded payload, error suppression, and execution during installation—matches multiple high-confidence malicious patterns, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and evasion.",
