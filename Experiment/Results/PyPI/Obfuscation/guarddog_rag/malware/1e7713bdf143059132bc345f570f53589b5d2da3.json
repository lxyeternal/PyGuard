      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (likely via setup.py). The command is run only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated using the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The base64 string decodes to a command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern: it delivers and executes a remote payload on the victim's machine without user consent, using obfuscation and exception suppression to evade detection. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides malicious activity. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
