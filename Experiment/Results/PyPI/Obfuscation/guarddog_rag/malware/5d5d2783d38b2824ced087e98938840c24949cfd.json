      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its behavior. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, appears to download and execute a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and executing it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is embedded in a setup script, so it will run automatically during package installation, potentially compromising any system that installs the package. All of these behaviors—obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, error suppression, and execution during installation—are strong, exclusive indicators of malware.",
