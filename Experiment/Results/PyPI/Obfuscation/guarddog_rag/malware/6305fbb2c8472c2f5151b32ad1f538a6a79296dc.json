      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (likely via setup.py). The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is obfuscated using the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for hiding malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then running it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, often used in supply chain attacks via malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, and the execution of code during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code matches multiple critical risk patterns: obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, and supply chain attack vector.",
