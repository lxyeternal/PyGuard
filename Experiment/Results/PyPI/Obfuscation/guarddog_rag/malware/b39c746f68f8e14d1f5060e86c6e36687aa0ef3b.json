      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (or import) if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and potential persistence or further compromise. The use of try/except to suppress all errors, the lack of user notification, and the embedding of this logic in a setup script are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks.",
