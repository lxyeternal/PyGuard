      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior. It downloads a list of filenames from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), then for each filename, it attempts to download an executable from the same IP and writes it to disk. It then sets executable permissions and runs the downloaded file using os.system, with different commands for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, lacks any user interaction, error handling, or legitimate business logic, and is designed to execute arbitrary code fetched from a remote server. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential system compromise. The use of direct IP addresses, lack of documentation, and immediate execution of downloaded content further confirm its malicious intent.",
