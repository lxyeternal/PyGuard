It defines a custom setuptools install command (HIkhjXAktLKTUWnFeaStaPyeSWpLypJN) that, during package installation, collects all environment variables from the victim's system (os.environ.items()), and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain (https://a5gpivpedls2wjfxl0bm6dmwenke84wt.oastify.com) without user consent or notification. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed automatically during package installation, exfiltrating sensitive information (such as credentials, tokens, and configuration secrets) to an attacker-controlled server. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the lack of legitimate business logic, and the embedding of this behavior in the install hook further confirm the malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of information-stealing malware.",
