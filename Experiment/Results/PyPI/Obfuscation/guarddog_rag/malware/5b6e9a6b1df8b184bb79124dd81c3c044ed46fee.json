It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) without user consent or notification. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it leverages the installation process to execute code and transmit environment data to an attacker-controlled server. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, lack of documentation, and the absence of any legitimate business logic further confirm malicious intent. This behavior is never observed in benign software and is a critical risk indicator.",
