It uses __import__('builtins').exec(__import__('builtins').compile(...)), which is a classic technique for dynamic code execution. The payload is base64-encoded and, when decoded, reveals code that: (1) imports modules for file and process manipulation, (2) downloads and executes code from a remote URL (http://wasp.plague.fun/inject/ISUP8AVHicLUbvIS), (3) writes the downloaded content to a temporary file, (4) attempts to execute the file, and (5) suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The use of obfuscation, dynamic execution, and remote payload retrieval is exclusively observed in malware and never in benign software. The code matches multiple critical risk indicators, including dynamic code execution, obfuscation, remote code download, and execution during installation.",
