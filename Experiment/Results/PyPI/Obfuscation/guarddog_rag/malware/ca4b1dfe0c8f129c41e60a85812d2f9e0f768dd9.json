      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (github.com/T4hg/eeel/raw/master/Stage1.exe) and writes it to a hidden location (WindowsCache.exe) in the user's home directory. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is embedded in a setup script, so it will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All of these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, remote payload download, hidden execution, and execution during installation—are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
