      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, making its intent opaque and likely designed to evade static analysis. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures and prevents detection. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command, especially one that is encoded and potentially downloads or executes further payloads. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem.",
