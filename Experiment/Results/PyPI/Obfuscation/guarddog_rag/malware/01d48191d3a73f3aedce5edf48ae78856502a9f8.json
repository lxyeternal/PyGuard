      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that executes during package installation. In the overridden install method, it collects the system's hostname and IP address using socket.gethostname() and socket.gethostbyname(). It then sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL using the discord.py library and aiohttp. This exfiltration of host-specific information to an external, attacker-controlled server (Discord webhook) without user consent is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable and class names, and the malicious logic is embedded in the installation process, ensuring it runs automatically when the package is installed. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or documentation justifying this behavior. The use of a Discord webhook for data exfiltration, combined with execution during install, is a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
