      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command, once decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), and writes it to a location in the user's home directory (WindowsCache.exe), then executes it. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the malicious activity. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malware delivery, especially when embedded in a setup script that will run during package installation. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
