      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered during package installation, collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io). The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive class and variable names, and there is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data collection and exfiltration. Embedding this behavior in a setup/install hook is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. The use of the requests module to send environment data to an external, non-corporate server during installation is a critical risk indicator and is strongly associated with malware.",
