      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, executes a base64-encoded shell command. The decoded command opens a reverse shell to a hardcoded IP address (13.93.28.37) and port (8888), giving an attacker remote access to the victim's system. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload, execution during package installation (a classic supply chain attack vector), and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user notification are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is exclusively observed in malicious samples and is never seen in benign software. The code is designed to compromise the system of anyone who installs the package, making it critically dangerous.",
