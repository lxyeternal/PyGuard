      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive host information (hostname, working directory, local IP addresses), encodes this data, and exfiltrates it via DNS queries to a hardcoded, suspicious domain (hte1ck6lvk1ktcuxl0x8jfgeu50vok.burpcollaborator.net), which is a well-known tool for tracking and exfiltration in security testing and real-world attacks. The code also attempts to determine the external IP address of the host using both HTTP requests and shell commands (curl), which is a common step in system fingerprinting and C2 (command and control) beaconing. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user notification or consent, and the absence of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality further confirm its malicious intent. The combination of these behaviors—host profiling, data encoding, and covert exfiltration to an attacker-controlled domain—matches patterns seen exclusively in malware and supply chain attacks.",
