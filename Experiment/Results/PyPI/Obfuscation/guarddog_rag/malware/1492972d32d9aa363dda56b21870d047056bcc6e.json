      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including: (1) Heavy obfuscation: All variable and function names are meaningless, and the code structure is intentionally convoluted to hinder analysis. (2) Dynamic code execution: The code uses exec, eval, and compile in indirect and obfuscated ways, including via lambdas and dynamic string construction. (3) Encoded/obfuscated payloads: There are large blocks of seemingly random bytes (e.g., b'...') and encoded strings, which are likely compressed or encrypted payloads. (4) Use of builtins and __import__ to dynamically load modules and execute code, including the use of globals()['eval'](globals()['compile'](...)), which is a classic malware technique for executing arbitrary code. (5) The code manipulates globals and appears to write or modify global state, which can be used for persistence or further payload delivery. (6) The code contains logic to execute code during the main block, and the obfuscated logic at the end (e.g., OOOoOo0O0OOOoOooOOOOoOOo0()(XWXXXWWXXXWXWWXXX(...))) is a classic pattern for executing a final payload after decoding or decompressing it. (7) The code includes multiple try/except blocks that suppress errors, a common anti-analysis and evasion technique. (8) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation; all code is focused on obfuscation and dynamic execution. (9) The code is structured to run during import or execution, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malicious packages. (10) The presence of code that decodes, decompresses, and immediately executes data is a critical risk pattern seen exclusively in malware. In summary, this code is highly likely to be malicious, designed to deliver and execute a hidden payload, and evade detection through obfuscation and dynamic execution.",
