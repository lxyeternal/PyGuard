      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command (Install) that is executed automatically during package installation. In the run() method, it decodes a base64-encoded domain ('d3d3LmRsMDEucHduei5vcmc=' → 'www.dl01.pwnz.org'), resolves its IP address, and then calls a method (self.tesy) with the resolved IP. Although the tesy method is likely a typo for 'test' and does nothing but print a message in this sample, the structure and obfuscation (base64 encoding of the domain, custom install hook) are classic hallmarks of supply chain attacks and malware. The code is designed to execute during installation, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. The use of a suspicious, non-corporate domain and obfuscation techniques, combined with execution in a supply chain context, are strong indicators of malicious intent, even if the payload is inert in this sample.",
