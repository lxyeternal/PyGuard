      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as the actual PowerShell command is hidden from static analysis and user inspection. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. The encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, is likely to download and execute a remote payload or perform other malicious actions, as indicated by the presence of a suspicious URL in the encoded string. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks where code is executed during package installation (as seen here in a setup.py context). There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command that contacts an external server.",
