This payload uses __import__('builtins').exec(__import__('builtins').compile(...)) to dynamically execute code that is base64-decoded. The decoded payload downloads and executes remote code from a suspicious URL (https://zerotwo-best-waifu.online/778112985743251/wap/enner/injector), writes it to a temporary file, and attempts to execute it, replacing the process image. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code is executed during import or class definition, with heavy obfuscation to evade detection. The use of base64 encoding, dynamic imports, and execution, as well as the presence of a hardcoded, non-corporate URL, are all strong indicators of malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a remote payload.",
