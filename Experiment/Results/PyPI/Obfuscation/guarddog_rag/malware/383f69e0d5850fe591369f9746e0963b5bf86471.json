      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com) without user consent or notification. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it exfiltrates host-specific data during package installation. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, lack of legitimate business logic, and the embedding of this behavior in the installation process further confirm malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package to exfiltrate such information during installation, and this pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples.",
