      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known malware and supply chain attack patterns. Specifically: (1) It downloads files from hardcoded, suspicious external URLs (http://52.14.229.35:1122/connect-CANDC.txt and http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg), which are not associated with any legitimate software distribution. (2) The downloaded files are written to disk and then executed as batch files via subprocess.Popen with shell=True, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source. (3) The code attempts to install the 'requests' library at runtime if not present, ensuring its network capabilities even on clean systems. (4) It uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions, which are common evasion techniques in malware. (5) The malicious logic is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (6) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for these actions. (7) The code attempts to clean up evidence by deleting the batch files after execution. (8) The use of 'net session' and privilege checks suggests attempts to escalate privileges or adapt behavior based on system context. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign, open-source Python packages.",
