      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the installation/setup phase (likely triggered by setup.py). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a classic technique for hiding malicious intent. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe', and then runs them. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is designed to run automatically upon package installation, without user consent or notification, and downloads and executes potentially malicious binaries from the internet. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
