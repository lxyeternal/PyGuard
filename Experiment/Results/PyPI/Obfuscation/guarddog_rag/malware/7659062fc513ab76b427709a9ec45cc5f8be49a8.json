      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious intent. The use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' is strongly associated with malware, as it allows the execution of arbitrary commands without user visibility. The encoded command appears to download and/or execute a remote payload from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors match critical risk indicators for Python malware, especially in the context of supply chain attacks.",
