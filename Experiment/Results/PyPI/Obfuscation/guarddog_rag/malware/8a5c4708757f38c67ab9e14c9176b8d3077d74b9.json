      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a Windows executable ('trex.exe') from a hardcoded, suspicious Discord CDN URL, writes it to disk as 'launcher.exe', executes it immediately using os.system, and then deletes the file. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary without user interaction, validation, or consent—is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The use of a non-corporate, non-official domain (Discord CDN), lack of integrity checks, and absence of any legitimate business logic or user-facing features further confirm the malicious nature. This sequence is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source, and is not observed in benign software.",
