      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks and remote code execution. Specifically: (1) During installation (via setuptools), it automatically installs the 'gitpython' package and clones a remote GitHub repository ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') into a user directory without user consent. (2) It then changes the working directory to the cloned repository and executes a Python script ('bypass.py') from that repository using subprocess.run(['python', 'bypass.py']). This enables arbitrary code execution from a remote, potentially untrusted source, which is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern. (3) The code is triggered during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks, and there is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying these actions. (4) The use of a suspicious repository name ('NotInfected/updater.git') and a non-descriptive package name further increases suspicion. (5) The code lacks error handling, logging, or user notification, and performs all actions silently. These behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not observed in benign software.",
