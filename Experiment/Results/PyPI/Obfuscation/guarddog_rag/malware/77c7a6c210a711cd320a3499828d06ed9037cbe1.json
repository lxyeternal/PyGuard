      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information stealer targeting Roblox users. It programmatically extracts the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from multiple browsers using the browser_cookie3 library, which is a sensitive authentication token for Roblox accounts. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects additional user information (Robux balance, account age, friends, etc.) via the Roblox API. The code also collects the victim's public IP address using an external service (https://api.ipify.org/). All of this sensitive information, including the authentication cookie and IP address, is then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook (which is not a legitimate business endpoint, but a common exfiltration method for malware). The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and provides no user notification or consent. These behaviors match multiple high-confidence malware indicators: credential theft, data exfiltration, use of suspicious endpoints, and obfuscation.",
