      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It downloads a list of files from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), filters them based on the victim's operating system, and then downloads additional files (presumably executables) from the same remote server. It writes these files to disk and immediately executes them using os.system, with different commands for Linux, macOS, and Windows. There is no user interaction, consent, or notification, and no validation or integrity checking of the downloaded files. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of documentation, and the pattern of remote payload delivery and execution are all hallmarks of malware. This is a classic multi-stage malware loader pattern, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise.",
