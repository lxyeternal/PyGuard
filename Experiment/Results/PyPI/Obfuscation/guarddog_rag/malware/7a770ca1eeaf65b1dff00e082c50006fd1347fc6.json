It reads the contents of the sensitive system file '/etc/passwd', encodes the data using base64, and then sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL ('https://webhook.site/67e7e084-1921-442f-99fe-ba234f471b4e'). This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, commonly observed in malware. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user notification or consent, and suppression of all exceptions further indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to read and exfiltrate '/etc/passwd'.",
