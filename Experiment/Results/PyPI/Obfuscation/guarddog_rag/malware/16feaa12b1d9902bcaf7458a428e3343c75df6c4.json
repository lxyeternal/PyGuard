      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks and malware delivery mechanisms in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It downloads files from hardcoded, suspicious external URLs (http://52.14.229.35:1122/connect-CANDC.txt and http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg), which are not associated with any legitimate software distribution. (2) The downloaded files are written to disk and then executed as batch files via subprocess.Popen with shell=True, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source. (3) The code attempts to install the 'requests' library if not present, ensuring its own dependencies for network communication, which is a common tactic in malware to guarantee payload delivery. (4) The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (5) There is obfuscation via non-descriptive variable names and indirect subprocess parameter passing, which is typical of attempts to evade detection. (6) The code attempts to clean up after itself by deleting the executed batch files, further indicating an attempt to hide its tracks. (7) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for these actions. (8) The use of 'net session' to check for administrative privileges is a known technique for privilege escalation or to tailor payloads based on system rights. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
