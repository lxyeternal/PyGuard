      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) During installation (triggered by setuptools), it downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://77.91.77.31:6382/versions/{version_info[0]}{version_info[1]}.zip), which is not an official or reputable Python package source. (2) The downloaded ZIP is extracted to a randomly named temporary directory. (3) It then executes 'main.py' from the extracted content using 'pythonw.exe' via os.system, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted, remote source. (4) The code suppresses all exceptions and logs errors to a temp file, which is a common anti-analysis and evasion technique. (5) The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user notification, and execution of remote code during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. (6) The code is embedded in the setup script, ensuring it runs automatically upon package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies these actions.",
