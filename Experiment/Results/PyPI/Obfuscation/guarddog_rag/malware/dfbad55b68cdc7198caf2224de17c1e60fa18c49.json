It then concatenates this information, base64-encodes it, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://162.62.15.24/v/...). This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, especially when embedded in a setup script (as seen here with setuptools). The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user notification or consent, and the absence of any legitimate business logic further confirm malicious intent. The code is designed to run automatically during package installation, making it a high-severity supply chain threat.",
