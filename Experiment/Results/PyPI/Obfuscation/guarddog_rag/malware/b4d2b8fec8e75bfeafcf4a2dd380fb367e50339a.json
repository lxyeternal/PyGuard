      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a hallmark of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), writes it to disk as ini_file_pyp_41.exe, and immediately executes it via os.system('start ...'), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. (3) All of this logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, ensuring it runs automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. (4) The code uses obfuscated variable names, suppresses all exceptions (try/except: pass), and provides no user notification or consent, further indicating malicious intent. (5) The domains and file names used are not associated with any legitimate Python or open-source infrastructure. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality present. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never found in benign software.",
