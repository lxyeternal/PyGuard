      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('Setup.exe') from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a Discord CDN link), writes it to disk as 'download.exe', and then immediately executes it using os.startfile. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary without user interaction, validation, or consent—is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code uses obfuscated variable names, lacks error handling, and provides no legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation. The use of a Discord CDN for payload delivery is a common tactic in malware campaigns. There is no evidence of benign intent or business logic that would justify this behavior.",
