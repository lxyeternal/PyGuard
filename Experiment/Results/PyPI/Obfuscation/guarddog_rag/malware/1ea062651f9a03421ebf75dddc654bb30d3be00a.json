      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (likely via setup.py). The command is run only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated, but the use of '-EncodedCommand' and the presence of a suspicious, non-standard URL (dl.dropbox.com) in the decoded payload strongly indicate that it downloads and/or executes a remote file or script. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is exclusively observed in malware samples. The code is further obfuscated by suppressing all exceptions and using non-descriptive variable names. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, encoded PowerShell commands that contact external servers. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user consent.",
