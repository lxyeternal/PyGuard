      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (in the setup.py context). Specifically, it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand'. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and writes/executes files in the user's home directory (e.g., WindowsCache.exe). This is a hallmark of malware: it achieves remote code execution, payload delivery, and persistence, all without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically upon package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
