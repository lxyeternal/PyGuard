      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. First, it contains a function that executes os.system('touch /tmp/test1563.txt'), which is a shell command execution with no legitimate user-facing purpose. More critically, the function XZWmkWQqccpVwsAZXayCndGAMyDuWsEK establishes a raw socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (59.110.111.85) on port 8088, duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, and then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) with subprocess.call. This is a classic reverse shell pattern, allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, lacks any user interaction, documentation, or legitimate business logic, and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, suggesting a supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors are exclusively associated with malware and are never found in benign software, according to the provided knowledge base.",
