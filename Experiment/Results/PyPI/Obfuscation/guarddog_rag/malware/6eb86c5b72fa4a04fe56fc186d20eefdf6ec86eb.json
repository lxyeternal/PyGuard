      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, creates a directory in the Windows Startup folder (a classic persistence mechanism), clones a remote GitHub repository (https://github.com/dcsage/test2lmaos.git) into that folder, and then moves a file (test.py) into the Startup directory. This ensures that the code from the remote repository will be executed automatically every time the user logs in, without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the targeting of the Startup folder, and the execution of arbitrary code from a remote source during installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
