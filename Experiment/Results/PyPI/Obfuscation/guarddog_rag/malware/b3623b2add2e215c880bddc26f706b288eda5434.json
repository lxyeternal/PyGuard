      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (ANiTLtMqAuyEWjduPFGfMebXtTLMLJSz) that is executed automatically during package installation. The install hook calls LubXuzuKJfaqkbYArlioXYmCUGTPZvNP, which collects sensitive system information (system uptime, OS details, platform, and local IP address) and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64:9090) via a raw TCP socket. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during installation, collects host fingerprinting data, and sends it to an attacker-controlled server without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated function and class names, lack of documentation, and absence of legitimate business logic further confirm malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware targeting the software supply chain.",
