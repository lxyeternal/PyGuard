This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is a critical risk pattern. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and is likely used to download and execute a remote payload from a suspicious URL (as indicated by the encoded command). The use of subprocess.Popen with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' is a classic technique for stealthy execution of malicious code. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute such a command, especially in a hidden window and with obfuscated content. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never seen in benign software.",
