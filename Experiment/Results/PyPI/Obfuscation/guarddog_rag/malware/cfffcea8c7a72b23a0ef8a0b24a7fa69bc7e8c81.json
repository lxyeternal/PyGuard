      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (oJMcMvAIKSoXDclckMsXmKVATnOMvWHR) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern—decryption followed by execution during installation—is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is never seen in benign packages. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during install time is a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload on victim systems.",
