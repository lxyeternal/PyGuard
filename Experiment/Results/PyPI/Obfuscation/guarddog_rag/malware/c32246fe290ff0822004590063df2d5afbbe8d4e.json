      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (QHUbhxxopfmSTgfXYvbGNQFlofqiXUBU) that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only revealed and executed at install time, which can result in arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and detection.",
