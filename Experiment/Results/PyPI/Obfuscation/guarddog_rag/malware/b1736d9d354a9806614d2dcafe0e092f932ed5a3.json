      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the installation/setup phase (via distutils.core.setup). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then executes them. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, downloads and runs potentially malicious executables, and uses obfuscation and exception suppression to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions, and all observed behaviors (obfuscation, remote payload delivery, hidden execution, lack of user consent, and execution during install) are strongly associated with malware.",
