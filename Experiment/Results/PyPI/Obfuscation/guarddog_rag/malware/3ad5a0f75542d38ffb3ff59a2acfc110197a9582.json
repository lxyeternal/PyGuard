      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command (PDPTZggWKagqlxUiLeravsXmMVgItHbC) that, when triggered during package installation, collects sensitive system information: the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (cdf7ymt2vtc0000eer0gggz6haayyyyyf.oast.fun), which is not associated with any legitimate service and is commonly used for testing or malicious exfiltration (e.g., via Burp Collaborator or OAST). The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive class and variable names, and there is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data collection and transmission. Embedding this behavior in a setup.py install hook is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it executes automatically on user systems during package installation. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and is a critical indicator of malicious activity.",
