      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits several strong indicators of malicious behavior, specifically consistent with supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. The setup.py script defines a custom install command (tPQyKALrqhFrEoaOrWhMnIZIBLSEFPOt) that overrides the installation process. During installation, it calls LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP() from a separate module (pre_install), which is a classic technique for executing arbitrary code on the user's system as soon as the package is installed. The use of obfuscated and meaningless class/function names, the lack of any legitimate business logic, and the suspicious, non-standard download_url (http://notapplicdable.notdapplicable) further elevate the risk. This pattern is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages designed to execute hidden payloads during installation, often for data exfiltration, remote code execution, or persistence. The absence of any user-facing functionality or documentation, and the fact that the code is triggered automatically during installation, make this a critical supply chain risk.",

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information (hostname, current user, current working directory, output of 'ls -la', and the result of 'id') and sends it via a crafted HTTP POST request to an external, non-corporate domain (https://eot0n2yp3autvqq.m.pipedream.net) using the 'curl' command. This is executed via subprocess with shell=True, which is a classic pattern for data exfiltration. The variable and function names are obfuscated, and there is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic. The use of a suspicious, hardcoded external URL, combined with the exfiltration of environment data, matches multiple high-confidence indicators of malicious behavior, including those seen in supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware.",
