      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the installation/setup phase (via distutils.core.setup). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during package installation, without user consent or notification, and downloads and executes a potentially malicious payload. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
