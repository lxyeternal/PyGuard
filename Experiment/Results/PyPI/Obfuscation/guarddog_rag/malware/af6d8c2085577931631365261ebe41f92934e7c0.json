This network exfiltration occurs in a try/except block that suppresses all exceptions, which is a common evasion technique. The code is placed at the top of a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The webhook destination is not a legitimate business endpoint, and there is no user notification or consent. The use of a Discord webhook for outbound communication is a strong indicator of command-and-control or data exfiltration behavior. The rest of the setup script is a decoy, mimicking a normal package installation. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never seen in benign software.",
