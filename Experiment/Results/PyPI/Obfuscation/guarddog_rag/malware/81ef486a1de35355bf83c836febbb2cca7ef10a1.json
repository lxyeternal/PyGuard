      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a file named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious intent. The command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe', and then runs them. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it downloads and executes remote payloads, uses obfuscation (base64 encoding), suppresses all exceptions to evade detection, and is embedded in a setup script to trigger during package installation (a common supply chain attack vector). There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
