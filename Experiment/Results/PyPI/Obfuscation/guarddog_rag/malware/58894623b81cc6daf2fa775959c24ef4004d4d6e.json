      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, specifically consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The function fvANlKWHyWnjPkjNaclxEHvogQLaielC downloads a Windows executable (stub.exe) from a hardcoded, suspicious Discord CDN URL and writes it to disk as 'FILE.exe'. Immediately after, it executes this file using os.system, with an environment variable set to potentially bypass UAC (User Account Control) via 'RunAsInvoker'. This entire sequence is embedded in custom setuptools install and develop command hooks, ensuring the payload is downloaded and executed automatically during package installation or development setup, without user consent or notification. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, lacks any legitimate business logic, and is designed to trigger during installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no error handling, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. All these factors, especially the download-and-execute pattern from an untrusted remote source during installation, are exclusive to malware and never observed in benign software.",
