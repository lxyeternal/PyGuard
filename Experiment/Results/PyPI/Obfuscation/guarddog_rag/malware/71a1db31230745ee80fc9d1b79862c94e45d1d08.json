      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py context). Specifically, it checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during package installation, is obfuscated, downloads and runs a remote executable, and attempts to evade detection by hiding the PowerShell window and suppressing all exceptions. These behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
