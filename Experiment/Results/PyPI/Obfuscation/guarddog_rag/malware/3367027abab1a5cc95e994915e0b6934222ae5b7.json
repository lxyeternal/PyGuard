      "malicious_behavior": "The code is clearly malicious. It uses heavy obfuscation: a single-line print statement is followed by a semicolon and a call to __import__('builtins').exec(), which dynamically executes code. The code to be executed is base64-decoded and compiled at runtime. The decoded payload (when decoded) performs the following actions: (1) It imports modules for temporary file creation, system command execution, and HTTP requests. (2) It downloads additional code from hardcoded, suspicious IP addresses (http://20.226.18.203/grab/ry2K1CIVRSFa59vT and http://20.226.18.203/clip), writes the downloaded content to a temporary file, and attempts to execute it as a process. (3) It uses try/except blocks to suppress errors, a common anti-analysis technique. (4) The code is designed to run automatically, likely during package installation or import, with no user interaction or notification. (5) The use of obfuscated imports, dynamic code execution, and hardcoded external URLs is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. (6) There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python supply chain attacks.",
