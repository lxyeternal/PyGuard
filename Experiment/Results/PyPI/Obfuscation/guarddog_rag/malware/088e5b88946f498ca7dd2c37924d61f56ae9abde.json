      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, as the code is embedded in a setup script and will execute during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
