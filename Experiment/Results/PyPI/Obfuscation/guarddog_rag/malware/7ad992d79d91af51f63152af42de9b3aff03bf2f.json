      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (VEsqCKJYuWEuTmwvwZQBoWkxssGacqgR) that, when the package is installed (e.g., via pip), executes the function XeVJvIWahDFKpUWFdQzmLkuQWvJCFYtO. This function collects the current username (os.getlogin()) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded IP address (194.233.164.169), which is not a legitimate or well-known domain. This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, commonly seen in supply chain attacks via malicious PyPI packages. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable and class names, and the exfiltration is performed without user consent, logging, or documentation. The use of a custom install hook to execute this logic during package installation is a hallmark of Python supply chain malware.",
