      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded PowerShell command decodes to a script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and running it. This is a textbook example of a malware dropper: it downloads and executes a potentially malicious executable without user consent or notification. The code is triggered during package installation (setup.py context), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. All these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, remote payload download, execution during install, and error suppression—are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
