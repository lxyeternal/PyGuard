      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (likely via setup.py). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of subprocess.Popen to run a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, especially during package installation, is a hallmark of malware. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior. The path existence check for 'tahg' is likely used as a marker to avoid repeated execution. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, encoded PowerShell commands, and this pattern is never observed in benign software. This is a critical risk and strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of supply chain attacks.",
