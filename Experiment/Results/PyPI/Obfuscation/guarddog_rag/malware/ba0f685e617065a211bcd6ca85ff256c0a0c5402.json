      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes subprocess.run(['python', 'junior']) at the top level of the setup script, which will run whenever the package is installed or the setup script is executed. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, where arbitrary code is executed during installation without user consent. The executed command ('python', 'junior') attempts to run a Python script or module named 'junior', which may not exist on the victim's system or could be dropped by another stage of the attack. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation, a critical risk vector. The package name ('dttrccrpgi4z8aja') is also non-descriptive and suspicious, further supporting the likelihood of malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute an unrelated Python process in this manner, especially without user interaction, documentation, or error handling.",
