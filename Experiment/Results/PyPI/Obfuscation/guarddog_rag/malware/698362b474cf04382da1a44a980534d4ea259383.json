      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It attempts to extract the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library, which is a classic technique for credential theft. The .ROBLOSECURITY cookie is a sensitive authentication token for Roblox accounts. The code then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects additional user information (Robux balance, account age, RAP, friends, etc.) via the Roblox API. It also collects the victim's public IP address using an external service (https://api.ipify.org/). All of this sensitive information, including the authentication cookie and IP address, is then exfiltrated via a Discord webhook (hardcoded in the variable KxFYjtMjKlXabHrSExMlKDaTSgtrSlGG). The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and provides no user notification or consent. These are all strong indicators of credential-stealing malware.",
