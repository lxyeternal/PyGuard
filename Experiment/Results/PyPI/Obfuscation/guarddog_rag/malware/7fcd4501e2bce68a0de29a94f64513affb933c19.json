      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It downloads a ZIP file from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (https://frvezdffvvvv.pythonanywhere.com/getpip), extracts its contents to the user's APPDATA directory, and then moves and executes a batch file (NewSetup.bat) in a randomly named subdirectory within APPDATA. The execution is performed with subprocess.Popen and the window is hidden (CREATE_NO_WINDOW), which is a common technique to avoid user detection. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, lacks user interaction, logging, or legitimate business logic, and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, making it likely to execute during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). There is no validation or integrity checking of the downloaded content, and the use of random directory names and hidden execution further increases suspicion. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
