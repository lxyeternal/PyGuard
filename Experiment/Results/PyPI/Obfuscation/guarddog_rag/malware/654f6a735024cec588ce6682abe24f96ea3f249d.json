      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern. In the setup script, before calling the legitimate setup() function, it checks if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist. If so, it executes a PowerShell command via subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The command is base64-encoded, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware to hide its true intent. Decoding the base64 reveals that the PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then executes them. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and runs remote executables without user consent, uses obfuscation, and is triggered during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to perform these actions.",
