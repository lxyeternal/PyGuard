      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a Windows executable ('launcher.exe') from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a Discord CDN link), writes it to disk, executes it immediately using os.system, and then deletes the file. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. There is no user interaction, validation, or integrity checking of the downloaded file, and the executable is run without user consent. The use of a Discord CDN for payload delivery is a common tactic in malware campaigns to evade detection. This sequence (download, write, execute, delete) is strongly associated with malware and is not observed in benign software. The absence of any legitimate business logic, documentation, or user-facing features further confirms the malicious nature of this code.",
