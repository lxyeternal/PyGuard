      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (GHSjvaaPYKbWFGoockKIlQQLSChbBtGZ) that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python: it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, with the actual payload hidden and obfuscated via encryption. The use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, and the absence of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality further confirm the malicious intent. The code is designed to run only on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), which is a common targeting technique. The presence of 'requests' suggests the decrypted payload may perform network operations, such as data exfiltration or further payload retrieval. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of malicious PyPI packages.",
