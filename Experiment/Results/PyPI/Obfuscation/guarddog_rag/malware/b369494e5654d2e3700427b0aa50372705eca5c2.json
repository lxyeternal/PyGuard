      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: (1) Heavy obfuscation is present throughout, including meaningless variable and function names, indirect references, and lambda chains. (2) There is dynamic code execution via exec and eval, including the use of compile and indirect string construction to hide the executed code. (3) The code decompresses or decodes binary blobs and then executes them, a classic malware pattern for payload delivery. (4) There are lambda functions that decode and execute code using globals()['eval'](globals()['compile'](...)), with the code string itself being obfuscated via hex escapes. (5) The code uses __import__('zlib') and other dynamic imports, which are commonly used to evade static analysis. (6) The code is structured to run these behaviors during the main execution block, and the obfuscation is clearly intended to hide the true intent. (7) There are no legitimate user-facing features, documentation, or business logic; all code is focused on obfuscation and dynamic execution. (8) The code includes hardcoded binary blobs and suspicious string keys, which are likely used for further payloads or configuration. (9) The code matches multiple critical risk patterns from the knowledge base, including multi-layered decoding and immediate execution, dynamic code evaluation, and obfuscated payload delivery.",
