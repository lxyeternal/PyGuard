      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware, specifically a Discord token stealer. It programmatically searches for Discord authentication tokens and browser-stored tokens on the victim's machine by scanning known directories (Discord, Chrome, Opera, Brave, Yandex, etc.) for LevelDB files. It extracts tokens using regular expressions, then exfiltrates the collected tokens to hardcoded Discord webhook URLs controlled by the attacker. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection, and is designed to run automatically (potentially during package installation, as it is embedded in a setup.py-like script). There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this behavior. The use of hardcoded webhooks, targeting of sensitive directories, and automated exfiltration of credentials are all strong indicators of malicious intent, matching multiple critical risk patterns described in the knowledge base.",
