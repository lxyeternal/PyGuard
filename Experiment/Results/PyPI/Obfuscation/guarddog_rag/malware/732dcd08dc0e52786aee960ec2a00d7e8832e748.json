It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to an external, suspicious domain (http://5r13v9.ceye.io) without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the lack of any legitimate business logic, and the execution of this code during package installation are all hallmarks of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of malicious intent, specifically for automated data exfiltration and host fingerprinting.",
