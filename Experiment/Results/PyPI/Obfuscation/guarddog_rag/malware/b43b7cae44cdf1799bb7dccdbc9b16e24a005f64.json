It collects sensitive system information (package name, hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious domain ('for-research.ru') via DNS queries. The exfiltration is obfuscated by encoding the data as hex and splitting it into chunks, which are then sent as DNS queries to a subdomain controlled by the attacker. The code is embedded in custom setuptools install, develop, and egg_info hooks, ensuring it runs automatically during package installation or metadata generation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user notification, and the absence of any legitimate business logic further confirm its malicious intent.",
