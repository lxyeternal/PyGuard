      "malicious_behavior": "This code implements a classic reverse shell. It connects to a hardcoded external IP address (3.228.3.164) on port 80, redirects the standard input, output, and error streams to the socket, and then spawns a bash shell using pty.spawn('/bin/bash'). This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the compromised system with the privileges of the running process. The use of os.putenv('HISTFILE', '/dev/null') is an anti-forensics measure to prevent command history from being saved. There is no user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic present. The combination of hardcoded external host, shell spawning, and I/O redirection is a strong, exclusive indicator of malicious remote access (malware_ratio: 1.0, benign_ratio: 0.0).",
