      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the setup phase of a Python package (likely during installation). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the payload. The PowerShell command downloads and/or executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it to a hidden or user directory, and may execute it. The use of try/except to suppress all errors, the check for a non-descriptive directory ('tahg'), and the execution of a hidden process with obfuscated parameters are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
