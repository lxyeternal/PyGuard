      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits several hallmarks of malicious behavior, specifically those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. The function OYLUdRBUypdEtyQBEXgxjcLnDDuPWAmK collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (host-specific information) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php). This is a classic data exfiltration technique used for system fingerprinting or tracking installations. The code is executed automatically during package installation by overriding the setuptools install command (via the aynTTzVWDgpujgpRlFdrYNGlgbbsMbou class and cmdclass in setup()), ensuring the exfiltration occurs without user knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, lack of user notification, and suppression of all exceptions further indicate an attempt to evade detection and hide malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
