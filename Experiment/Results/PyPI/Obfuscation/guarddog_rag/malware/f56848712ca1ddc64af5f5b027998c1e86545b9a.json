      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or malicious commands on a victim's system. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, which is a strong indicator of intent to evade detection and deliver a secondary payload. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware, especially in supply chain attacks where code is executed during package installation (as seen here in a setup.py context). There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute a hidden, encoded PowerShell command, and the code lacks any user notification, documentation, or business logic to justify such behavior.",
