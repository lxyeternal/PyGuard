      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (STMLNaQkNVipaKtAiTAyOJpuvtBknfjF) that, when triggered during package installation, imports the requests module and sends a GET request to 'https://ipinfo.io/json', printing the result. This exfiltrates the installer's public IP address and related geolocation data to an external server without user consent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages, as it collects host-specific information during installation, which is never justified in benign software. The obfuscated class and variable names further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code is designed to execute automatically during installation, making it a critical risk for users who install this package.",
