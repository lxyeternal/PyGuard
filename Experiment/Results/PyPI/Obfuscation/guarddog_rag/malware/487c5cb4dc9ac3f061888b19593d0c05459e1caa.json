It creates a temporary file containing Python code that downloads and executes additional code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/qgu3e/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. The code then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system call, with obfuscated variable names and suppressed exceptions to evade detection. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware, as it enables arbitrary code from an untrusted, external source to be executed on the victim's machine during package installation. The use of exec on network-fetched data, lack of user interaction or consent, obfuscation, and execution during setup are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
