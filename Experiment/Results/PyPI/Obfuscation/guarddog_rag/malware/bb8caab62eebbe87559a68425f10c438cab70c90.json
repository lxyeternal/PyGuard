      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with malware and supply chain attacks. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command that executes automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (2) During installation, it downloads two files from a suspicious, non-corporate domain ('https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe' and 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll'), which are likely to be malicious payloads. (3) It writes these files to a temporary directory, then immediately executes the downloaded executable ('ComServer.exe') using os.system, passing a suspicious argument ('showdeskband'). (4) The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable and class names, a common evasion technique. (5) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for these actions. (6) The use of a DLL file alongside an EXE is consistent with DLL hijacking or persistence techniques. (7) All of these behaviors are executed automatically upon installation, without user interaction, and are never seen in benign Python packages. This is a textbook example of a malicious PyPI package designed to compromise user systems during installation.",
