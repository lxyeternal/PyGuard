      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (QvKNRXxuFZNWByiNwKHHmcpYvaXffcON) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key to decrypt an encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks: it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, with the actual payload hidden and obfuscated via encryption. The use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, and execution of decrypted code during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and detection.",
