      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (SlqmzuvxGQuXGorfoeKkyhHZNvMbuNDD) that, when triggered during package installation, downloads an executable ('normal.exe') from a suspicious, non-corporate URL ('https://tryg.ga/normal.exe') and immediately executes it using Popen. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is exclusively observed in malware samples. The code is obfuscated with meaningless class and variable names, lacks user notification or consent, and provides no legitimate business logic for downloading and executing a remote binary. The use of a custom install command in setup.py to trigger this behavior during installation is a critical risk vector, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge. All these behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators for Python malware, especially in the context of supply chain attacks.",
