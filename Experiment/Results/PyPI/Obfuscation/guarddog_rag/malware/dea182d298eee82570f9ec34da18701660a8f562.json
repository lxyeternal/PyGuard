It collects all environment variables from the victim's system (using os.environ), encodes them, and sends them to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://6f69-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app') without user consent. The exfiltration is triggered automatically during package installation, development, or egg_info commands by overriding setuptools command classes (install, develop, egg_info) and calling the data-exfiltrating function in their hooks. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is embedded in a Python package's setup script to steal sensitive information from any system where the package is installed. The use of obfuscated function and class names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to exfiltrate environment data to an external server, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware.",
