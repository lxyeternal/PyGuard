      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses base64 encoding to obfuscate a function that executes arbitrary shell commands via subprocess, a classic malware technique to evade detection. Critically, during installation (in the setup.py context), it checks for the existence of a directory (C:/ProgramData/Updater) and, if not present, downloads a ZIP file from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (https://transfer.sh/WULklK/Updater.zip) using PowerShell. It then extracts this archive to a system directory, installs a list of Python packages (some of which are commonly abused in malware), and launches a potentially malicious script (server.pyw) via a hidden process. The use of WScript.exe and launch.vbs for persistence or stealthy execution is also a hallmark of Windows malware. There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for these actions. The combination of obfuscation, remote payload download, execution, and persistence mechanisms is a textbook example of a supply chain attack via a malicious Python package.",
