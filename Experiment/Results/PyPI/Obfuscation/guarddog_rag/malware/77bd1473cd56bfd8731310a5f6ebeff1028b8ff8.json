The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with '-WindowStyle Hidden', which hides the window from the user. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe', and then runs them. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, often used in supply chain attacks via malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote executables in this manner.",
