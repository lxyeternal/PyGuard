      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a classic system fingerprinting and data exfiltration technique. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it using os.system('start ...'), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. (3) All of this is triggered automatically during package installation by hijacking the setuptools install command, ensuring the payload runs without user consent or awareness. (4) The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses all exceptions (hiding errors or detection), and provides no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software, especially in the context of Python package installation scripts.",
