This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is a critical risk pattern. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of subprocess.Popen with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' is strongly associated with malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent or visibility. The try/except block suppresses all errors, further hiding malicious activity. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, especially in the context of Python package installation.",
