      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious intent. The use of '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' is strongly associated with malware, as it allows the execution of arbitrary, potentially harmful commands without user knowledge or consent. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The try/except block suppresses all errors, further hiding its activity. The presence of a suspicious, non-descriptive package name and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality further support the conclusion that this is malicious code.",
