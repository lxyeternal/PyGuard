      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the package installation process (in the setup.py context). Specifically, it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is triggered during installation, downloads and runs a remote executable, and does so without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscation, hidden execution, and remote payload delivery are all strong indicators of malware, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
