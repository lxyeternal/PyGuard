It collects sensitive system information, including the environment variable keys, the system's uname (which includes hostname and OS details), the current Python stack trace, and the external IP address (via a request to https://ipinfo.io/ip). It then exfiltrates this data to a remote server whose URL is obfuscated using base64 encoding (decoded to a non-standard, non-corporate domain: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/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1'). The code is designed to avoid execution on certain hostnames or when run from specific filenames, which is a common anti-analysis and evasion technique. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding, and the lack of user notification or consent further reinforce the malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality; the sole purpose of the code is to steal and exfiltrate host information. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially supply chain attacks and information stealers.",
