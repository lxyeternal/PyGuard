      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the installation/setup phase (via distutils.core.setup). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the payload. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malware delivery: it enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and persistence, all without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. The code is triggered during package installation, making it especially dangerous as it can compromise systems via the Python package ecosystem.",
