      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects the victim's computer name from the environment and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a hallmark of host fingerprinting and C2 communication. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start ...'), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. (3) All of this is triggered automatically during package installation by hijacking the setuptools install command, ensuring the payload runs without user consent or awareness. (4) The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses all exceptions (hiding errors or detection), and provides no legitimate user-facing functionality. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software, especially in the context of Python package installation scripts.",
