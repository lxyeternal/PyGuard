In its nLUPjqEulXpWAEpzlkAxKLPqNQqXvgiT method, it collects sensitive host information (hostname, local IP address, and detailed platform/system information) and exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL ('https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1040010700677988502/-NIIPOoDdImwivYH43PiNxcvlGho7Dt1lZg3IG7U4IZbvkq7eQj6d_5eYqyFDjVo88wB'). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during installation, requires no user interaction, and leaks system information to an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of obfuscated class and method names, lack of user notification, and the presence of a suspicious webhook further confirm malicious intent.",
