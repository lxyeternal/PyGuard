      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It collects sensitive system information (output of 'uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', and 'ifconfig'), which includes OS details, user identity, current directory, and network configuration. (2) It encodes this information using base64, a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. (3) It constructs a URL containing the encoded data and sends a request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http:/81.70.191.194:14333/start/...), using 'curl' via os.system, which is a classic data exfiltration method. (4) This behavior is triggered automatically during the setup process (i.e., when the package is installed), without user consent, logging, or legitimate business justification. (5) The code uses obfuscated variable names and is embedded in a setup script, further indicating an attempt to hide its true purpose. All of these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
