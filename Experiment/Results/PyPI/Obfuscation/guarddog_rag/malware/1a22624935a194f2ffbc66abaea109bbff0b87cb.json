It defines a custom setuptools install command (FUVEnIMAVDtikArZJeACkJFeMOoVZzcf) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows and then dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet'. It uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only decrypted and executed at install time, and can perform arbitrary actions on the victim's machine. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic code execution, and execution during installation (without user consent or notification) are all strong indicators of malware. The obfuscated variable names, lack of legitimate business logic, and targeting of Windows systems further support this assessment.",
