      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the setup phase of a Python package. The command is obfuscated and is run only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a long base64 string is a classic malware pattern for delivering and executing a secondary payload, often used to download and run additional malicious code or establish persistence. The subprocess is launched with the window hidden (likely using CREATE_NO_WINDOW), further indicating an attempt to evade user detection. The code is wrapped in a try/except block that suppresses all errors, another hallmark of malicious code seeking to avoid detection or interruption. This behavior is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute automatically upon package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of a suspicious, non-descriptive package name and the lack of any legitimate business logic further confirm the malicious intent.",
