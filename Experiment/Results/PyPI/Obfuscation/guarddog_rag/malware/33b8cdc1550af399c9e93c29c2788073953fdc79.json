      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a function (xRuTWflEcJnzYxDfWkqPZdhnRPdQZpWh) that collects all environment variables from the victim's system (using os.environ), encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/8f782c5b-990f-4d3d-94cc-fd128b873693). This function is executed automatically during both the 'develop' and 'install' phases of the package installation by overriding the setuptools install and develop commands. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the malicious code is triggered upon package installation, exfiltrating sensitive system information without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, lack of user notification, and the presence of a suspicious external endpoint further confirm the malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of information-stealing malware.",
