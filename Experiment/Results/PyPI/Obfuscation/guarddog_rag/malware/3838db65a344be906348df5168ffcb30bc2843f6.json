      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (MPzJJeDRBYlnNdxvxwVTMOqXzZUNRPen) that executes during package installation. In the install hook, it constructs a reverse shell command that connects to a hardcoded external IP address (121.4.154.240) and port (4501), giving remote shell access to the attacker. The command is base64-encoded and then executed via os.system('echo %s|base64 -d|bash'), a classic obfuscation and payload delivery technique. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding, and execution of a reverse shell are all strong indicators of malicious intent, and there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality present.",
