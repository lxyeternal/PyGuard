      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (hCwdyFQBGhynNEoDhNkjUBtjfWudCPRx) that is executed automatically during package installation. In its install routine, it collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, username, local IP addresses, and directory listings of root and home directories. It then encodes and aggregates this data, and exfiltrates it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent or notification. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and suppresses exceptions to evade detection. The use of a custom install command in setup.py to execute this logic is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
