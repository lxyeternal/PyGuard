      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (FxRAJmkiSBlFhKifelkepLmtxnqarxAC) that registers a function (EZXhFGZsoueZkLXCqVvJRCxAMFYHxUVX) to be executed at process exit, which is triggered during package installation. (2) The function collects sensitive host information: external IP address (via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')), hostname (os.uname()[1]), and the installation path. (3) This information is then base64-encoded and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (kotko.org) with a hardcoded path and query string. (4) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data exfiltration. (5) The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and is embedded in the setup script, ensuring it runs automatically on install, a classic supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign open-source packages.",
