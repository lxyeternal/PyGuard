It defines a custom setuptools install command (rFDBbDvtHqpCffVlrrVMiXCBtPumvWEK) that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python: it enables arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation, with the payload hidden and obfuscated via encryption. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during install time is strongly associated with malware and is never seen in benign packages. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload, potentially enabling remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise.",
