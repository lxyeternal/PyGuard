      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as the actual PowerShell command is hidden from static analysis. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. The encoded PowerShell command appears to download and execute a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will run automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
