      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command (BlPtJQQARuNWwkrewvYdUkiNngIsqnlY) that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive system information: the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then sends this data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eomreq4blox8fea.m.pipedream.net) without user consent or notification. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, as it exfiltrates host-specific data during package installation. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the lack of legitimate business logic, and the embedding of this behavior in the install hook further confirm malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a package to exfiltrate this information during installation, and this pattern is never observed in benign software.",
