This exfiltration of user information occurs automatically during the setup process (i.e., when the package is installed via setuptools). The function QjuiGUnHwoMunSOCudrWWCedDwZjidMK is called both before and after the setup() call, and also in the exception handler, ensuring that user and environment information is sent regardless of installation success or failure. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, suppresses all exceptions (hiding errors or detection), and provides no user notification or consent for this data transfer. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware, as it enables automated data exfiltration during package installation without user awareness.",
