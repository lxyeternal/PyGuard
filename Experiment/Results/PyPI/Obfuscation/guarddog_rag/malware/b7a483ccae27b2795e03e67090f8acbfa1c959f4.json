      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in Python packages. Key points: (1) The custom install command (SLnDxMDyhIkrtKoRXWVlfiMmzLRWaQPh) executes a base64-decoded payload during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain malware. (2) The decoded payload (when base64-decoded) contains logic to collect system information (e.g., platform/system name), rename files, and execute shell commands, and attempts to download and execute further code from remote servers. (3) The code makes HTTP requests to suspicious, non-corporate domains (e.g., grabify.link, which is commonly used for IP logging and tracking), and exfiltrates host information without user consent. (4) The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding, and dynamic code execution (via exec) is a classic malware evasion technique. (5) The code is triggered during installation (via setup.py), meaning it will execute on any system where the package is installed, without user knowledge. (6) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying these actions. (7) The code matches multiple critical risk patterns: code execution during install, exfiltration of system info, obfuscation, and remote payload retrieval. All these factors confirm this is malicious code.",
