      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without revealing its intent in the source code. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except blocks to suppress all exceptions further hides errors and potential detection. The PowerShell command is encoded, making it difficult to immediately determine its purpose, but this pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks where code is executed during package installation (as seen here, embedded in a setup script). There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior.",
