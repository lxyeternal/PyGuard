      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects sensitive system information (output of 'uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', and 'ifconfig'), which includes OS details, user identity, current directory, and network configuration. (2) It encodes this information using base64, a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. (3) It constructs a URL containing the encoded data and sends it to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (81.70.191.194:14333) using a shell-invoked 'curl' command, exfiltrating the collected data without user consent. (4) This behavior is triggered during the setup process (i.e., on package installation), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (5) The code uses obfuscated variable names and lacks any legitimate user-facing functionality or documentation justifying this data collection and exfiltration. (6) The combination of system reconnaissance, data encoding, and exfiltration to a remote server is a critical risk pattern observed exclusively in malware samples and never in benign software. (7) The use of os.popen and os.system for command execution and network communication further elevates the risk, as these APIs are commonly abused for remote code execution and data theft.",
