It defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, executes a shell command ('whoami') to obtain the current system username. It then sends this username, along with the package name, via an HTTP POST request to an external, non-corporate URL ('https://vigneshsb.me/test.php') without user consent or notification. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: exfiltrating host-specific information during installation, which is a hallmark of Python malware and is never seen in benign packages. The use of obfuscated class and variable names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
