      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with Python malware and supply chain attacks. Specifically: (1) It defines a payload (PFnGcjJXZbcIThtsvvCHGsXRJJZepEuY) that implements a reverse shell, connecting to a hardcoded external IP address (82.157.252.61:1234), allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. (2) The payload is written to a file ('remote-access.py') in the user's home or Documents directory, then executed in a subprocess during the installation process via a custom setuptools install command (gMXqmeqMRVRGDIPqEuNRsPUnAsRUNNmM). (3) The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and suppresses exceptions to evade detection. (4) The malicious payload is triggered automatically upon package installation, without user consent or notification, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (5) The setup() call uses a suspicious, meaningless package name and keywords ('remoteaccess', 'vulnerability'), further indicating malicious intent. (6) The code provides no legitimate user-facing functionality and is solely designed to establish unauthorized remote access. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and never in benign software.",
