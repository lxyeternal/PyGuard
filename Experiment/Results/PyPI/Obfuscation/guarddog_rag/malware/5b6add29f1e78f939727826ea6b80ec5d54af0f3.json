      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (kOXLYNLykbGHmvJPjSaFIuYxelBIwQLI) that, when triggered during package installation, creates a reverse shell to a hardcoded external IP address (85.159.212.47) and port (61985). It does this by creating a socket connection, redirecting standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawning a shell (/bin/sh) with pty.spawn. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine as soon as the package is installed, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the lack of any legitimate business logic, and the embedding of this behavior in the install hook are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware and is never present in benign software.",
