      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. During installation (triggered by 'install' or 'bdist' commands), it downloads a ZIP file from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://77.91.77.31:6382/versions/{version_info[0]}{version_info[1]}.zip), masquerading as a legitimate package resource. The code disables SSL verification, further increasing risk. The downloaded ZIP is extracted to a randomly named temporary directory, and then a Python process is launched to execute 'main.py' from the extracted content, all without user consent or notification. This enables arbitrary remote code execution on the victim's machine. The code also attempts to clean up after itself to evade detection and logs errors to a temp file, suppressing exceptions. These behaviors—remote payload download, execution during install, obfuscated variable names, lack of user interaction, and use of a non-official server—are strongly and exclusively associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
