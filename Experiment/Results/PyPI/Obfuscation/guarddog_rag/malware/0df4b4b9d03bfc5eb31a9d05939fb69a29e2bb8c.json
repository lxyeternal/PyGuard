This is a classic malware technique for obfuscating and executing arbitrary or remote code, often used to download and run additional payloads or establish persistence. The use of try/except to suppress all errors, the lack of user interaction or notification, the obfuscated command, and the execution during what appears to be a package installation (setup.py context) are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is highly suspicious and is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
