      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It downloads a list of filenames from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), then for each filename, constructs a URL to download an executable from the same IP address. The downloaded content is written to disk, and then executed using os.system, with platform-specific logic for Linux, macOS, and Windows. There is no user interaction, consent, or validation of the downloaded files. The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, lacks error handling, and is structured to evade detection. This pattern—downloading and executing remote payloads from an untrusted source—is a hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks or loader malware. The use of direct IP addresses, lack of documentation, and absence of legitimate business logic further confirm the malicious intent.",
