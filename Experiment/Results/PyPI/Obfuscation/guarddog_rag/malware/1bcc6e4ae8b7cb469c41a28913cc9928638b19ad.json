It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.startfile. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary without user interaction, validation, or consent—is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code lacks any user notification, integrity checks, or legitimate business logic, and the function and variable names are obfuscated, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. This behavior is strongly associated with malware and is not observed in benign software.",
