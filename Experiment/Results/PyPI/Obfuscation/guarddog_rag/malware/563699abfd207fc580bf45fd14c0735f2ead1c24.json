      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, specifically consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution. The function kbMguXvlsqJsErZYJUWgAXZRPJiDeLuQ downloads an executable (Cleaner.exe) from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://a4a08d21-3950-435e-8b39-12ab7788cd10.id.repl.co/Cleaner.exe) using the requests library, writes it to disk, and immediately executes it via os.system. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source. Furthermore, this function is called automatically during both the 'develop' and 'install' phases of the package setup process by overriding setuptools command classes, meaning the malicious payload is delivered and executed as soon as the package is installed, without user interaction or consent. The code is also obfuscated with meaningless variable and class names, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling, and the package metadata is also obfuscated. All these factors, combined with the critical risk patterns described in the knowledge base, confirm this is malicious code.",
