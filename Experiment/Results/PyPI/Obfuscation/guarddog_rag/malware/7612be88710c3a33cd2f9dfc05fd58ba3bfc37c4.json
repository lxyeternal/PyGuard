      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (likely via setup.py). This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is strongly associated with malware. The use of subprocess.Popen to run a PowerShell command with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, especially with the window hidden, is a classic technique for delivering and executing obfuscated malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a critical indicator of malicious activity.",
