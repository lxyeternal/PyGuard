It then concatenates this data, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://129.226.195.123/v/...). This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, commonly seen in malicious Python packages, especially those targeting supply chain attacks via PyPI. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. The use of base64 encoding, hardcoded external IP, and the context of execution (setup script) are all strong indicators of malicious intent.",
