      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It collects sensitive system information (output of 'uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', and 'ifconfig'), which includes OS details, user identity, current directory, and network configuration. (2) It encodes this information using base64, a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. (3) It constructs a URL containing the encoded data and sends it to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (81.70.191.194:14333) using a shell-invoked 'curl' command, effectively exfiltrating the collected data. (4) This behavior is triggered automatically during the setup process (i.e., when the package is installed), without user consent, logging, or legitimate business justification. (5) The code uses obfuscated variable names and is embedded in a setup script, a common vector for supply chain attacks. All these patterns are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
