      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks and obfuscated malware in the Python ecosystem. Key points: (1) The functions dRJxZwZRsXzrVZmgmjObApRGmcGsZONr and hZrMCgUsMSmKdGEhaNYRCsJFDEdEZoHo both perform string manipulation and deobfuscation, then immediately pass the result to eval(), enabling arbitrary code execution. (2) The code is heavily obfuscated, with meaningless variable names and large blocks of unrelated assignments, a common technique to evade static analysis. (3) The code uses dynamic imports and indirect execution (e.g., __import__, getoutput, eval), which are classic evasion and payload delivery techniques. (4) The malicious payload is executed during the setup/install process (via setuptools), a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (5) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation to justify such dynamic code execution. (6) The code is structured to execute arbitrary, obfuscated code on the victim's machine during installation, which can lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware installation. (7) The patterns detected (decryption/decoding followed by eval, dynamic import and execution, obfuscation, and execution during install) are exclusively observed in malware samples and never in benign software.",
