      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious and exhibits multiple high-confidence indicators of malware, specifically a supply chain attack via a malicious setup.py. The function qEMVREipQeRzzySGWnWrMSDkRdENzjQJ establishes a reverse shell by connecting to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64:8080), redirects standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawns a shell (/bin/sh) using pty.spawn. This allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. The code is triggered automatically during package installation by overriding the setuptools install command (via cmdclass in setup), ensuring execution without user consent or awareness. The use of obfuscated function and class names, a suspicious external URL, and the absence of any legitimate business logic further confirm its malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem.",
