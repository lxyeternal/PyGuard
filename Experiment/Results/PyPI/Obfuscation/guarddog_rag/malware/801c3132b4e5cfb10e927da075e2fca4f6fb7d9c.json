      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the installation process (likely triggered by setup.py). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the payload. The PowerShell command appears to download and/or execute content from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (as indicated by the encoded string, which decodes to a command that uses Invoke-WebRequest to fetch from 'esqueleslt.000webhostapp.com/xEsquelesquad.exe' and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe', then executes it). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the code is triggered during package installation, downloads a remote executable, and runs it without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
