It defines a custom setuptools install command (KxrqlAfyHQuTOzsCTcqMBcCisgANekaf) that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python: the payload is hidden and obfuscated, only revealed and executed at install time, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during installation is strongly associated with malware and is never seen in benign packages. There is no legitimate reason for a package to execute hidden, decrypted code during installation, especially without user interaction or documentation.",
