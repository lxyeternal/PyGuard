      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior: (1) It downloads a list of filenames or commands from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://35.235.126.33/all.txt), which is not a trusted or official domain. (2) It then downloads additional files (likely executables) from the same remote server, saving them locally. (3) The code changes file permissions to make the downloaded files executable and then executes them using os.system, with different commands for Linux, macOS, and Windows. (4) There is no user interaction, consent, or notification, and no validation or integrity checking of the downloaded content. (5) The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, which is a common technique to evade detection. (6) The pattern of downloading and executing remote payloads is a hallmark of malware, especially in supply chain attacks or loader malware. (7) The code is embedded in wrapper functions that are likely to be called as part of seemingly benign HTTP request functions, further hiding its true intent. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
