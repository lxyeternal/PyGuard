      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload via subprocess.Popen during the setup process of a Python package. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern. The PowerShell command is obfuscated and encoded, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true behavior from static analysis and users. The command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a well-known technique for delivering malware. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. The code is triggered during package installation, which is a critical risk vector for supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
