      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, making its intent opaque and likely designed to evade detection. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks where code is executed during package installation (as seen here, embedded in a setup script). The code also uses non-standard, obfuscated argument names (e.g., 'UlbtHsiojROsKZHyjCSmHYCpvJwhIMft'), which is another hallmark of obfuscation and malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
