      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the installation/setup phase of a Python package. The command is obfuscated using PowerShell's -EncodedCommand flag, which is a common technique used by malware to hide its true intent and evade detection. The base64 payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is a classic example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the lack of user notification, the obfuscated payload, and the execution of a remote binary all strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware distributed via PyPI or similar channels.",
