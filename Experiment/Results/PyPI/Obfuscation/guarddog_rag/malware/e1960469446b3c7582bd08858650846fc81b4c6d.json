      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (in the setup.py context) if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a well-known obfuscation and payload delivery technique in malware. Decoding the base64 reveals that the command downloads and executes a remote executable from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it to a hidden location and running it. This enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent, and is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages and supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides the malicious activity. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
