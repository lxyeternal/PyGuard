The function WNvrhmWWGPScRBBlklPaINkgzQlfCihM collects sensitive system information, including system uptime, OS details, and network interface addresses, and then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) over TCP port 9090. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is embedded in the installation process of a Python package to steal information from unsuspecting users. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable and function names, lacks user notification or consent, and has no legitimate business logic for such data collection and exfiltration. The use of a custom install command to trigger this behavior during installation is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages.",
