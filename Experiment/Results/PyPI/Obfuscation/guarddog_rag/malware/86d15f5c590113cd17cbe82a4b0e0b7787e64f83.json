It then concatenates this information, base64-encodes it, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://129.226.195.123/v/...). This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, especially when embedded in a setup.py or installation script. The code lacks any user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this data transfer. The use of base64 encoding, suspicious hardcoded IP, and execution during package installation are all critical risk indicators. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to exfiltrate such information.",
