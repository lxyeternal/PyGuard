This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary—is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code lacks any legitimate business logic, user notification, or error handling, and the use of a Discord CDN link is a common tactic for malware distribution. There is no benign justification for this behavior in standard software, and this pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples.",
