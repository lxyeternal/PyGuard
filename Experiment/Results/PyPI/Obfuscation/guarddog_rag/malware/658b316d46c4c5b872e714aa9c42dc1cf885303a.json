This command downloads and immediately executes a shell script from a remote, hardcoded IP address using bash. This is a classic remote code execution pattern, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The use of a direct IP address, lack of user interaction, and execution during package setup (likely to be triggered during installation) are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This behavior is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages. The rest of the code is obfuscated and appears to be a standard setup.py template, likely to disguise the malicious payload.",
