      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command, once decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, particularly supply chain attacks via Python packages, as it enables arbitrary code execution and remote payload delivery during package installation. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
