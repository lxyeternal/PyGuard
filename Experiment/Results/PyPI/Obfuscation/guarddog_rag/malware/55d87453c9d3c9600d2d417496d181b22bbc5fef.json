      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly indicative of a supply chain attack and contains several critical risk patterns associated exclusively with malware. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (fxNyGgksvNYNgzLIlKzlyqneyYnEcnEJ) that executes code during package installation, a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages. (2) During installation, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' (the latter for cryptographic operations), and then immediately decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. (3) The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine at install time. (4) The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution is a classic malware obfuscation and delivery technique. (5) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. (6) The pattern of decrypting and executing code during installation is never observed in benign software and is a strong indicator of a supply chain attack, potentially enabling credential theft, data exfiltration, or remote code execution. (7) The package name and metadata are also obfuscated and non-descriptive, further supporting the malicious intent.",
