      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it downloads and executes a remote binary without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and is triggered during package installation (setup.py context), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. All these patterns are strongly associated with malicious Python packages and are never seen in benign software.",
