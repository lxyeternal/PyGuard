The command is run only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which are classic indicators of malware attempting to evade user detection. The encoded payload, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a location in the user's home directory and executing it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the malicious activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
