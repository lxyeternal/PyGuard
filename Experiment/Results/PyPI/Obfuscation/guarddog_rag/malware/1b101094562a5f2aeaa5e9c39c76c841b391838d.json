      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('Setup.exe') from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a Discord CDN link) and writes it to the local filesystem as 'download.exe'. It then immediately executes this file using os.startfile. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary without user interaction, validation, or consent—is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code lacks any error handling, user notification, or legitimate business logic, and the function and variable names are obfuscated, further indicating malicious intent. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it enables an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine.",
