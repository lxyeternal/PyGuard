It then serializes this information into a JSON object and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (http://us.dslab.pw/webhook.php) without any user notification or consent. The function responsible for this exfiltration (wWmwlUEZoVVZmDcOpGCengQBFfoRXDro) is obfuscated with a non-descriptive name, and the data exfiltration is triggered automatically upon script execution (ojYGeaSmJjiSgBXlgbDXwGcHVXZbPiDa() is called at the top level). This pattern matches known supply chain attack techniques, where malicious code is embedded in package setup scripts to steal user/system information during installation. The use of a non-corporate, suspicious domain, lack of user interaction, and the direct exfiltration of host-specific data are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior.",
