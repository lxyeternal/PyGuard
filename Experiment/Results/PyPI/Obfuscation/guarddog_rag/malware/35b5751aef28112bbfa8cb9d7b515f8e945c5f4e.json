      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious and exhibits multiple critical risk indicators associated with malware and supply chain attacks. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (UfIAoidejZpUYZQamoSOPtQxpEaUlkaS) that executes automatically during package installation. (2) During installation, it writes a Python script ('remote-access.py') containing a reverse shell payload to the user's home or Documents directory. (3) It then launches this script as a background process using subprocess.Popen. (4) The payload connects to a hardcoded external IP address (120.76.194.25) on port 20080, providing remote shell access to the attacker's server. (5) The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and suppresses exceptions to evade detection. (6) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for these actions. (7) The use of a custom install hook to execute arbitrary code is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python packages. (8) The code enables remote code execution, data exfiltration, and system compromise. All these behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software.",
