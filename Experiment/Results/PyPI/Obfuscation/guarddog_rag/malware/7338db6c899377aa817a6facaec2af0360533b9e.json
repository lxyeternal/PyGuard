The function GAtvsJYuyygKYQNnODNKrxmPMvIuWfhV establishes a reverse shell by connecting to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64:8080), redirects standard input/output/error to the socket, and spawns a shell (/bin/sh) using pty.spawn. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine. The code is triggered during package installation by overriding the setuptools install command (cmdclass={'install': ...}), ensuring the payload runs automatically when the package is installed. The use of obfuscated function and class names, lack of user interaction, and the presence of a suspicious external URL further confirm malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware, especially in supply chain attacks targeting Python package installations.",
