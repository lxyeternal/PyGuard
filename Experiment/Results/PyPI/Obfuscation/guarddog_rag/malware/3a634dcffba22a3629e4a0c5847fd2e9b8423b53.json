      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, a well-known obfuscation technique in malware. Decoding the base64 reveals that the command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and then running it. This enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the obfuscated payload, and the execution during setup (via distutils.core.setup) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package supply chain attacks.",
