      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (kexgqwWtFNOiyPJEXDwHndYMDxkvHMao) that registers a function (HCBWuhnGtoOLvxjOeseQsNmpnHxPUdgy) to be executed upon process exit, ensuring it runs during package installation. (2) The registered function collects sensitive host information: the external IP address (via requests.get('https://api.ipify.org')), the system hostname (os.uname()[1]), and the installation path. (3) This information is base64-encoded and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://kotko.org), with the data embedded in the query string. (4) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this exfiltration. (5) The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and is embedded in the install process, a classic supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign open-source packages.",
