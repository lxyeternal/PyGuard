The command is run only if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is obfuscated using the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation, with no user interaction or notification, and the payload is both obfuscated and fetched from an external source. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
