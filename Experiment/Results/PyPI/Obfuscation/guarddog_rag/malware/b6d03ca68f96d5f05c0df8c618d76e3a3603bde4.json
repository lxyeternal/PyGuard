      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command, once decoded, appears to download and execute a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'WindowsCache.exe' and then running it. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it downloads and executes a remote payload without user consent, uses obfuscation to evade detection, and is triggered during package installation (setup.py context), which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
