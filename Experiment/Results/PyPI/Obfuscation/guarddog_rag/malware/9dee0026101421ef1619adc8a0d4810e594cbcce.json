      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (likely via setup.py). This is a classic supply chain attack vector. The PowerShell command is obfuscated using the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a well-known technique for hiding malicious payloads. The code checks for the existence of a directory ('tahg'), and if it does not exist, it launches the PowerShell command in a hidden window. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The encoded PowerShell payload, when decoded, appears to download and execute a remote file or perform other potentially harmful actions. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
