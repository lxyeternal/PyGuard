      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a function (sRlYyZuDweeJdFedIhembDftOnGgJlAP) that constructs and executes a shell command via subprocess.run with shell=True. The command collects highly sensitive system information, including the hostname, current user (whoami), current working directory (pwd), directory listings (ls -la, ls ~), contents of /etc/passwd, installed NPM modules, and the user's bash history. This information is then exfiltrated via a POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://43.139.166.32:8080). The use of shell=True, the collection of sensitive data, and the exfiltration to an untrusted remote server are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. Furthermore, the code is embedded in a setup.py-like context, suggesting it could be executed during package installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The variable and function names are obfuscated, and there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, further supporting the assessment of malicious intent.",
