      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command (diRUgRkHsrYbJRMalxSNxRZPilKCMReb) that, when the package is installed, collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, and username. It then exfiltrates this data via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/). This behavior is executed automatically during package installation, without user consent or notification, and is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the lack of legitimate business logic, and the targeting of environment data for exfiltration further confirm the malicious intent. This pattern is not observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware in the Python ecosystem.",
