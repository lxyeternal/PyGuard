The command is obfuscated and is run only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a long base64 string is a hallmark of malware, as it hides the true intent of the command from static analysis. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a classic method for delivering and executing a secondary malicious payload. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malware delivery, especially in the context of Python package installation scripts.",
