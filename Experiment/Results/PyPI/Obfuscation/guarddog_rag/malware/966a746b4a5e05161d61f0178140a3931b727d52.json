      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process of a Python package. Specifically, if the 'tahg' path does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing malicious payloads. The base64-encoded command decodes to a PowerShell script that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is a hallmark of malware: it achieves remote code execution, payload delivery, and persistence, all without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. Embedding this logic in a setup script is a common supply chain attack vector, as it will execute automatically upon package installation.",
