      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system information (current working directory, username, hostname, directory listings, and the contents of /etc/passwd) by executing shell commands. It then encodes this data and exfiltrates it via an HTTP POST request to an external, non-corporate URL (http://pt.traktrain.com/req.php) without user consent or notification. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The combination of system reconnaissance, sensitive file access, and covert data exfiltration to a suspicious domain is a classic pattern of information-stealing malware. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying these actions.",
