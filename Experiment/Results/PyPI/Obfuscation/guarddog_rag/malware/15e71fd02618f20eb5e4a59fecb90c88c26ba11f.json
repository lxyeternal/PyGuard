      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during package installation (likely via setup.py). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a common technique in malware to hide its true intent. The base64 payload decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, often used in supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors, the check for a non-descriptive directory ('tahg'), and the lack of user notification or consent further indicate malicious intent. The code is designed to run automatically during installation, making it a high-severity supply chain threat.",
