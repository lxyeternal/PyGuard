      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, specifically credential (token) theft and exfiltration. The class rUjpLKzhtYTIdepWyNmjyfbuuqrgbKox is designed to search through a wide range of browser and Discord-related LevelDB directories in the user's AppData and LocalAppData folders, extracting Discord tokens using regular expressions. It then validates these tokens by making authenticated requests to the Discord API. If valid tokens are found, it exfiltrates them by sending them to a remote URL, which is itself fetched from another suspicious URL (https://rentry.co/23azs/raw), a common technique for hiding the true exfiltration endpoint and enabling dynamic C2 infrastructure. The code is heavily obfuscated, uses threading for stealth, and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality; all actions are geared toward stealthy data theft and exfiltration. The use of hardcoded, non-corporate URLs, targeting of sensitive directories, and automated exfiltration of credentials are all hallmarks of malware, specifically Discord token stealers.",
