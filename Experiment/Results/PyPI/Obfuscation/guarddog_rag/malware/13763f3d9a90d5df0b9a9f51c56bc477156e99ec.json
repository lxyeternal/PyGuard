It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.startfile. This pattern—downloading and executing a remote binary without user interaction, validation, or consent—is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The use of a direct IP address, lack of error handling, and absence of any legitimate business logic or user notification further reinforce the malicious nature of this code. Such behavior is never observed in benign software and is strongly associated with malware propagation, payload delivery, and potential system compromise.",
