      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (YrZEHkRuWwsyHFmSTTSUPNdVRLtlPmXE) that is executed automatically during package installation. Inside this command, it constructs a reverse shell payload that connects to a hardcoded external IP address (13.93.28.37) and port (1337), giving remote shell access to the attacker. The payload is base64-encoded to evade static detection, then decoded and executed via os.system('echo %s|base64 -d|bash' % ...), which is a classic obfuscation and execution pattern seen in malware. The use of a custom install hook, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded C2 address, and execution of a reverse shell during installation are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack and remote code execution. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages.",
