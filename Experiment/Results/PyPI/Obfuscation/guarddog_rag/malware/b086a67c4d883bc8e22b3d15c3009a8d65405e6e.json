This pattern is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution, as it enables remote code execution from an untrusted source without user consent or notification. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a try/except block to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection or prevent installation failures from alerting the user. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies downloading and executing a remote binary in this context.",
