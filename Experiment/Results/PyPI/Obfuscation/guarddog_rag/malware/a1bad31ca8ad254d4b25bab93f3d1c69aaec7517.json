      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware, specifically a Discord token stealer. It searches for Discord and browser tokens in the user's AppData and LocalAppData directories, extracts them using regular expressions, and exfiltrates the collected tokens to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1071628794491834449/Y29rga-lOVZ1NGdaC4UumNwV9jR34FFwJe4jMoi79hNwJMKJeBz8vSKAyecskkZK1kba). The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses all exceptions, and provides no user notification or consent. It targets sensitive directories, uses regular expressions to extract authentication tokens, and immediately sends them to an external server. These behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software. The use of a Discord webhook for exfiltration, targeting of browser and Discord directories, and lack of legitimate business logic or user-facing features further confirm its malicious intent.",
