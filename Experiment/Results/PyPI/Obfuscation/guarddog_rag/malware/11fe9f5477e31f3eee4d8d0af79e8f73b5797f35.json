The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a base64 string is a classic malware pattern for delivering and executing remote payloads or performing malicious actions without user consent. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This behavior is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, with no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. The presence of a suspicious, non-descriptive package name and the lack of documentation further support the malicious classification.",
