The function JoPoNsZuQfYCJoMAteyUYoXWGWEZvGBd collects sensitive system information, including OS details, platform, and the local IP address, and then exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64:9090) via a raw TCP socket. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where installation of a Python package results in covert data exfiltration without user consent. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable and class names, further indicating malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic, user notification, or documentation, and the behavior matches known malware patterns for information stealing and supply chain compromise.",
