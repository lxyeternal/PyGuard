      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (vuMdHysvPeeHfxUOzxYjOOdjxzyBlBhU) that is executed automatically during package installation. In the install hook, it collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, username, local and external IP addresses, and directory listings of root and home directories. It then encodes this information and exfiltrates it via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://425a2.rt11.ml) without user consent or notification. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names and suppresses exceptions to evade detection. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, and is never observed in benign software. The use of a custom install command to execute this logic during package installation is a critical risk indicator.",
