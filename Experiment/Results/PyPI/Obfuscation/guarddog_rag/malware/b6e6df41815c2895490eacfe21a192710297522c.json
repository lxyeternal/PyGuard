      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. 1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a classic system fingerprinting and data exfiltration technique. 2) It downloads a Windows executable (ini_file_pyp_41.exe) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and immediately executes it via os.system('start ...'), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. 3) All of this is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, meaning the malicious actions are triggered automatically during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks). 4) The code uses obfuscated variable names, suppresses all exceptions (hiding errors or detection), and provides no user notification or consent. 5) There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software, especially in the context of Python package installation scripts.",
