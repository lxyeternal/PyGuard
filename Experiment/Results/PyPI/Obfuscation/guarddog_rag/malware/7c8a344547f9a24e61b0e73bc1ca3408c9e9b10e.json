      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the installation/setup phase of a Python package. The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a long base64 string is a classic malware pattern for delivering and executing a secondary payload, often used to download and run additional malicious code or to establish persistence. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This behavior is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine without user consent, and is never observed in benign software.",
