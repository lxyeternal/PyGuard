      "malicious_behavior": "This code is a classic example of an information-stealing malware (specifically a Roblox cookie stealer). It programmatically extracts the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie from multiple browsers using browser_cookie3, which is a sensitive authentication token for Roblox accounts. It then collects additional user information (username, Robux balance, account age, friends, etc.) and the victim's public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org/). All of this data, including the stolen cookie, is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook (https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...), which is a common tactic for attackers to receive stolen credentials. The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and provides no user notification or consent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality; the sole purpose is credential theft and exfiltration. These behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators: credential theft, data exfiltration, use of hardcoded C2 infrastructure, browser data extraction, and lack of user consent.",
