      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during package installation (in the setup.py context). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a classic malware technique to evade detection. The decoded PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquelele.exe' and running it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the malicious activity. The code has no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the setup() call is only present to masquerade as a benign package.",
