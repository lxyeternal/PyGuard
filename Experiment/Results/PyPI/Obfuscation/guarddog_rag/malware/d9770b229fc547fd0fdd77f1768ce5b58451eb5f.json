It writes a Python script to a temporary file that, when executed, downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/9zyhb/raw) using exec(). This is a classic remote code execution pattern, enabling the attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The code then attempts to launch a new process using a modified Python executable name (replacing .exe with w.exe), passing the temporary file as an argument, which is a known evasion technique. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user interaction, and execution during package installation (via setup.py) are all hallmarks of supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed to execute arbitrary, untrusted code from the internet without user consent.",
