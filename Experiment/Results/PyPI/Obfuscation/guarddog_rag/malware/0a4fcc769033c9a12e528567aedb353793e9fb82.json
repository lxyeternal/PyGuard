It collects sensitive system and user information (hostname, username, current directory, OS details, file listings, and the contents of /etc/passwd on Unix-like systems) by executing shell commands via os.popen. The collected data is then URL-encoded and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external server (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response) without any user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of documentation, and the absence of any user-facing functionality further reinforce the malicious intent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to exfiltrate such sensitive information to an external server.",
