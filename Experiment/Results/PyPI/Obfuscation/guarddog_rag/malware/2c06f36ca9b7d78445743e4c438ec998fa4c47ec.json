      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks in the Python ecosystem. Specifically: (1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a hallmark of host fingerprinting and data exfiltration. (2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it via os.system('start ...'), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. (3) All of this is triggered automatically during package installation by hijacking the setuptools install command, a classic supply chain attack vector. (4) The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable and class names, and it suppresses all exceptions, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying these actions. The combination of data exfiltration, remote payload download and execution, and execution during install time is exclusively observed in malware samples and never in benign software.",
