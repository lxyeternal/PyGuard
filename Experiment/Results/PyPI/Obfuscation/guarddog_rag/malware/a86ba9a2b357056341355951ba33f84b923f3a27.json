      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It collects sensitive system information (package name, hostname, username, current working directory) and exfiltrates it to an external, suspicious domain (uchpuchmak.lol) via DNS queries. The exfiltration is performed covertly by encoding the data as hex, splitting it, and embedding it in DNS queries to a subdomain of the attacker's domain. Critically, this behavior is triggered automatically during package installation, development, or egg_info generation by hijacking setuptools' install, develop, and egg_info commands via the cmdclass argument in setup(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, enabling data theft from any system where the package is installed, without user consent or notification. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable and class names, and there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. All these characteristics match high-confidence indicators of Python malware, especially in the context of malicious PyPI packages.",
