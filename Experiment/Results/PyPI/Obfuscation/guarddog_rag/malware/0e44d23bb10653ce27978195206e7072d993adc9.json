      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (jwRVSVZiuKpMRYIhGCVKjJTLGavukdZb) that is executed automatically during package installation. The function sfvECQfFOzINIUxceqhyIrGARaZukMEs collects sensitive system information, including system uptime, OS details, platform, and the local IP address. It then establishes a raw socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 80 and sends the collected information without user consent or notification. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where malicious code is executed during installation to exfiltrate host information to an attacker-controlled server. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, lack of user interaction, and the embedding of this logic in the install hook are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
