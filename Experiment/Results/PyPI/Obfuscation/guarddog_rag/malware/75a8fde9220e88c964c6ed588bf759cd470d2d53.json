      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern. In the setup script, before the legitimate setup() call, it checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist. If so, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The base64-encoded PowerShell command is likely to download and execute further malicious code or perform other harmful actions, such as data exfiltration, persistence, or remote code execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors, the lack of user notification, the obfuscated command, and the execution during package installation (setup.py) are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package supply chain attacks.",
