      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed on the victim's machine without user consent or visibility. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the behavior. The base64-encoded PowerShell command appears to download and/or execute a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will run automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
