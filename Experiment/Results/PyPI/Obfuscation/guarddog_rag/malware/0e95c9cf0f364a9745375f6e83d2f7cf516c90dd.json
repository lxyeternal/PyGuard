      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during package installation (via setup.py). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a classic malware technique to hide its true intent. The PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquelele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a textbook supply chain attack vector, as it runs automatically when the package is installed, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. The code has no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and all observed behaviors (obfuscated payload delivery, hidden execution, remote download, lack of user interaction, and error suppression) are strongly associated with malware and never seen in benign software.",
