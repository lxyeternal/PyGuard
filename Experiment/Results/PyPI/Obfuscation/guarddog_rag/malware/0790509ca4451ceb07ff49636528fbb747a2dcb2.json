      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines custom setuptools install and develop commands that, when triggered during package installation (e.g., via pip install), will automatically download a Windows executable (Cleaner.exe) from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://a4a08d21-3950-435e-8b39-12ab7788cd10.id.repl.co/Cleaner.exe) and execute it on the victim's machine using os.system. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern, where arbitrary code is executed during package installation without user consent or notification. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names, and there is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. The use of a remote, non-corporate domain, lack of integrity checks, and immediate execution of a downloaded binary are all strong indicators of malware. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python package malware.",
