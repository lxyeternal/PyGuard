      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded, making its intent difficult to determine at a glance, but this pattern is strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks where code is executed during package installation (as seen here, embedded in a setup.py script). The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides malicious activity. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute a hidden, obfuscated PowerShell command, especially one that appears to download or execute remote content. This matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated code execution, use of encoded PowerShell, hidden process creation, and execution during installation.",
