      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple critical indicators of malicious behavior, consistent with known supply chain attacks and malware delivery patterns in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It downloads files from hardcoded, suspicious IP addresses (http://52.14.229.35:1122/connect-CANDC.txt and http://52.14.229.35:1122/shoomsha.jpg), which are not associated with any legitimate software distribution. (2) The downloaded files are saved locally and then immediately executed as batch files via subprocess.Popen with shell=True, enabling arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source. (3) The code attempts to install the 'requests' library if missing, ensuring its own network capabilities. (4) It uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions, both common evasion techniques. (5) The malicious logic is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (6) There is no user notification, consent, or validation of the downloaded content before execution. (7) The code attempts to clean up after itself by deleting the batch files, further hiding its tracks. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign Python packages.",
