      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (via setup.py). Specifically, it checks for the absence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if not present, it runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a hidden or user-specific location and executing it. This enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user consent. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in supply chain attacks via PyPI or similar ecosystems.",
