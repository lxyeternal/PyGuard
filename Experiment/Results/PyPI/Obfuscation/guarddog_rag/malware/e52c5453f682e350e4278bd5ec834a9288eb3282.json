      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains two instances of dynamically decoding and executing base64-encoded payloads using __import__('builtins').exec(__import__('builtins').compile(...)). The decoded payload, when base64-decoded, reveals the following actions: (1) it imports modules for temporary file creation, system command execution, and file system operations; (2) it writes a Python script to a temporary file, which downloads and executes code from a hardcoded external IP address (http://137.117.157.128/inject/7bUCnM4pqa3ZkGit) using urllib; (3) it attempts to execute the downloaded code, replacing '.exe' with '.w.exe' in the filename, and suppresses all exceptions. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: dynamic code execution during installation (supply chain attack vector), obfuscation via base64 encoding, use of indirect imports and exec, hardcoded external IP address (potential C2 server), and lack of user notification or consent. The code is designed to execute arbitrary remote code on the victim's machine, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks.",
