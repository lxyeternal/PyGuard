      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: (1) It uses heavy obfuscation, including lambda functions, indirect variable names, and multi-layered encoding/decoding (base64, zlib, codecs). (2) It dynamically reconstructs and executes code using eval and exec, including code that is decoded and decompressed at runtime, which is a classic malware technique for hiding payloads and evading static analysis. (3) The code includes a large, obfuscated payload (the long base64/zlib string) that is decoded and executed, the contents of which are not visible without further deobfuscation, but this pattern is strongly associated with malware delivery. (4) The code manipulates __builtins__ to potentially override or inject malicious behavior into the Python runtime. (5) There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation; all code is focused on obfuscation and dynamic execution. (6) The use of random, misleading variable names and the absence of any user-facing features further indicate intent to hide malicious actions. (7) The code is structured to execute its payload immediately upon import or execution, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious PyPI packages. (8) The code matches multiple critical risk patterns from the knowledge base, including multi-stage decoding and execution, dynamic manipulation of builtins, and lack of any benign context.",
