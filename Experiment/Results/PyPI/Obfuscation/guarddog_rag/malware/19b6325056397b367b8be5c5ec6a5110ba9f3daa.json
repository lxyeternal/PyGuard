      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (in the setup.py context). The command is run only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion and persistence technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated via base64 encoding and is executed with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' flag, which hides the process window from the user. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, often used in supply chain attacks via malicious PyPI packages. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection and ensure execution. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute remote binaries in this manner.",
