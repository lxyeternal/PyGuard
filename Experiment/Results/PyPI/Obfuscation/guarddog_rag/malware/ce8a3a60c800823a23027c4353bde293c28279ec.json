      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads three executable files from a local HTTP server (http://127.0.0.1:5000/listener_exe, /payload_exe, /Rshell_exe) and writes them to the Windows Temp directory. It then immediately executes one of these executables (Alistener.exe) using subprocess.Popen. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware: (1) downloading and writing executables to disk from a remote source, (2) executing a downloaded binary without user interaction or validation, (3) embedding this logic in a setuptools install hook so it runs automatically during package installation (a hallmark of supply chain attacks), (4) use of obfuscated function and variable names, and (5) lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality. Even though the URLs are localhost, this is a common technique in malware to stage payloads or evade detection during analysis. There is no error handling, user notification, or legitimate reason for this behavior in a setup script. The code is highly likely to be malicious.",
