      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple, critical indicators of malicious behavior. 1) It collects the victim's COMPUTERNAME environment variable and exfiltrates it to a suspicious, non-corporate domain (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php), which is a hallmark of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. 2) It downloads a Windows executable (python-install.scr) from another suspicious domain (https://python-release.com), writes it to disk as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe', and immediately executes it using os.system('start ...'), enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. 3) All of this logic is embedded in a custom setuptools install command, ensuring it runs automatically during package installation (a classic supply chain attack vector). 4) The code uses obfuscated variable names, suppresses all exceptions (hiding errors or detection), and provides no user notification or consent. 5) There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality present. These behaviors are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never found in benign software, especially in the context of Python package installation scripts.",
