      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (InstallCommand) that, during package installation, reconstructs and executes an obfuscated payload. The payload is stored as a long, non-descriptive string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) and is XOR-decrypted using another string (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). The decrypted result is then executed as Python code via eval(compile(..., 'exec')), which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks, as it allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides any failures or detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior. This pattern is observed exclusively in malware samples and is never seen in benign software.",
