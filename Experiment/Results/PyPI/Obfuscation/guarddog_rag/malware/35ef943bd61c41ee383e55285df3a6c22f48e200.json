This allows an attacker to gain remote shell access to the victim's machine, enabling arbitrary command execution, data exfiltration, and system compromise. The function is executed at the module level, and the code is embedded in a setup.py-like file, indicating a supply chain attack vector (malicious PyPI package). There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic for this behavior. The use of a hardcoded IP, direct shell invocation, and execution during installation are all strong indicators of malware, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor.",
