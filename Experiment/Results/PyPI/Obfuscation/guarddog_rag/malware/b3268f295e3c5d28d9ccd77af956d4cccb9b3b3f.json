      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (via setup.py). Specifically, it checks if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, and if so, it runs a base64-encoded PowerShell command with '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand', which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and executing malicious payloads on Windows systems. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a location in the user's home directory and executing it. This behavior is highly indicative of malware: it achieves remote code execution, payload delivery, and evasion (by hiding the window and encoding the command). The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides its activity. This pattern is never seen in benign software and is a hallmark of malicious PyPI packages and supply chain attacks.",
