      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, is likely to download and execute a remote payload or perform other malicious actions. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks, as it is embedded in a setup script and will execute during package installation, potentially compromising the system without user consent. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute an obfuscated PowerShell command in this manner.",
