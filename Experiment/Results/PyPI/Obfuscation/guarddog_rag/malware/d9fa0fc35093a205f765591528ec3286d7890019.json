      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system and user information, including the current username, hostname, external IP address, Python version, and timestamp. It then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://123.206.22.33:5000/p/) without user consent or notification. This is a classic data exfiltration pattern, strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, especially when embedded in a setup or installation script. The use of a temporary file to avoid repeated execution, the lack of user-facing functionality, and the suppression of exceptions further indicate an attempt to evade detection and ensure persistence. The code is executed automatically upon import or installation, which is a hallmark of malicious packages targeting the Python ecosystem.",
