      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without revealing its intent in the source code. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures and prevents detection. The PowerShell command, once decoded, appears to download and execute a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a hallmark of malware delivery and remote code execution. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will run automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
