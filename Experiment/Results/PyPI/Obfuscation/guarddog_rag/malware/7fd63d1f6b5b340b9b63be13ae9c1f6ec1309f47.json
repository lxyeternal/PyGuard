      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly suspicious and dangerous pattern: it decodes a base64-encoded payload and immediately executes it using exec and compile, all via indirect calls through __import__('builtins'). This is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique. The decoded payload, when examined, performs the following actions: (1) downloads and executes code from a remote server (http://137.117.157.128/inject/Uxczzo8EBZA3lBcDs), (2) writes the downloaded content to a temporary file, (3) executes the file, and (4) suppresses exceptions to evade detection. This is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware, especially as it is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, meaning it will run automatically during package installation. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate IP address, lack of user interaction, obfuscation, and immediate execution of remote code are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality that justifies this behavior.",
