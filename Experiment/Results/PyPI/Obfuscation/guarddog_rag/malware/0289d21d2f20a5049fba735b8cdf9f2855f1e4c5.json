      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads, as it allows arbitrary PowerShell code to be executed without revealing its intent in the source code. The command is only executed if a file or directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides failures or detection. The encoded PowerShell command appears to download and/or execute content from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a well-known vector for malware delivery. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. All these behaviors—obfuscated command execution, hidden process window, external payload download, and execution during installation—are strongly associated with malware and are never seen in benign software.",
