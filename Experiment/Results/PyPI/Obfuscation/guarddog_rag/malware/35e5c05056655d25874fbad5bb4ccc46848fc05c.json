      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious commands on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion technique to avoid repeated execution. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides its activity. The base64-encoded PowerShell command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack: the code is embedded in a setup script, so it will execute automatically during package installation, potentially compromising the system without user knowledge or consent. All these behaviors—obfuscated payload delivery, remote code execution, error suppression, and execution during installation—are strong indicators of malware.",
