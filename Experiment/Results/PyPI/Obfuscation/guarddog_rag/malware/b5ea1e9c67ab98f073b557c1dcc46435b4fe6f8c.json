      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including: (1) Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, making analysis and intent determination difficult. (2) Use of dynamic code execution via exec, eval, and compile, including indirect and obfuscated invocation (e.g., through lambdas and globals). (3) Presence of compressed (zlib) and binary payloads that are passed to functions with names and patterns typical of malware (e.g., decompressing and executing code at runtime). (4) Use of indirect imports (__import__) and dynamic evaluation of code, which is a classic evasion and payload delivery technique. (5) The code contains suspicious, non-descriptive, and obfuscated class and function names, and uses try/except blocks to suppress errors, which is a common anti-analysis and evasion tactic. (6) The code includes hardcoded, obfuscated byte strings that are likely to be additional payloads or configuration data, and these are processed and potentially executed at runtime. (7) The code structure and patterns (e.g., decompressing and executing code, dynamic imports, indirect eval/exec, and obfuscated logic) are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never found in benign software. (8) The code is not performing any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and its only purpose appears to be the dynamic execution of hidden payloads. (9) The code is associated with the 'Hyperion' malware family, which is known for supply chain attacks and malicious payload delivery. (10) The code is designed to execute during module import or installation, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. All of these factors, especially in combination, are strong and reliable indicators of malicious intent.",
