      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (in the setup.py context) if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and passed to the '-EncodedCommand' argument, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The decoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a location in the user's home directory and executing it. This enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides malicious activity. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in supply chain attacks via PyPI or similar ecosystems.",
