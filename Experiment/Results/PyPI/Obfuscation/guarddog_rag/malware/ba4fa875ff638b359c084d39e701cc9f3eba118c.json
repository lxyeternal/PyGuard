      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquele.exe' and 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs them. This behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it enables remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential persistence or further compromise. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
