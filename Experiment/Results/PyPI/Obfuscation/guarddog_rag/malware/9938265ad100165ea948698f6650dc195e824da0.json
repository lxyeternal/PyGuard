      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (VKVdvsUvvTkimgtsezdoouLWGgkpzNVS) that is executed automatically during package installation. In the install hook, it collects sensitive system information: the package name, hostname, current username, and current working directory. This information is serialized to JSON, hex-encoded, and then split into chunks. For each chunk, the code constructs a DNS query string that includes the chunked data and attempts to resolve it via socket.getaddrinfo to a hardcoded, suspicious domain (krfdjo3y14gnxlmuyzp4gb7ufllc92xr.oastify.com). This is a classic data exfiltration technique using DNS queries to leak information to an attacker-controlled server. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable names and is embedded in the installation process, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate reason for a setup.py to exfiltrate environment data to an external domain during installation.",
