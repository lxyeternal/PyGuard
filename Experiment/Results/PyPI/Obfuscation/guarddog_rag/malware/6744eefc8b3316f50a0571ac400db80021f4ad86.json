It targets the user's Telegram Desktop data directory (specifically the 'tdata' folder in APPDATA), collects files and directories matching patterns associated with Telegram session and key files, compresses them into a zip archive in memory, and then exfiltrates this archive to an external server via a hardcoded Telegram bot API endpoint. This is a classic information-stealing pattern, specifically targeting Telegram session data, which can be used to hijack the victim's Telegram account. The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically upon package installation (supply chain attack vector). There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for this behavior. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection.",
