It downloads a ZIP file from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://frvezdffvvvv.pythonanywhere.com/getpip), extracts its contents to the user's APPDATA directory, deletes the ZIP to cover its tracks, and then executes a .bat file (5_3.bat) from the same location using subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to hide the process window. This sequence is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via Python packages. The code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, meaning it will execute during package installation, further increasing the risk. There is no user notification, validation, or legitimate business logic for these actions. The use of obfuscated variable names and the lack of error handling or documentation further support the assessment that this is malicious code.",
