It then encodes this data and exfiltrates it via an HTTP POST request to an external, suspicious domain (packageman.comlu.com) without user consent or notification. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation (a classic supply chain attack vector). The use of a try/except block to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and is never observed in benign software.",
