The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a long base64 string is a hallmark of malware, as it hides the true intent of the command from static analysis. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote payload from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), which is a classic malware delivery and remote code execution technique. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This pattern is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and is never observed in benign software. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to execute hidden, obfuscated PowerShell commands that download and run remote executables.",
