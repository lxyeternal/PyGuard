The command is obfuscated and is executed only if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The use of '-EncodedCommand' with a base64 string is a classic malware pattern for delivering and executing remote payloads or performing malicious actions without user consent. The code is wrapped in a try/except block to suppress errors and avoid detection. This behavior is strongly associated with supply chain attacks and malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, with no legitimate business logic or user-facing purpose.",
