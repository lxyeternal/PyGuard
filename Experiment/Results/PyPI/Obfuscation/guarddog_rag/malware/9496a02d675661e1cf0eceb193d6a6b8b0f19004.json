      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system and user information, including the current username, hostname, platform details, and local IP address. It then encodes this information using base64 and exfiltrates it to an external, hardcoded, suspicious domain (http://mysql.openvc.org/mysql.php) without user consent or notification. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and is executed automatically during package installation (via setup.py), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of os.popen to execute shell commands and the lack of any legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality further confirm its malicious intent. These patterns are exclusively observed in malware samples and are never present in benign software.",
