      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a long base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and executing potentially malicious commands on Windows systems. The command is only executed if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The base64 payload, when decoded, reveals a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk patterns associated exclusively with malware, including: (1) execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands, (2) downloading and executing remote payloads, (3) use of hidden process windows to evade user detection, (4) execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector), and (5) suppression of all exceptions to hide errors or detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
