      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command that, when triggered during package installation, constructs a reverse shell command targeting a hardcoded external host (e6j4342057.zicp.fun) and port (26264). The command is base64-encoded and then executed via os.system('echo %s|base64 -d|bash' % ...), which decodes and runs the payload in a bash shell. This enables arbitrary remote code execution on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding, and execution during installation are classic hallmarks of supply chain attacks and Python malware. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality, and the code is designed solely to compromise the system.",
