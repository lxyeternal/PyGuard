      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive system and user information, including the current username, hostname, platform details, and local IP address. It then encodes this data using base64 and exfiltrates it to an external, hardcoded, non-corporate domain (http://openvc.org/Version.php) without user consent or notification. The exfiltration occurs automatically during package installation or initialization, as the data collection and transmission function is called before the setup() function. The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable names and lacks any legitimate business logic or user-facing features. The use of os.popen to execute shell commands and capture environment variables further increases the risk, as this is a common technique for environment reconnaissance in malware. The combination of these behaviors—automatic execution during install, data exfiltration, obfuscation, and use of suspicious network destinations—matches patterns observed exclusively in malware, particularly supply chain attacks targeting Python package ecosystems.",
