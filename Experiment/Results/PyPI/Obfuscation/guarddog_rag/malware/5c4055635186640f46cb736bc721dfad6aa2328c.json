It defines a custom setuptools install command (mxnADBfMzUeBBwkZDuzHNYskFGjZErgb) that, during package installation, imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and immediately executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks in Python, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the target system during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality present, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a hidden payload. This matches multiple critical risk indicators from the knowledge base, including: execution of decrypted code at install time, use of hardcoded cryptographic keys, obfuscation, and supply chain attack vector.",
