      "malicious_behavior": "This code is clearly malicious and demonstrates several critical risk indicators associated with supply chain attacks and remote access trojans (RATs). Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (RzNfmxJtHuShJAnggmHgnJhHHEWueOaE) that, when triggered during package installation (e.g., via pip install), executes the function YVdYMdxwKDKuQDILgqFJIPBDwtQlRJun. (2) This function creates a reverse shell by connecting to a hardcoded external IP address (194.233.164.169) and port (1337), then redirects the process's stdin, stdout, and stderr to this socket, and spawns a shell ('sh') using pty.spawn. This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the user running the install. (3) The code is obfuscated with non-descriptive variable and class names, and the package metadata (e.g., author: 'Malicious Actor') further indicates malicious intent. (4) The malicious payload is executed automatically during installation, without user consent or notification, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (5) There is no legitimate business logic, user-facing functionality, or documentation to justify this behavior. All these factors, combined with the use of a suspicious package name and the presence of classic RAT techniques, confirm this is a high-confidence malicious sample.",
