It downloads a binary file ('node') from a suspicious, non-official URL ('https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node') to the /tmp directory, writes it as an executable, and then immediately executes it using a shell command ('cd /tmp && chmod +x node && ./node'). This pattern is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The function is invoked at import time, which means it will execute as soon as the package is installed or imported, a common technique in supply chain attacks. The code also suppresses all exceptions, potentially hiding errors or detection. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. The use of obfuscated function and variable names further suggests an attempt to evade detection. All these factors, especially the download and execution of a remote binary during installation, are critical risk indicators and are never observed in benign software.",
