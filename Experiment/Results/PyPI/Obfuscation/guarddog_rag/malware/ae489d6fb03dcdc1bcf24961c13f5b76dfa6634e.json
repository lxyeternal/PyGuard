      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a classic supply chain attack pattern: it executes a hidden PowerShell command during package installation (in the setup.py context) if a certain file ('tahg') does not exist. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and executed with the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a well-known technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads. The encoded command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), writing it to a location in the user's home directory and executing it. This enables arbitrary code execution, remote payload delivery, and potential system compromise without user consent or notification. The use of try/except to suppress errors further hides malicious activity. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, and are never seen in benign Python packages.",
