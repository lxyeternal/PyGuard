It defines a custom setuptools install command (QKSSxLDXlMSAOixBEiZbGjeXrnqTzgGx) that, during package installation on Windows systems, dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses Fernet decryption with a hardcoded key to decrypt an encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is immediately executed via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and is used to deliver and execute arbitrary, hidden code on the victim's machine during installation, without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, encrypted payloads, and dynamic code execution during install time are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality present, and the code is designed to evade static analysis and deliver a secondary, hidden payload.",
