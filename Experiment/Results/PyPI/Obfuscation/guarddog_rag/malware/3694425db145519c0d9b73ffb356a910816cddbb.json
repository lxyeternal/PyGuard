      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It hijacks the setuptools install process by defining a custom install command (JTaBvXqoPyuGKZbUutFNJpVzlhzlqmKC) and registering it in the setup() call. During installation, it collects sensitive system information including the hostname, current working directory, username, local and external IP addresses, and directory listings of root and home directories. It then exfiltrates this data to an external, suspicious domain (https://425a2.rt11.ml) via an HTTP POST request. The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses exceptions to evade detection, and provides no user notification or consent. This pattern is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware, and is never observed in benign software.",
