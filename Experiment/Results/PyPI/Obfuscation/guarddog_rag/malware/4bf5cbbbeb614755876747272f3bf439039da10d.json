      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-EncodedCommand' flag and a base64-encoded payload. This is a classic technique for obfuscating and delivering malicious payloads on Windows systems. The base64 string decodes to a PowerShell command that downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/...), saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, and then runs it. This behavior is triggered during package installation (setup.py), which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote binary in this manner, and this pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples.",
