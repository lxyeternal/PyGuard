      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It hijacks the setuptools installation process by defining custom install, develop, and egg_info commands that execute the function xWWGiezhEnmPkZNqfGZWLdcYXcddcOas() during package installation or development. This function collects sensitive system information, including the current username, hostname, and working directory, encodes it, and exfiltrates it via DNS queries to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (for-research.ru). The use of obfuscated variable and class names, lack of user notification or consent, and the embedding of this behavior in the installation process are all hallmarks of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The code matches multiple critical risk indicators: exfiltration of host/user data, execution during install, obfuscation, and use of a suspicious domain.",
