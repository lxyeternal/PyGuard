      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a critical malicious pattern: it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it executes a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen. The PowerShell command is base64-encoded and uses the '-EncodedCommand' flag, which is a classic obfuscation technique to hide the true intent of the command. Decoding the base64 payload reveals that it downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'Esquele.exe' in the user's home directory, then executes it. This is a textbook example of a supply chain attack, where arbitrary code is executed during package installation (setup.py), enabling remote code execution, potential data exfiltration, and system compromise. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. All these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are never observed in benign software.",
