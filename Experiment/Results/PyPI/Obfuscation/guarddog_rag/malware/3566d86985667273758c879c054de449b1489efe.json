      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the setup process of a Python package. Specifically, it checks for the existence of a file or directory named 'tahg', and if it does not exist, it runs a PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. The encoded command, when decoded, downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com) and saves it as 'WindowsCache.exe' in the user's home directory, then invokes it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, commonly used in supply chain attacks via malicious PyPI packages. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hidden execution, lack of user interaction or notification, and execution during package installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code also suppresses all exceptions, further hiding its behavior.",
