If successful, it exfiltrates the retrieved token to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log) via an HTTP POST request. This pattern matches classic credential theft and exfiltration behavior seen in cloud-targeted malware. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user interaction or consent, and the targeting of sensitive cloud metadata endpoints further confirm malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
