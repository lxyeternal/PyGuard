      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell command using a base64-encoded payload during the installation process (likely via setup.py). The command is run only if a specific file ('tahg') does not exist, which is a common evasion technique. The PowerShell command is obfuscated using the -EncodedCommand flag, which is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The base64 string decodes to a command that downloads and executes a file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saves it as 'Esquele.exe', and then runs it. This is a classic pattern for remote code execution and payload delivery, often used in supply chain attacks via malicious Python packages. The use of try/except to suppress errors further indicates an attempt to evade detection. There is no legitimate business logic or user-facing functionality to justify this behavior.",
