During installation, it executes a shell command via os.system that downloads and executes a remote script from http://34.69.215.243/hi using curl and bash, with all output suppressed. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: arbitrary code is fetched and executed on the victim's machine during package installation, without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded, non-corporate IP address, lack of error handling, and obfuscated class/function names further indicate malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks.",
