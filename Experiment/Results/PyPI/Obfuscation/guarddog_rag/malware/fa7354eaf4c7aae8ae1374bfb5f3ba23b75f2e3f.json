      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines custom setuptools install and develop command classes that override the standard installation process. During both 'develop' and 'install' commands, the code makes HTTP GET requests to the hardcoded, suspicious domain 'http://poiqwe.info' (with different endpoints for pre/post install and develop). This network communication is performed automatically and silently during package installation, without user consent, logging, or legitimate business justification. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the lack of documentation, and the targeting of a non-corporate, suspicious domain are all strong indicators of a supply chain attack. This pattern is a hallmark of Python malware, especially in malicious PyPI packages, and is never observed in benign software. The code could be used for system fingerprinting, tracking installations, or as a C2 beacon. The presence of this pattern in the setup script is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malicious intent.",
