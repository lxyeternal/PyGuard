Specifically: (1) It sends a notification to a hardcoded Discord webhook upon installation, which is a classic exfiltration technique used by malware to notify an attacker of a new victim. (2) It clones a suspicious GitHub repository ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') into a user directory, which is a common method for staging additional payloads. (3) It immediately executes a Python script ('bypass.py') from the cloned repository using subprocess.run, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. (4) The code is embedded in a setup script, meaning it will execute automatically during package installation, a hallmark of supply chain attacks. (5) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate business logic for these actions. (6) The use of obfuscated variable names and lack of documentation further indicate an attempt to evade detection. All of these behaviors are strongly associated with malware and are not found in benign software.",
