      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python script to a temporary file that, when executed, downloads and executes code from a remote URL (https://rentry.co/ki74h/raw) using urllib.request.urlopen and exec. This is a classic remote code execution pattern, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine without their knowledge or consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of user interaction, suppression of exceptions, and execution of code fetched from an untrusted external source are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never seen in benign software, as it enables attackers to deliver and execute secondary payloads, steal data, or compromise the system.",
