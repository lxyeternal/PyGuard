      "malicious_behavior": "This code is highly likely to be malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (VYtzCGIMVgFuGggKDzMaudasgSffnQwm) that, during package installation, checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'). If so, it dynamically imports 'requests' and 'fernet', then uses Fernet with a hardcoded key to decrypt an encrypted payload and immediately executes the result with exec(). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the decrypted code is hidden and only revealed at install time, making static analysis difficult. The use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, and execution of decrypted code during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate business logic, user interaction, or documentation justifying this behavior. The code is designed to execute arbitrary, hidden code on the victim's machine during installation, which is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks.",
