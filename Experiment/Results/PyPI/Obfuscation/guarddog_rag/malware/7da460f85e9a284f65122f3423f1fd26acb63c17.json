      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a hidden PowerShell process with a base64-encoded command during the setup phase of a Python package (likely during installation). The command is obfuscated and uses '-EncodedCommand', a common technique in malware to hide the true intent of the payload. The PowerShell command downloads and executes a remote file from a suspicious, non-corporate domain (dl.dropbox.com), saving it as 'Esquelele.exe' and then running it. This is a classic malware delivery and execution pattern, often used in supply chain attacks via malicious PyPI packages. The use of try/except to suppress all errors further hides the malicious activity. There is no legitimate reason for a setup script to download and execute a remote executable in this manner, especially with obfuscation and without user consent.",
