      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, specifically credential theft and exfiltration. The code searches for Discord tokens in browser and Discord client local storage directories by traversing sensitive paths in the user's AppData and LocalAppData folders. It uses regular expressions to extract Discord tokens from LevelDB files, then validates these tokens by making authenticated requests to the Discord API. If valid tokens are found, it exfiltrates them by sending them to a remote URL, which is itself fetched from another suspicious remote location (https://rentry.co/23azs/raw, a pastebin-like service often used by malware authors to hide C2 endpoints). The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and uses threading to run its malicious logic in the background. There is no legitimate user-facing functionality or business logic, and the code is designed to run automatically and stealthily. All these behaviors are hallmarks of information-stealing malware.",
