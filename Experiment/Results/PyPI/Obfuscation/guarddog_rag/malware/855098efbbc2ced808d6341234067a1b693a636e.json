      "malicious_behavior": "This code is malicious. It defines a custom setuptools install command (PostInstallCommand) that is automatically executed during package installation. In the run() method, it calls the app() function, which, if running on Windows, downloads an executable (DigitalPulse.exe) from a suspicious, non-corporate URL (https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe) and immediately executes it using os.system('start ' + filename). This is a classic supply chain attack pattern: the package, when installed (e.g., via pip), will automatically fetch and run a remote binary without user consent, potentially compromising the system. The use of a non-descriptive package name, lack of user notification, and execution of a remote payload during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is never observed in benign software and is a hallmark of Python malware and supply chain attacks.",
