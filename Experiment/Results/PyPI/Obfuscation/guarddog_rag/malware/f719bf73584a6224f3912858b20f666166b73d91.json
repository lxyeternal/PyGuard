      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior, including: (1) Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, making analysis and intent determination difficult. (2) Use of dynamic code execution via eval, exec, and compile, including indirect and obfuscated invocation (e.g., eval(compile(str(...)), ...)). (3) Use of lambda functions and indirect references to further obscure the execution chain. (4) Presence of what appears to be compressed or encoded payloads (e.g., long byte strings passed as arguments), which are likely decompressed and executed at runtime. (5) Dynamic import of modules using __import__ and manipulation of globals, a common evasion and payload delivery technique. (6) The code executes arbitrary code during the main block, with no user interaction or legitimate business logic, and appears to be designed to run hidden or secondary payloads. (7) The code includes suspicious hardcoded URLs and references to Discord and GitHub, which may be used for C2 or exfiltration. (8) The code structure and patterns (multi-layered decoding, dynamic execution, obfuscated control flow) are strongly associated with malware, especially in supply chain attacks and loader/backdoor scenarios. (9) The flagged line (and surrounding code) is part of a sequence that decodes and executes further obfuscated code, a hallmark of malware delivery. (10) There is no legitimate user-facing functionality, documentation, or error handling, and the code is designed to evade detection and analysis.",
