      "malicious_behavior": "This code defines a custom setuptools install command that, during package installation, collects sensitive system information (hostname, current working directory, and username) and exfiltrates it to an external, non-corporate URL (https://eol6mx6at717hhs.m.pipedream.net/generaldelta) via an HTTP GET request. This is done without user consent, logging, or any legitimate business logic. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, the embedding of this logic in the install hook (a hallmark of supply chain attacks), and the targeting of a suspicious remote endpoint are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is exclusively observed in malware samples and is never seen in benign software, especially in the context of package installation.",
