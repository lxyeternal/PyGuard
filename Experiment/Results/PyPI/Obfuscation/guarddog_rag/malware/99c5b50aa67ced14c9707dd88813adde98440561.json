      "malicious_behavior": "This code exhibits multiple hallmarks of malicious behavior, particularly those associated with supply chain attacks in Python packages. Specifically: (1) It defines a custom setuptools install command (pTcStviUlVBoFyJBWLYcrlUBnrlAQWiz) that executes during package installation, a common vector for supply chain attacks. (2) It uses base64 decoding to obfuscate a shell command ('ioreg -k IOPlatformUUID'), which is then executed via subprocess.check_output to extract the system's hardware UUID, a classic system fingerprinting technique. (3) It checks if the UUID matches a hardcoded list, likely to target specific systems or evade sandboxes. (4) If matched, it reads a local PDF file, extracts a portion of its binary content, writes it as an executable ('gomod') to a suspicious temporary directory, sets executable permissions, and then executes it via subprocess.Popen with all output suppressed. This is a classic pattern for staging and running a secondary, likely malicious payload. (5) All of this is done without user interaction, notification, or legitimate business logic, and is heavily obfuscated. These behaviors are strongly associated with malware, especially in the context of Python package supply chain attacks.",
