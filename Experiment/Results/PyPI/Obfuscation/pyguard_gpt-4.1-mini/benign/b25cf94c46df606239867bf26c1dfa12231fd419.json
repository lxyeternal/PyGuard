      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It is a Discord selfbot or automation script that performs unauthorized actions such as automatically redeeming Discord Nitro gift codes via the Discord API without user consent, which is abusive and against Discord's terms of service. It also logs and exfiltrates message attachments and user data to external Discord webhooks (e.g., 'attachment_webhook' and 'nitro_webhook'), which can be used for data theft or spying. The code downloads and saves images from messages to local directories without user notification, potentially for data harvesting. It includes functions to leave or delete guilds, remove friends, create guilds, and delete channels programmatically, which can be used for disruptive or destructive actions on Discord accounts. The presence of obfuscated variable names and the use of network requests to external endpoints without clear user interaction or consent further support malicious intent. Overall, the script automates unauthorized Discord account actions, data exfiltration, and potentially disruptive operations, classifying it as malicious."
