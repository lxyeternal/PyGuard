      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports several internal modules and exposes a list of public API elements. It then attempts to spawn subprocesses to run Python commands that import the module 'shopeeloggingtool' and its 'dist_util' submodule. The subprocess calls are wrapped in try-except blocks that silently ignore failures. There is no evidence of obfuscated code, dynamic code execution (e.g., eval or exec), network communication to suspicious endpoints, file writing, or any other typical malicious behavior. The subprocess calls appear to be attempts to preload or initialize a module, possibly for logging or utility purposes, without any further suspicious actions. The code does not perform any unauthorized data exfiltration, privilege escalation, or stealth techniques. The use of subprocess.Popen to run simple import commands is not inherently malicious and may be part of legitimate initialization or environment setup. Therefore, based on the provided code and the knowledge points, this code does not contain malicious behavior."
