      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection and analysis. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the import/setup phase without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspicious package name and version, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package installation script. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns for remote code execution, persistence, or payload delivery."
