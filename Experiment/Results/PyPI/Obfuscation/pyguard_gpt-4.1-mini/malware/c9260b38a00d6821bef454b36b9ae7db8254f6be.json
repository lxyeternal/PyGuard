      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using character code escapes, dynamic eval calls, and base64 decoding combined with custom decoding functions. It dynamically imports critical modules like 'compile', 'exec', 'str.encode', 'bytes', and 'base64', then defines functions that decode and transform data in a non-transparent way. The code contains a very large base64-encoded and further obfuscated payload that is decoded and then executed dynamically via eval. This pattern of decoding an obfuscated payload and executing it at runtime is a classic hallmark of malicious code, enabling attackers to hide the true intent and evade static analysis. The code does not show any legitimate application logic, user interaction, or error handling, and the obfuscation level strongly suggests an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. Based on the extensive knowledge points, such use of eval on decoded, obfuscated data, combined with dynamic imports and execution, is a critical risk indicator of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
