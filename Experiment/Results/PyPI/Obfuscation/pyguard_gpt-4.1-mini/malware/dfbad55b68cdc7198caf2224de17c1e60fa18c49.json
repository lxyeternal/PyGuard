      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the username (os.getlogin()), hostname (platform.node()), platform details (platform.uname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the local IP address by creating a UDP socket to 8.8.8.8. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://162.62.15.24/v/<base64_data>). This behavior is consistent with system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Furthermore, this code is embedded directly in a setuptools setup script, which means it executes during package installation without user consent or interaction, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names and the absence of any legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity further indicate malicious intent. The hardcoded IP address is not associated with any known legitimate service, and the data sent includes sensitive environment details. These factors combined match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment discovery, data encoding and exfiltration, execution during package installation, and use of hardcoded suspicious endpoints."
