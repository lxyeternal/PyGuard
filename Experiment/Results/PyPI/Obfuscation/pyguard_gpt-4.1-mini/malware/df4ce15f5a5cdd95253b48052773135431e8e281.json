      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools' install command that overrides the install process to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. It collects extensive system information, including OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, network configuration ('ifconfig' or 'ipconfig'), public IP address (via 'curl ifconfig.me'), current user ('whoami'), hostname, and running processes ('tasklist' on Windows). This information is then exfiltrated via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, which is an external, non-standard endpoint unrelated to any legitimate package functionality. The use of obfuscated class and method names, execution of shell commands during installation, and immediate data exfiltration to a hardcoded external URL without user interaction or notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches known supply chain attack vectors where malicious code is embedded in package installation scripts to perform system fingerprinting and data exfiltration stealthily. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
