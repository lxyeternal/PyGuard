      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it executes a shell command during the package installation process without user consent. Specifically, the setup script subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the run() method to call a function 'notmalfunc()' after installation. This function decodes a base64-encoded string ('dHlwZSBudWwgPiBwcnVlYmExMS50eHQKZGly') which translates to the shell command 'type nul > prueba11.txt\\ndir'. It then executes this command using os.system(). Executing shell commands during installation is a known vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command further indicates an attempt to obfuscate the intent. Although the command itself is relatively benign (creating an empty file and listing directory contents), the pattern of executing obfuscated shell commands at install time without user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious intent and a potential supply chain attack vector."
