      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method to perform malicious actions during package installation. Specifically, it downloads a Python script named 'ratfinal.py' from a hardcoded Discord CDN URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1061889522541011006/1089965304202928128/ratfinal.py) without any user consent or validation. It writes this content directly to disk and then immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary remote code execution during package installation. The use of obfuscated class and method names, the lack of error handling, and the direct execution of downloaded code from an untrusted external source are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, downloading and running untrusted code, and abuse of the installation process for payload delivery."
