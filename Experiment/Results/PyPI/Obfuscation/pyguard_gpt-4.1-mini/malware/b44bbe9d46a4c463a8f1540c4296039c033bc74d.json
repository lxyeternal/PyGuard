      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded within a setup.py script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, after the legitimate setup() call, the code silently collects environment information: it retrieves the current working directory's last path component, the current user's username, and the hostname. It then constructs a string combining these values and applies a simple XOR obfuscation with a fixed byte array. This obfuscated data is base64-encoded and sent as part of a crafted HTTP GET request to a remote server. The remote server's address is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, and the connection is made to a non-standard port (octal 017620 = decimal 7904). The entire network communication is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, indicating an attempt to hide failures and avoid detection. This behavior is consistent with covert environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server without user consent or notification. The obfuscation, silent execution during package installation, and outbound network connection to a suspicious endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent, consistent with supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware."
