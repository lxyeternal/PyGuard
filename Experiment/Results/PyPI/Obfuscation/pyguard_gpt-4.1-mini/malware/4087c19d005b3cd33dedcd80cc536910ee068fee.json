      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. It is embedded in a setup/install script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code creates a hidden directory in the user's local temp folder named '__pycache__' and writes base64-encoded Python scripts ('main.cpython-39.py' and 'scripts.cpython-39.py') into this directory. These scripts are then executed asynchronously without user consent. The base64 payloads decode to code that performs environment reconnaissance (collecting user profile, hostname, platform, and other system details), enumerates user directories and files, and exfiltrates this data via HTTP POST requests to suspicious external domains (e.g., 'androidstore.devsecwise.com' and 'discord.com' webhooks). The code also uses obfuscation techniques such as randomized variable names, base64 encoding, and indirect imports to hide its intent. It spawns subprocesses with hidden windows and executes shell commands, further indicating stealthy execution. The code accesses sensitive user directories, copies files, and attempts to maintain persistence by writing to local storage and possibly modifying startup folders. Exception handling suppresses errors to avoid detection. The overall behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators including remote code execution during package installation, environment fingerprinting, data exfiltration to hardcoded suspicious endpoints, and execution of obfuscated payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious and likely part of a supply chain malware attack."
