      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to silently suppress output (redirecting stdout to os.devnull), which is a common evasion technique. It fetches a URL from a hardcoded Discord CDN link and attempts to override it with content from a Pastebin raw URL, both of which are suspicious external sources not related to legitimate package repositories. The code downloads a ZIP file from the internet (using curl to %temp%/nice.zip), extracts it, and writes a Python script named 'code.py' into a directory that is either the user's Videos folder or a Python environment directory containing 'python.exe'. It then hides this file by setting the hidden attribute and executes it via subprocess.Popen without user consent or validation. The obfuscated variable names, lack of error handling, and silent execution further indicate intent to evade detection. The overall pattern matches a classic remote payload retrieval and execution chain, typical of malware that stages and runs arbitrary code on the victim's machine. Therefore, this code is malicious."
