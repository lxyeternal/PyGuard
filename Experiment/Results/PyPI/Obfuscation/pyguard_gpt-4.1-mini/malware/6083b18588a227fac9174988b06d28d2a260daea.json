      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. Key malicious characteristics include: \n\n1. Hardcoded Discord webhook URL used for exfiltration of stolen data.\n2. Use of Windows DPAPI decryption functions (via ctypes and crypt32) to decrypt encrypted data such as browser passwords and cookies.\n3. Extensive enumeration and extraction of sensitive data from various browsers and applications, including Chrome, Opera, Brave, Discord, Steam, Telegram, and cryptocurrency wallets.\n4. Collection of environment information such as username, IP address, and geolocation, which is then formatted and sent to the attacker's webhook.\n5. Use of obfuscated and nonsensical variable and function names to hinder analysis.\n6. Copying and reading browser databases (Login Data, Cookies) and decrypting stored credentials.\n7. Uploading stolen files and data to external services (e.g., gofile.io) and sending links to the attacker.\n8. Use of threading to perform concurrent data collection and exfiltration.\n9. Killing browser processes to access locked files, then zipping and uploading them.\n10. Silent exception handling to avoid detection.\n11. Execution of code during package setup (setup function call at the end), which can trigger malicious actions upon installation.\n\nThese behaviors align with known patterns of credential and token stealers, designed to silently harvest sensitive user data and exfiltrate it to attacker-controlled endpoints without user consent or interaction. The presence of cryptographic decryption, environment fingerprinting, data exfiltration via webhooks, and targeting of multiple popular applications confirms the code is malicious."
