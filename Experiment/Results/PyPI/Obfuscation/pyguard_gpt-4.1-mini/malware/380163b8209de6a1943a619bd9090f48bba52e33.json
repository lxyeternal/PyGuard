      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines and immediately executes a function during package setup on macOS platforms that collects detailed system information by running shell commands ('uname -a', 'id', 'pwd', 'ifconfig'). It then serializes this information into JSON, encodes it in Base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http:/81.70.191.194:14333/start/). This exfiltration of system data without user consent or notification, combined with execution during package installation (setup.py), is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malware. The use of obfuscated variable names, lack of error handling, and the immediate network communication to a non-standard IP address further confirm malicious intent."
