      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspicious package metadata but no legitimate logic, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a package installation script. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload delivery, execution during package setup, and lack of user consent, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
