      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection and analysis. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating malicious intent. The code also checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. Additionally, this execution is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. The combination of hidden process execution, encoded PowerShell payload, obfuscation, and execution during setup strongly classifies this code as malicious."
