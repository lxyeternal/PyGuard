      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools' install command to register an atexit handler function that executes upon installation completion. This function writes a suspicious file 'pocbykotko.txt' with a fixed string, then collects sensitive system information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current file's directory (percent-encoded). It then encodes this combined information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with obfuscated query parameters. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it performs environment discovery, encodes sensitive data, and exfiltrates it to a hardcoded, non-standard external URL without user consent or notification. The obfuscated variable names and embedding of this logic in the install command class further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and exfiltration during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious and represents a supply chain attack vector that compromises user privacy and security by silently exfiltrating system information to an attacker-controlled server."
