      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. It first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during package setup or installation is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. There is no user interaction or consent before executing this hidden command, and the obfuscation and stealth techniques strongly indicate malicious intent."
