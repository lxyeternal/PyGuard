      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens without any user interaction or consent, and the subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The use of such obfuscated, hidden, and encoded PowerShell commands in a setup script context (distutils setup) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but does not mitigate or justify the hidden execution. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with malware patterns such as stealthy payload execution, evasion, and potential persistence or further payload download."
