      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package, which is a known supply chain attack vector. During installation, it silently collects the environment variable 'COMPUTERNAME' (the hostname on Windows systems) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL 'https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php'. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The function suppresses all exceptions, which is a common evasion technique to avoid detection. The obfuscated function and class names further indicate an attempt to hide intent. The network communication to a non-standard, suspicious domain during package installation, combined with environment fingerprinting and silent exfiltration, strongly aligns with known malicious patterns, including supply chain attacks and information stealing. Therefore, this code is malicious."
