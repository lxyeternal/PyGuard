      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the current username, hostname, and detailed platform information, then immediately sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('http://us.dslab.pw/webhook.php') without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware or reconnaissance activity. Additionally, this data exfiltration occurs during the package setup process (via setuptools.setup), meaning it triggers automatically upon installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names and the lack of legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity further support the malicious nature of this code. The hardcoded external webhook URL is not associated with any known legitimate service, increasing suspicion. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including unauthorized data exfiltration, execution during package installation, and use of suspicious external endpoints."
