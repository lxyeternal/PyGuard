      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using hexadecimal and escaped character sequences, dynamic eval calls, and base64 decoding. It dynamically imports standard modules like 'compile', 'exec', 'str.encode', 'bytes', and 'base64', then defines functions that decode and transform data in a suspicious manner. The code includes a large base64-encoded and likely compressed payload that is decoded and then executed dynamically via eval. This pattern of decoding obfuscated data and executing it at runtime is a classic hallmark of malicious code, enabling attackers to hide arbitrary payloads and evade static analysis. The code also uses dynamic imports and eval on reconstructed strings, which is a strong indicator of code injection and arbitrary code execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the obfuscation is designed to conceal the true intent. Based on the extensive knowledge points, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated payload execution, dynamic code evaluation, and use of base64 decoding to hide malicious content."
