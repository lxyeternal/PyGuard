      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain 'fo7288ar9hjgo6tp8p6c1efxpovgja7z.oastify.com'. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent or notification. The code is obfuscated with meaningless class and variable names and is embedded in the package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The external domain is non-standard and unrelated to any legitimate package repository or service. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network call during installation. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent, specifically unauthorized data exfiltration triggered automatically during package installation."
