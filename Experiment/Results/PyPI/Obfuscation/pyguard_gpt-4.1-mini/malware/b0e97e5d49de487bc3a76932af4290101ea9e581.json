      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that imports urllib.request to fetch and execute code directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/7byac/raw) without any user interaction or validation. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system shell command that runs the Python interpreter in windowed mode. This pattern of dynamically downloading and executing remote code during package setup/install is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temp file, and immediate execution of remote code fetched from an untrusted source strongly suggests a supply chain attack or malware delivery mechanism embedded in the setup script."
