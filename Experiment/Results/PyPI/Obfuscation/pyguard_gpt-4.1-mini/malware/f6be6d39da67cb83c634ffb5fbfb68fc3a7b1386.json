      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden PowerShell process, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens silently within a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection or error reporting. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The combination of hidden process execution, obfuscated encoded commands, suppression of errors, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
