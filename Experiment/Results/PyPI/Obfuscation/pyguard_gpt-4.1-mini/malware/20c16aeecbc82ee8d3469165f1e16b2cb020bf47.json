      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a temporary file and writes Python code into it that imports urllib.request.urlopen and executes code fetched from a hardcoded external URL ('https://rentry.co/ki74h/raw') without any validation or user consent. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using the Python interpreter in a new process. This pattern of dynamically downloading and executing remote code is a critical indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temporary file, and immediate execution without user interaction or validation further supports the malicious nature. This matches multiple critical risk indicators such as remote code retrieval and execution, lack of user consent, obfuscation, and execution of downloaded code, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malware."
