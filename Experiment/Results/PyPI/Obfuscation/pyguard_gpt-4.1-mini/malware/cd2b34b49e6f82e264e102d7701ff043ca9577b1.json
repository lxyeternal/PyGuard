      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains heavily obfuscated and base64-encoded strings that are decoded and executed dynamically using eval and compile, which is a classic technique to hide malicious payloads and evade static analysis. The code imports network-related modules and constructs a suspicious hardcoded URL pointing to a Discord webhook, which is commonly abused for data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of eval on decoded base64 data without any user interaction or validation strongly suggest unauthorized code execution. The try-except block suppresses all exceptions, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. The overall pattern matches known malicious behaviors such as remote payload retrieval, dynamic code execution, and stealthy operation, consistent with supply chain attacks or backdoor implants. Therefore, this code is malicious."
