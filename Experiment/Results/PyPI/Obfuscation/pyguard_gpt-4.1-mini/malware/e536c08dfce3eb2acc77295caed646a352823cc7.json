      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It contains extensive use of obfuscation techniques, including repeated base64 and base16 encoded data, zlib compression, and marshal serialization, which are dynamically decoded and executed via exec(). This pattern is a hallmark of malware attempting to hide its true intent and evade static analysis. The code imports numerous modules commonly used in malicious scripts (e.g., requests, os, asyncio, telethon for Telegram interaction) and uses obfuscated function and variable names, further indicating an attempt to conceal functionality. The presence of asynchronous functions that respond to specific commands (e.g., 'webshare') and execute large blocks of obfuscated code suggests command-and-control or payload delivery mechanisms. Additionally, the code attempts to send files and delete messages asynchronously, which may be used for stealthy operations or data exfiltration. The overall structure, heavy obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network-related operations without user interaction or clear legitimate purpose strongly classify this code as malicious."
