      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. It is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The function jAxZxNMDdKcMmmxsMSQwTaCaIKTLduTx() attempts to establish a TCP connection to a hardcoded external IP address (3.228.3.164) on port 80 without any user interaction or consent. Upon successful connection, it duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), then spawns an interactive bash shell via pty.spawn('/bin/bash'). This sequence is a classic reverse shell payload, enabling remote command execution and control of the victim system. Additionally, the function yBcjEHzJDlKWsLucLDlNHZLqNUcjDwnU collects sensitive process information from the /proc filesystem and writes it to a local file 'proc_info.txt', which could be used for system fingerprinting or reconnaissance. The reverse shell function is invoked automatically during the package installation and egg_info commands by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and egg_info classes and overriding their methods to call the malicious function. This means the malicious payload executes silently during package installation, a known supply chain attack technique. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to hinder analysis. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent, and the hardcoded IP address is suspicious and unrelated to any known benign service. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious and designed to provide unauthorized remote access to the host system."
