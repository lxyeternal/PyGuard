The decoded payload performs the following malicious actions: it imports urllib.request, downloads and executes code from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://137.117.157.128:1337/inject/0QYBNYlVFs4XlT4C), writes the downloaded content to a temporary file, executes it, and then deletes the temporary file. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code without user consent, combined with obfuscation via base64 encoding and dynamic execution, is a classic hallmark of malware. The use of a hardcoded IP address and port, lack of error handling, and immediate execution of remote code strongly indicate malicious intent."

The decoded payload imports modules for temporary file handling and system execution, then downloads and executes code from a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://137.117.157.128:1337/inject/0QYBNYlVFs4XlT4C). This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, fetching and running remote code without user consent, and dynamic code execution from an external source. Additionally, the obfuscated imports and variable names, combined with the execution of downloaded code, strongly suggest this script is designed for unauthorized remote code execution or a backdoor. The rest of the code appears to be obfuscated and unrelated to benign functionality, further supporting the malicious classification."
