      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses base64 decoding combined with marshal.loads to deserialize and immediately execute obfuscated bytecode via exec. This is a classic technique to hide malicious payloads and evade static analysis. The embedded payload contains a suspicious hardcoded URL (https://pixeldrain.com/api/file/Km41s68f?downloadz) which is not a standard or trusted domain, indicating it attempts to download or interact with external resources without user consent. The use of marshal and base64 to encode executable code, followed by direct execution, is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and fetching code from suspicious external URLs. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
