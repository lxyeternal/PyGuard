      "malicious_behavior": "The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. It conditionally installs a Windows-specific package (pypiwin32) if missing, then proceeds to create a hidden directory under the user's APPDATA folder named 'Extension'. It writes an obfuscated JavaScript background script and a manifest.json file for a Chrome extension into this directory. The JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and repeatedly manipulates the clipboard, replacing user input with hardcoded cryptocurrency addresses, which is a classic clipboard hijacking technique aimed at stealing cryptocurrency transactions. The script sets up a repeating interval to perform this clipboard replacement stealthily. Furthermore, the code enumerates common Windows shortcut locations including the Start Menu, Taskbar pinned items, and Desktop, and modifies shortcuts to popular browsers (chrome.exe, msedge.exe, brave.exe, launcher.exe) to add a command-line argument that loads the malicious extension silently on browser startup. It also escalates persistence by adding the extension to the all-users Start Menu folder if running with admin privileges. The entire operation is done without user consent or notification, silently injecting malicious code into browser sessions and hijacking clipboard data to redirect cryptocurrency transactions. These behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload embedded in install script, creation of hidden directories and files in user/system folders, clipboard hijacking, stealthy persistence via shortcut modification, and execution triggered during package installation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
