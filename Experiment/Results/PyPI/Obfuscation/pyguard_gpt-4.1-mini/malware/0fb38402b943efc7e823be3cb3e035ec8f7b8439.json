      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and uses multiple layers of encoding and character substitution to hide its true intent. It decodes a large base64-encoded string, then applies a complex character mapping to reconstruct a Python code string, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of obfuscation and dynamic execution is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. Such techniques are commonly used to evade static analysis and hide payloads that perform unauthorized or harmful actions. The use of exec on dynamically decoded and transformed data is a critical red flag, as it allows arbitrary code execution without user consent or visibility. Given the extensive obfuscation, lack of transparency, and dynamic execution, this code is very likely to contain malicious payloads or behaviors."
