      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The subprocess call suppresses the window and runs the command in the background without user consent or interaction. This behavior is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of encoded PowerShell commands, hidden execution, and conditional directory checks strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns for stealthy payload delivery and execution."
