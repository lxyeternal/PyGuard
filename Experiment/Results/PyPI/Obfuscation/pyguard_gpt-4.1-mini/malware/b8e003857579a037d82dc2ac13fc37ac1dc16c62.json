      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that registers a function to run at exit during package installation. This function writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with a suspicious message, then collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current file's directory (percent-encoded). It concatenates and base64-encodes this data, then sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with a crafted query parameter. This sequence is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent, triggered automatically during package installation (a known supply chain attack vector). The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded suspicious URLs, base64 encoding to evade detection, and execution of code during the install phase all strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, and no user interaction or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
