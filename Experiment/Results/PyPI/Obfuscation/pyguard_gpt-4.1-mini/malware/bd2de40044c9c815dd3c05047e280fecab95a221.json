      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the hostname, username, a hardcoded string resembling a package name, and the current working directory. It encodes this information in base64, then further obfuscates it by converting characters to hex and appending random values. It constructs domain names and subdomains that appear suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate service (e.g., deliverycontent.online). The script then sends this encoded and obfuscated system information to these suspicious external domains via multiple HTTP requests using urllib and requests libraries, both GET and POST methods, without any user interaction or consent. Additionally, it executes multiple 'ping' commands to these constructed domain names, which is a known covert channel technique to exfiltrate data via DNS or ICMP requests. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection. The obfuscation, hardcoded suspicious domains, environment fingerprinting, and unsolicited network communication to external servers are classic hallmarks of malicious behavior, specifically information stealing and data exfiltration. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent, and the code uses multiple redundant methods to ensure data transmission, indicating an intent to evade detection and ensure successful exfiltration."
