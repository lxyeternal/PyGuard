      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs at import or setup time without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding the execution. These factors combined—hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command during package setup/install, obfuscation, stealth techniques, and suspicious directory checks—are hallmark signs of malware. Therefore, the code is malicious."
