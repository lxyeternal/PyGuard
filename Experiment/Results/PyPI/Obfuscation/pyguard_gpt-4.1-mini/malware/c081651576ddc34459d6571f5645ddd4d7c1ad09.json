      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is malicious. It is a setup script that includes an obfuscated payload executed only on Windows systems during installation or build distribution commands. The code decodes a large base64-encoded string and executes it via exec(), which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload is a PowerShell command executed with hidden window style, which is a known technique for stealthy execution. The overall structure, including obfuscation, conditional execution during package installation, and hidden execution of a large encoded payload, matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, such as arbitrary code execution, evasion, and potential persistence or payload delivery. This behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks or malicious PyPI packages that execute harmful code during installation without user consent."
