      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to disk as 'download.exe' and immediately executes it using os.startfile. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables remote payload retrieval and execution without transparency or safeguards. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded URL to fetch an executable and the immediate execution of that file strongly suggest a malware delivery mechanism. There is no legitimate application logic, error handling, or user notification, which further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."
