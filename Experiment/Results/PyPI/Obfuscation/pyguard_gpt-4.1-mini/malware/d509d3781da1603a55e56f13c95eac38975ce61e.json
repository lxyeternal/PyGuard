      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It embeds a base64-encoded shell command that is executed during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). This command uses 'pip install requests' and then runs a Python script that fetches a remote executable payload from a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/Exet75/neofetch/blob/main/ip_checker.exe?raw=true), writes it to disk, and executes it. This pattern of executing obfuscated shell commands during installation, downloading and running an executable from an external source without user consent, and embedding this logic in the setup.py install hook is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, execution via os.system, and the lack of any legitimate application logic around this behavior further confirm the malicious nature."
