      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks enabling code execution during package installation without user consent. The script attempts to ensure the 'requests' and 'subprocess' modules are installed, then creates a suspicious hidden directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' on a Windows system, which is not a standard or benign directory. It downloads two executable files from hardcoded, non-standard URLs hosted on Discord's CDN, writes them to this hidden directory with obfuscated filenames, and immediately executes them using os.startfile. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, avoiding detection and error reporting. After execution, it attempts to delete the hidden directory, indicating anti-forensics or cleanup behavior. The combination of downloading executables from untrusted external sources, writing them to a hidden system directory, executing them without user interaction or validation, and embedding this behavior in a package setup script is a classic pattern of malware delivery and execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
