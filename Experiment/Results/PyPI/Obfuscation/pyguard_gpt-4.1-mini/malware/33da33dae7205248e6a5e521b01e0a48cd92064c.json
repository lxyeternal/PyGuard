      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the install process of a Python package. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows attackers to hide the true payload and execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine during package installation. Additionally, the package setup specifies dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in this malicious install hook. The obfuscated variable names and encrypted payload further confirm the attempt to evade detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with a supply chain attack vector that executes hidden code during package installation."
