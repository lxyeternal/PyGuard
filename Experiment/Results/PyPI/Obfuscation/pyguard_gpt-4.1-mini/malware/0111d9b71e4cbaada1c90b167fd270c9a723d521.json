      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing obfuscated and encrypted code during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution in setup/install scripts is a known supply chain attack vector. Additionally, the code imports network communication libraries (requests) but does not show explicit network calls here, suggesting the decrypted payload likely performs further malicious actions such as network communication or code execution. The obfuscation of variable and class names further supports the intent to hide malicious behavior. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators including arbitrary code execution at install time, use of encrypted payloads, obfuscation, and execution of decrypted code, all consistent with malware patterns."
