      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads content from a given URL without any validation or user consent, writes it to a randomly named directory inside the system's temporary directory, and immediately executes the downloaded file using subprocess.run. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior: fetching and executing remote code without user interaction or verification. The use of a random directory name for storing the downloaded file is a common evasion technique. There is no error handling around subprocess execution, no logging, and no indication that the downloaded content is safe or trusted. The code effectively enables remote code execution from arbitrary URLs, which is a critical security risk and a strong indicator of malware."
