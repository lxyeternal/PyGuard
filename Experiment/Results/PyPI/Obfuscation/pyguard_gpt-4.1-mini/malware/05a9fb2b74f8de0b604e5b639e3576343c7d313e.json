      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence check. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. These behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including hidden execution of obfuscated PowerShell commands during package installation, lack of user consent, obfuscation, and stealth techniques. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
