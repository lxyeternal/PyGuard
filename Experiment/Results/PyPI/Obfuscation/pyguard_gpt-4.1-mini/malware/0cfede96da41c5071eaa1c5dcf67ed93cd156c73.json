      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines custom setuptools commands (install, develop, egg_info) that override the standard behavior to execute a shell command during package installation or development setup. Specifically, it calls subprocess.call with 'sudo /home/pi/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/motivate1234/run_echo' using shell=True. This means that upon installation or development setup, an external executable or script located at a suspicious, hardcoded path is run with elevated privileges (sudo). This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, where arbitrary code execution is triggered during package installation without user interaction or consent. The use of a hardcoded path to a non-standard executable, the invocation of sudo, and execution during install hooks are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the code is embedded in the setup script, which is a known pattern for malware delivery in Python packages."
