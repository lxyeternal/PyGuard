      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that collects all environment variables (os.environ), encodes them, and attempts to send them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app), which is a non-standard domain and likely attacker-controlled. This function is called immediately at the end of the script and also hooked into the setuptools install and develop commands, causing it to execute automatically during package installation or development setup without user consent. The function name and variable names are obfuscated, and the code is embedded in the package setup script, a common supply chain attack vector. The code lacks error handling and user notification, and it exfiltrates potentially sensitive environment data to an external server. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, execution during package installation, use of suspicious hardcoded URLs, and obfuscation, confirming that the code is malicious."
