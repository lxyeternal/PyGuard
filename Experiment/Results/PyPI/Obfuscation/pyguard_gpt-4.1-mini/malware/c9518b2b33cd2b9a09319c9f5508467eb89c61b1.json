      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install with an obfuscated class name and overrides a method that is presumably the install method (though the method name is obfuscated). During installation, it collects sensitive environment information: the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), the current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://9.30.214.68:9090) without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated names, hardcoded external IP, and execution of network communication during install time without transparency or user consent strongly indicates malicious intent."
