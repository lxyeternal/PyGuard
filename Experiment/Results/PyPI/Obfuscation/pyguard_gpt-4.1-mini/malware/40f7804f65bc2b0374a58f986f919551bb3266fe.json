      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary executable from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node') without any user interaction or validation, writes it to a temporary directory (/tmp/node), makes it executable, and then runs it with a command line argument pointing to a hidden file (/tmp/.gitler). This behavior is characteristic of a remote payload retrieval and execution pattern, commonly used in malware for staging and persistence. The function is invoked immediately during package setup, meaning the malicious payload executes during installation without user consent. The use of a non-standard URL, writing and executing files in /tmp with obfuscated filenames, and executing shell commands via os.system in a setup script are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the empty write to '/tmp/.gitler' suggests preparation for the payload execution environment. The absence of error handling beyond printing a traceback and the obfuscated function name further support the malicious nature. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware vectors."
