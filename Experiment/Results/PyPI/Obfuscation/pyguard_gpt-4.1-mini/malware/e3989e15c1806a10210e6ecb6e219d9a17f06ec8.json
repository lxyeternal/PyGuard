      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including the contents of sensitive files (/etc/passwd, /etc/hosts), environment variables, current directory listing, process list, and user home directory files. It then serializes this data into JSON, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP request to a suspicious external URL ('https://pypi.org/reqs?d=' with a forged Host header 'psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'). The obfuscated variable names, silent exception handling, and the exfiltration of sensitive system and environment data without user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the payload and the transmission to a non-standard endpoint further support this conclusion. This behavior matches known patterns of information-stealing malware that perform system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
