      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command via subprocess with shell=True that performs a curl POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eot0n2yp3autvqq.m.pipedream.net). The POST request headers and data include sensitive system information such as the hostname, current user (whoami), current working directory (pwd), directory listing (ls -la), and user identity (id). This is done without any user interaction or consent, indicating automated data exfiltration. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain (pipedream.net) for data transmission, combined with the collection and exfiltration of detailed system information, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware or reconnaissance activity. The obfuscated function and variable names further suggest an attempt to hide intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides an install method with an obfuscated name. Inside this method, it calls a function LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP imported from a suspiciously named module pre_install. The function and class names are obfuscated and meaningless, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The setup() call uses a suspicious package name 'aibl0dtrt1g94h7k' and a non-standard, likely fake download_url 'http://notapplicdable.notdapplicable'. The install command subclass is used to execute code during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The call to LcLPLqABsalXjuxIuWGdfMJiVFQKYPnP() during install likely triggers hidden malicious actions without user consent. The obfuscation, use of install hook for code execution, and suspicious URLs strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery during package installation."
