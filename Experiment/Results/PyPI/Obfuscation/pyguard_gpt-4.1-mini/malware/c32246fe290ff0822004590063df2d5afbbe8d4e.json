      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method that is executed during package installation. Inside this method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. The decrypted payload is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code is embedded in the package installation process to run hidden payloads. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during setup install phase strongly indicates malicious intent. The setup call also specifies Windows as the target OS, and the install command is replaced with this malicious subclass. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code uses cryptography to hide the payload, which is executed silently. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscation, and use of external dependencies for malicious activity."
