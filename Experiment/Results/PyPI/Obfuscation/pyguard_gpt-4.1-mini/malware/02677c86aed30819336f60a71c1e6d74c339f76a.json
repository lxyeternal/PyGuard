      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract a sensitive authentication token (the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie) from the Windows registry path associated with Roblox Studio. It then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint not related to the legitimate application. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration. The code performs this action without any user interaction, consent, or notification, and it suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for exfiltration, combined with reading sensitive data from the registry and sending it externally, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically credential stealing malware."
