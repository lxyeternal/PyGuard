      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which during package installation writes a Python script named 'remote-access.py' containing a reverse shell payload that executes a bash command to open an interactive shell connected to a hardcoded IP address (10.3.0.95) on port 4444. This script is moved to the user's home directory and executed silently via subprocess.Popen without user consent or notification. This pattern is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell technique, enabling unauthorized remote control of the victim's system. The use of hardcoded IP, execution of shell commands during package installation, writing and running files in the user's home directory, and suppression of exceptions all strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware."
