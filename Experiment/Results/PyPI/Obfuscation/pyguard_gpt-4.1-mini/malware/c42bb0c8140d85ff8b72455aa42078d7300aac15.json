      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install process, embedding malicious code execution during package installation (a known supply chain attack vector). Specifically, in the overridden method dAFbLMQjOCbEuFIeVLqPhWLqyGHTSawd, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This dynamic decryption and execution of obfuscated code at install time without user consent is a critical indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscation of variable and class names, the use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution triggered during installation strongly suggest this is designed to run unauthorized code on the victim's system. The code also restricts execution to Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is common in targeted malware. The presence of 'requests' hints at possible network activity in the decrypted payload, further increasing risk. Overall, this pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators of malware, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscation, and use of encrypted payloads."
