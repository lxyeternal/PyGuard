      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It imports numerous libraries commonly used for system and network information gathering, cryptography, and web requests. The code collects extensive system information including hostname, local and public IP addresses, MAC address, geolocation data, CPU, memory, disk, and network statistics. It attempts to locate and extract Discord tokens and browser cookies from various installed browsers and Discord clients by scanning local storage files and decrypting encrypted credentials using Windows DPAPI and Chrome's encrypted key. The extracted tokens and credentials are then exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, a known technique for covert data theft. The code also attempts to capture screenshots and package stolen passwords into zip files for exfiltration. It uses obfuscated variable and function names to hinder analysis and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The presence of hardcoded external webhook URLs, extensive environment and credential harvesting, cryptographic decryption of sensitive data, and immediate outbound HTTP POST requests with stolen data are hallmark signs of malicious intent. There is no legitimate user interaction, consent, or benign application logic surrounding these actions. Therefore, this code is conclusively malicious and designed for credential theft and data exfiltration."
