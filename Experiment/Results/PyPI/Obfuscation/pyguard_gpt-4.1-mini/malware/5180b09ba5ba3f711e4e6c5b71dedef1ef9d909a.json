      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, likely to ensure the malicious payload can be decrypted and executed. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payloads, and execution of arbitrary code from decrypted data. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
