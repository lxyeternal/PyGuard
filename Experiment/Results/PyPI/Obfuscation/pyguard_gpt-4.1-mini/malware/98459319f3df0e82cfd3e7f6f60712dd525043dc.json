      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which triggers execution during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The code contains a large base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically via exec(), a hallmark of obfuscated malware. It conditionally executes different payloads depending on the operating system, with the Windows branch decoding and executing a large obfuscated script that writes and runs an executable in a temporary directory with a suspicious filename. The Linux branch performs network communication to suspicious endpoints, collects environment and system information, and sends it to hardcoded URLs unrelated to legitimate package sources. The code uses obfuscation techniques such as base64 encoding, dynamic imports, and indirect function calls to hide its intent. It performs environment discovery, writes files to system or user directories without consent, and executes shell commands, all without user interaction or notification. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns including remote code execution, data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms, and evasion of static analysis. Therefore, this code is conclusively malicious."
