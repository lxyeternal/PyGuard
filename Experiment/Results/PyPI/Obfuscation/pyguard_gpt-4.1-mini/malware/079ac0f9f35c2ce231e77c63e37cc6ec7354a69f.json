      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. Key malicious characteristics include:\n\n1. Hardcoded Discord webhook URL: The code contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL used to exfiltrate stolen data.\n\n2. Credential and token theft: The code searches for and decrypts sensitive data such as browser cookies, passwords, Discord tokens, and wallet information from various user directories and browser storage files.\n\n3. Use of Windows DPAPI decryption: The code uses Windows cryptographic APIs to decrypt encrypted browser data, a common technique in credential stealers.\n\n4. Obfuscated and misleading variable and function names: The code uses nonsensical, obfuscated names to hide its intent.\n\n5. Network exfiltration: Stolen data is serialized and sent via HTTP POST requests to the hardcoded Discord webhook.\n\n6. Threading and process manipulation: The code uses multiple threads to concurrently steal data from different locations and forcibly terminates processes (e.g., browsers) to access locked files.\n\n7. File system enumeration: The code enumerates user directories such as AppData, LocalAppData, and Temp to locate and extract sensitive files.\n\n8. Use of cryptography (AES) to decrypt data and base64 decoding to handle obfuscated payloads.\n\n9. Silent exception handling and suppression to avoid detection.\n\n10. Execution embedded in a setuptools setup script, which can trigger execution during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector.\n\nOverall, the code is a credential stealer designed to harvest sensitive user data from browsers and Discord clients and exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled Discord webhook without user consent or interaction."
