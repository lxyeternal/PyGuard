      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides an install method to perform additional actions during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. It collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and username (getpass.getuser()) without user consent. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eomreq4blox8fea.m.pipedream.net), which is not a standard or trusted domain and is commonly used for capturing exfiltrated data in testing or malicious contexts. The class and method names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data collection and exfiltration. This pattern is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration triggered automatically during package installation, consistent with malicious behavior and supply chain attacks."
