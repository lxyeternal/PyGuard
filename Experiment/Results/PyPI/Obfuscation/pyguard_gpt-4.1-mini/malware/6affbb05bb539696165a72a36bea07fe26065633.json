      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed at install time via exec(), which is a critical red flag for malicious behavior. The decoded payload performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious hardcoded URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/hEF5HaFc), sets headers mimicking a browser user-agent, reads the response content, writes it to a file named 'pkg_installer.exe', and then executes this file using os.system. Immediately after, it attempts to remove the executable file. This sequence is a classic download-and-execute pattern used in malware to fetch and run a remote payload without user consent. The execution occurs during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hardcoded suspicious URL, writing and executing a binary file, and cleanup (file removal) strongly indicate malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a high security risk."
