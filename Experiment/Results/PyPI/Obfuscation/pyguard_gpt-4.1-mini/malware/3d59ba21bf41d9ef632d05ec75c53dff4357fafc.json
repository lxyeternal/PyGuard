      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method to execute a shell command during package installation. The shell command creates a reverse shell by opening a TCP socket to a hardcoded suspicious domain 'e6j4342057.zicp.fun' on port 26264, duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, disables shell history, and spawns a bash shell. The command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system, which is a classic obfuscation technique to evade detection. This behavior occurs automatically during the package installation process without user consent or interaction, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a reverse shell to connect to an external, non-standard domain, combined with obfuscation and execution at install time, is a definitive indicator of malicious intent, consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors. Therefore, this code contains highly malicious behavior."
