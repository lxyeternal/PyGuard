      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method that decrypts and executes an encrypted payload at install time without user consent. The payload is decrypted using a hardcoded Fernet key and executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. The code imports 'requests' and 'fernet' only if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), indicating platform-specific malicious behavior. The encrypted payload is embedded as a base64-encoded Fernet ciphertext, hiding its true intent and evading static analysis. This execution occurs during the package installation process (setup.py), a known supply chain attack vector. The setup call specifies setup_requires=['fernet', 'requests'], ensuring these dependencies are installed to support the malicious payload execution. The obfuscated variable and class names further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. There is no user interaction, logging, or error handling, and the code executes arbitrary decrypted code at install time, which is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and arbitrary remote code execution."
