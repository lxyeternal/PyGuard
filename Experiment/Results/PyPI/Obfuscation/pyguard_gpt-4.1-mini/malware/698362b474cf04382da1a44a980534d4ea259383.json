      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent. It then validates the stolen cookie and, if valid, collects detailed user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, creation date, and profile URLs via Roblox APIs. It also fetches the public IP address of the victim's machine. All this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. There is no user interaction or consent, and the behavior aligns with credential theft and data exfiltration malware patterns. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, automated cookie stealing from browsers, and immediate data exfiltration without user knowledge are strong indicators of malicious intent."
