      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on Discord's CDN ('https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/.../stub.exe') without any user interaction or consent. The downloaded file is saved as 'FILE.exe' and immediately executed via os.system with a command that attempts to run it with 'RunAsInvoker' privilege level, which is a known technique to bypass privilege escalation prompts. This download-and-execute pattern is embedded within custom install and develop commands of setuptools, meaning the malicious payload is triggered automatically during package installation or development setup, a classic supply chain attack vector. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to hide intent, and there is no validation, user notification, or error handling around the network or execution operations. The use of requests to fetch an executable and immediate execution without integrity checks or user consent is a critical risk and a hallmark of malware. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and run a potentially harmful executable during package installation, which is a highly malicious behavior."
