      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) or information-stealing malware. It establishes a persistent outbound TCP connection to a hardcoded suspicious domain (securedmaininfo5.zapto.org) on port 3000 without user consent. It collects detailed system information including hostname, OS version, username, and environment variables, and sends this data to the remote server. The code implements keylogging functionality using pynput.keyboard to capture keystrokes silently and exfiltrates the captured data. It can take screenshots and send them to the attacker. It enumerates drives and directories, allowing remote browsing of the victim's file system. It supports remote file upload and download, writing arbitrary files to disk and reading files for exfiltration. It can lock the workstation, shutdown or restart the system, and execute arbitrary shell commands remotely. It attempts to add itself to Windows startup via registry modification for persistence. It includes functionality to steal saved Chrome passwords by accessing and decrypting the Chrome Login Data SQLite database using Windows DPAPI. It can disable Task Manager by monitoring and terminating its process, showing a popup message to the user. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to hinder analysis. It writes and executes VBScript files to display messages or monitor processes. The overall behavior—silent remote control, credential theft, persistence, keylogging, file system access, and system manipulation—matches known malicious RAT and info-stealer patterns. There is no legitimate user interaction or consent, and the code is designed to evade detection and maintain stealthy control over the victim system."
