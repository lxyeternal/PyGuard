      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a reverse shell payload. Specifically, during installation, it constructs a shell command that creates a TCP socket connecting to a hardcoded IP address (13.93.28.37) on port 8888. It duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, sets the HISTFILE environment variable to /dev/null to avoid shell history logging, and spawns an interactive bash shell. The payload command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system, which is a classic obfuscation technique to evade detection. This behavior enables an attacker to gain remote shell access to the victim machine immediately upon package installation, without any user interaction or consent. Embedding such a reverse shell in the install hook of a Python package is a well-known supply chain attack vector and is a critical security risk. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded external IP, base64 encoding, and execution of shell commands during installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
