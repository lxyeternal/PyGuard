      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily extract saved passwords from the Google Chrome browser on a Windows system by accessing the Chrome 'Login Data' SQLite database and decrypting stored passwords using Windows DPAPI and AES decryption. It collects the user's login credentials (website URL, username, and decrypted password) and writes them to a local file named 'passwords.txt'. Subsequently, it exfiltrates this sensitive information by sending the 'passwords.txt' file to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via an HTTP POST request, without any user consent or interaction. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The presence of a hardcoded external webhook URL, the extraction and decryption of sensitive credential data, and the exfiltration of this data to an external server are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with credential-stealing malware."
