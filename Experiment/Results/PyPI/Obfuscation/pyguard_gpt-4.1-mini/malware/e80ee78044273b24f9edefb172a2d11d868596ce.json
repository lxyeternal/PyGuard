      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. Key malicious aspects include:\n\n1. Obfuscated and encoded payload: The code contains a large base64-encoded string that is decoded and written to a temporary directory under a suspicious folder name '__pycache__'. This payload is then executed via a VBScript file, which is also written dynamically and executed with no user interaction.\n\n2. Execution during package installation: The code is embedded in a setup script context and triggers execution immediately if certain command-line arguments are present (e.g., 'install'), which is a common supply chain attack vector.\n\n3. Use of environment variables and system paths: It accesses the USERPROFILE environment variable and writes files to the user's appdata local temp directory, a typical staging area for malware.\n\n4. Execution of shell commands: The decoded payload runs multiple shell commands to install various Python packages (aiofiles, aiohttp, cryptography, etc.) using pip, which may be used to prepare the environment for further malicious activity.\n\n5. Writing and executing a VBScript file: The script writes a VBScript that runs a Python script in hidden mode, a known technique to evade user detection.\n\n6. Lack of user consent or interaction: All actions are performed silently without any prompts or notifications.\n\n7. Obfuscation and misleading variable names: The code uses meaningless variable names and indirect function calls to hide its intent.\n\n8. The overall structure and behavior match multiple critical risk patterns such as dynamic code execution from obfuscated sources, execution of shell commands in hidden mode, writing and running temporary scripts, and execution triggered during package installation.\n\nGiven these factors, the code is highly likely to be malicious and designed to execute unauthorized code on the victim's system, potentially for persistence, payload delivery, or data exfiltration."
