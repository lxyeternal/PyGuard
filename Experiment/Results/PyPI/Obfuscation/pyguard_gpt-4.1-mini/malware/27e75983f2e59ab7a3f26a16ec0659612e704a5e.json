      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, it checks if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and decrypted with a fixed key, then executed via exec(). This pattern of embedding encrypted payloads in setup/install scripts and executing them at install time is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of 'requests' suggests potential network activity, and the encrypted payload likely contains malicious code. The obfuscated variable names and the execution of decrypted code during installation without user consent strongly indicate malicious intent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payloads, and execution of network-related modules in an install hook. Therefore, this code is malicious."
