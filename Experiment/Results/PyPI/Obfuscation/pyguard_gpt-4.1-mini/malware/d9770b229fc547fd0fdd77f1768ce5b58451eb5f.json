It then immediately executes this script using os.system with the Python interpreter, effectively running arbitrary remote code on the user's machine. This pattern of dynamically downloading and executing code during package setup/install is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior, commonly used in supply chain attacks and malware delivery. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temporary file, and executing it without transparency or safeguards further confirms the malicious intent."

It then closes the file and immediately executes it using a system shell command that launches a new Python interpreter process. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code dynamically, combined with writing to a temp file and spawning a new process without user interaction or validation, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated variable names and indirect imports further supports the intent to evade detection. According to the provided knowledge points, executing code fetched from an external URL via exec(), writing it to disk, and running it without validation is a critical risk indicator of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
