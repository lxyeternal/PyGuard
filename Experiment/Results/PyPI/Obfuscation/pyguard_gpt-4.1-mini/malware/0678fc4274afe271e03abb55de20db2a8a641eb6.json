      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install with an obfuscated class name and overrides a method (also obfuscated). During the installation process, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/284099f8-6eea-45be-9c3c-3b6b0f9ccb0e), which is a known service used for capturing webhooks and often abused for data exfiltration. The data exfiltration occurs silently during package installation without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated names, embedding this behavior in the install command, and exfiltration of system-specific data to an external, suspicious endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including supply chain attack vectors, environment fingerprinting, and unauthorized data exfiltration."
