      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules dynamically, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload (a long base64-encoded string). The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. This execution happens silently during the install phase without user consent or interaction, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during setup installation strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also restricts execution to Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), which is typical for targeted malware. The setup call includes 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup_requires dependencies, indicating these are needed for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated encrypted payload, dynamic import and execution during install, no user interaction, and use of cryptography to hide payload. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
