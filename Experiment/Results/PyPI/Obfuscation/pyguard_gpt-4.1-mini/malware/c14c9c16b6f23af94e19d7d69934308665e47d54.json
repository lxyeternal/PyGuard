      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install with an obfuscated class name and method name. Inside the overridden install method (though the method name is obfuscated and does not match the standard 'run'), it calls subprocess with an obfuscated method name on sys.executable to run a module named 'poc_nvk.my_module'. This means that during package installation, it executes arbitrary Python code from a module that is not part of the standard installation process. The obfuscation of class and method names, combined with execution of subprocess during install, is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: code execution during package installation, obfuscation, and execution of subprocess commands without validation or user interaction. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including hostname, operating system name, and IP address, then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eowdq5q6u6qkhxe.m.pipedream.net/poc) without any user interaction or consent. The use of an obscure, non-corporate domain (pipedream.net endpoint) for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious behavior. There is no legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity, and the code executes immediately upon running the script, further indicating it is designed for covert data exfiltration. These factors align with known patterns of information-stealing malware that fingerprint the host and exfiltrate data to attacker-controlled servers."
