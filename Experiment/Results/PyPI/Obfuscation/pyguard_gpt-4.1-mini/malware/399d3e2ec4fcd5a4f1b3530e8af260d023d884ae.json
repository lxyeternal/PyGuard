      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The script attempts to ensure the 'requests' module is installed dynamically, then creates a suspicious hidden directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' on a Windows system. It downloads two executable files from hardcoded, non-standard URLs hosted on Discord's CDN, saves them with obfuscated names in the hidden directory, and then executes these files immediately without any user consent or validation. The script also attempts to clean up by deleting the directory afterward, indicating anti-forensics behavior. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded external URLs for executable payloads, silent exception handling, and immediate execution of downloaded binaries are classic hallmarks of malware. This pattern is strongly associated with remote payload retrieval, local persistence, and arbitrary code execution, all of which are critical risk factors for malicious activity."
