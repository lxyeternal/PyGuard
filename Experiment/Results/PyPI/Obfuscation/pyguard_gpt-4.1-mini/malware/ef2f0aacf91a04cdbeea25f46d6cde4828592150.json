      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. It checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with obfuscation and silent exception handling, strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but does not mitigate the risk posed by the hidden PowerShell execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy payload execution and potential system compromise."
