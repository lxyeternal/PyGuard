      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that collects all environment variables (os.environ), encodes them, and attempts to send them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL hosted on an ngrok-free.app domain, which is commonly used for temporary or attacker-controlled endpoints. This function is called immediately at the end of the script and also hooked into setuptools installation commands (install, develop, egg_info), meaning it will execute automatically during package installation or development setup without user consent or interaction. The function name and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common evasion technique. The code attempts to send potentially sensitive environment data to an external server, which constitutes data exfiltration. The use of a hardcoded suspicious URL, automatic execution during package installation, obfuscation, and environment data exfiltration are all classic hallmarks of malicious code, especially in the context of supply chain attacks via Python packages."
