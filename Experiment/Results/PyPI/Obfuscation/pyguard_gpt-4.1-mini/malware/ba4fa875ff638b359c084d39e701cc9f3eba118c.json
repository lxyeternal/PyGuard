      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This execution occurs at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with no legitimate application logic or user consent, matches multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, and execution during installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
