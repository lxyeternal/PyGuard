      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('winsysupdate.exe') from a hardcoded, external URL hosted on Discord's CDN, writes it directly to disk without any validation or user consent, and immediately executes it using os.system. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The absence of any user interaction, validation, or legitimate application logic around this network activity, combined with the direct execution of a downloaded executable, strongly indicates malicious intent. The use of a hardcoded URL to fetch an executable and run it without transparency or safeguards is a critical risk and a well-known vector for malware infection."
