      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL (https://pastebin.com/raw/3xcr2My4) and immediately uses the retrieved content as a URL to send a POST request with a payload that appears to be a spam or notification message ('new run @everyone'). This is unsolicited network communication without user consent. Then, it generates a random filename and downloads another Python script from another suspicious URL (https://utilities.tk/rscode?r=mewhenrscode), writes it to disk, and immediately executes it via subprocess.Popen with shell=True. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code without validation or user interaction is a classic malware behavior, often used for payload delivery and remote code execution. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of random filenames for the downloaded script further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The combination of unsolicited network communication, remote code download, file writing, and immediate execution in an installation script context confirms the code is malicious."
