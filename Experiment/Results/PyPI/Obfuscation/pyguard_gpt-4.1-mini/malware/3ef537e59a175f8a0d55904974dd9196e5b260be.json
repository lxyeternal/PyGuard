      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute a shell command using subprocess. This command fetches code from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://13.93.28.37:8080/p) using curl and pipes it directly to perl for execution. This occurs during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address, execution of remote code fetched at install time, obfuscated class and method names, and execution of shell commands in the install hook are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern enables arbitrary remote code execution on the victim's system during package installation, which is a critical security risk."
