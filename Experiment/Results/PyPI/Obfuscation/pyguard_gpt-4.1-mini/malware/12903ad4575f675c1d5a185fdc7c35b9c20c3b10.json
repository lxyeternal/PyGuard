      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method to execute encrypted and obfuscated code during package installation. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This occurs conditionally only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). The payload is embedded in the setup.py install process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time without user consent or transparency strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', likely to support the malicious payload's network or cryptographic operations. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscation, encrypted payload execution, and use of network libraries for potential exfiltration or further payload retrieval. Therefore, this code is malicious."
