      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which registers an atexit handler function that executes upon program exit. This handler collects sensitive system information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the script's directory (percent-encoded). It then encodes this combined information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://kotko.me) with a constructed query parameter. This exfiltration of system fingerprinting data to an untrusted external server without user consent is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. The obfuscated variable names and embedding of this network communication in the package installation process (setup.py) further indicate a supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes automatically during package installation. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no user interaction or notification, and the external domain is unrelated to any known benign service. These factors combined classify the code as malicious."

It then encodes this combined information in Base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://kotko.me) with a query parameter named ':bravado-decorators'. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: it performs environment discovery and data encoding, then exfiltrates this data to an external, non-standard domain without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated variable names and the lack of legitimate application logic around the network activity further support the conclusion that this code is designed for covert data exfiltration, a hallmark of malicious behavior."
