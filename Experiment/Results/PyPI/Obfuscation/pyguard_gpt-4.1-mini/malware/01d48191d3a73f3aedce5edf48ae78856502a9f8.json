      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the installation process to execute an asynchronous function during package installation. This function collects the system's hostname and IP address and sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. The webhook URL is external and unrelated to any legitimate package functionality, indicating data exfiltration. The code is obfuscated with meaningless class and function names, and the network communication is embedded directly in the install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of legitimate application logic, combined with the immediate outbound transmission of system information during installation, strongly indicates malicious intent."
