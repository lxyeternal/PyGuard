      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden process, which suggests conditional execution to evade analysis or target specific environments. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs outside of any legitimate user interaction or consent, and is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code attempts to run a standard setup() call but is overshadowed by the hidden execution of the encoded PowerShell command. These patterns align with critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload delivery, execution during package installation, and lack of error handling, all of which are hallmark signs of malware."
