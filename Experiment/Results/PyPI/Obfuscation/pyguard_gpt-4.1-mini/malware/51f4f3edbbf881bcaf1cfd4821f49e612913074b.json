      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method (KSloWDvFyFDPRwxjkYJOyVUpBYsrtSWE) that is presumably intended to run during installation. Inside this method, it imports network-related libraries (aiohttp, socket, requests, discord.SyncWebhook), collects the local hostname and IP address, and sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation without user consent or notification. The use of a hardcoded external webhook URL for sending system information during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it leaks potentially sensitive host data to an attacker-controlled endpoint. Additionally, the obfuscated class and method names, the embedding of this code in the install command hook, and the lack of legitimate application logic around the network activity further support the conclusion that this code is malicious. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attack vectors where malicious code executes during package installation to exfiltrate system information stealthily."
