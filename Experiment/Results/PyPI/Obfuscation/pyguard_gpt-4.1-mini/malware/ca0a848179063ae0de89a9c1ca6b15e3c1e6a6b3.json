      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The function XZWmkWQqccpVwsAZXayCndGAMyDuWsEK() checks for the existence of a specific file (/tmp/test1563.txt) and if absent, creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (59.110.111.85) on port 8088. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr using os.dup2, and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) connected to this socket. This sequence is a classic reverse shell payload, enabling remote command execution and control of the victim machine without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated function and variable names, lack of legitimate application logic, and execution of shell commands during package setup further confirm malicious intent. The initial creation of the /tmp/test1563.txt file by the other function appears to be a marker or persistence check to avoid repeated infection or detection. Overall, this code is a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor embedded in a Python package installation script, representing a critical security risk."
