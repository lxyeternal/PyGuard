      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install and overrides an install-related method to send system information (hostname and IP address) to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL during package installation. This behavior occurs without user interaction or consent, embedded in the package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL for exfiltration of system information (hostname and IP) is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest an attempt to hide the malicious behavior. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic around the network activity and directly sends sensitive environment data externally. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including data exfiltration during install, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, obfuscation, and lack of user consent."
