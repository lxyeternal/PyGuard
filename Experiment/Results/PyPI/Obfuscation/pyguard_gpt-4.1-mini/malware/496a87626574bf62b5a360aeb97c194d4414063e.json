      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during install time strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern is a known supply chain attack vector where malicious code is hidden inside the setup/install scripts of a package to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) further suggests potential for remote code fetching or data exfiltration, although the exact decrypted payload is not shown. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated code, encrypted payload execution at install time, and use of dynamic code execution (exec) without user consent."
