      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method (with an obfuscated name) to execute a subprocess call during package installation. This subprocess call runs a Python command that imports a module named 'ptmpl.post_install' and calls its 'download_and_run_script()' function. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated class and method names, combined with executing code from an imported module during installation, strongly indicate malicious intent. The code triggers remote code execution during package installation, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware. There is no indication of user notification, validation, or safe update mechanisms. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh) directly into the user's home directory without any validation or user consent. It then sets executable permissions on this script and executes it with bash, passing arguments that suggest restoration and local path usage. Additionally, it runs system commands to update package lists and install tmux without user interaction. The function and variable names are obfuscated, and the code performs network retrieval and immediate execution of potentially untrusted code. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote payload retrieval, local persistence setup, execution of downloaded code without validation, use of suspicious hardcoded URLs, and lack of user consent or notification. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior."
