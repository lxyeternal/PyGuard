      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it executes a shell command ('whoami') via subprocess to get the current username, then sends this username along with the package name to a hardcoded external URL ('https://vigneshsb.me/test.php') via an HTTP POST request without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class and method names, the execution of shell commands during install, and the immediate network communication to a suspicious external domain strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this behavior, making it a high-risk malicious pattern."
