      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, it asynchronously imports discord webhook and aiohttp modules, then creates a Discord webhook client using a hardcoded webhook URL. It collects the system's hostname and IP address via socket calls and sends this information to the attacker's Discord webhook without any user consent or interaction. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data exfiltration of system information during package installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class and method names, embedding network communication in the install command, and sending sensitive environment data to a hardcoded external endpoint (Discord webhook) are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data exfiltration, and the code triggers automatically on package installation, making it a high-risk malicious payload."
