      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens silently without user interaction or consent, and exceptions are suppressed, further indicating stealth. The use of such hidden, encoded PowerShell commands in a setup script context is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a benign-looking setup call, likely to disguise the malicious intent within a package installation script. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy, obfuscated payload execution during package installation."
