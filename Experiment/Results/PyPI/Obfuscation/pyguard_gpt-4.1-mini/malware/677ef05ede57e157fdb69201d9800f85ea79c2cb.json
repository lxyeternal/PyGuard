      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens immediately upon running the script, without any user interaction or consent, and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, increasing stealth. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspicious package metadata, which may be a decoy or to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, these behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealthy hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all without user consent or transparency."
