      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The script conditionally installs a Windows-specific package (pypiwin32) if missing, then proceeds to create a hidden directory under the user's APPDATA path named 'Extension'. It writes obfuscated JavaScript code (background.js) and a manifest.json file into this directory, effectively creating a Chrome extension that runs a background script. The JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and repeatedly manipulates the clipboard by creating a hidden textarea, focusing it, and replacing clipboard content with attacker-controlled values that match cryptocurrency address patterns. This behavior is consistent with clipboard hijacking malware aimed at stealing or redirecting cryptocurrency transactions. Furthermore, the script enumerates Windows shortcut (.lnk) files in multiple user and system startup-related directories, including the Start Menu, Quick Launch TaskBar, and Desktop. For shortcuts targeting popular browsers (chrome.exe, msedge.exe, brave.exe, launcher.exe), it modifies their command-line arguments to load the malicious extension from the APPDATA path, thereby achieving persistence and automatic execution of the malicious payload whenever the browser is launched. The script also checks for administrative privileges to add persistence in the system-wide Start Menu folder. The combination of obfuscated payload, clipboard hijacking, stealthy persistence via browser extension injection, and execution triggered during package installation strongly aligns with known malware patterns and supply chain attack techniques. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent involved, and the code suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating malicious intent."
