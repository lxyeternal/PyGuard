      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects environment variables and encodes them in base64, then sends this encoded data along with the current username and IP address to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eo6sl0hu84cr4pa.m.pipedream.net). This is done without any user interaction or consent, indicating data exfiltration. The variable names are obfuscated, and the code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The code also prints a misleading message claiming to be a security package while actually compromising the machine by sending sensitive environment information externally. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain for data exfiltration, combined with environment discovery and outbound network communication during package setup, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
