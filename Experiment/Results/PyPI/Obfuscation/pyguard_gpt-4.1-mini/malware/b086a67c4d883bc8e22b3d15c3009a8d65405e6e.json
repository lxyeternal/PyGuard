      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('syswin32.exe') from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL ('https://tryg.ga/syswin32.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.run with shell=True and the 'start' command, which launches the executable on Windows. This behavior is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and execution, commonly used in malware for initial infection or payload delivery. The code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before downloading and running the executable, increasing the risk of system compromise. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain and the direct execution of a downloaded binary without transparency or legitimate application logic strongly indicate malicious intent."
