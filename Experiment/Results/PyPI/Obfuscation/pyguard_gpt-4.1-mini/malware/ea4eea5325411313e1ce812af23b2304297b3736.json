      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects sensitive data such as Discord tokens, user credentials, cookies, and other personal information from various installed browsers and applications by accessing local files and decrypting stored secrets using Windows DPAPI. The code then exfiltrates this stolen data to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and external URLs, including suspicious domains and services like 000webhostapp.com and gofile.io. It uses obfuscated variable and function names, base64 decoding, and Windows API calls to hide its intent and decrypt protected data. The code also forcibly kills processes related to browsers or wallets to access locked files, compresses stolen data into zip archives, uploads them to external servers, and sends notifications via Discord webhooks. It performs these actions without any user interaction or consent, runs multiple threads for stealth and efficiency, and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The presence of hardcoded webhook URLs, encrypted payloads, environment variable harvesting, and automated data exfiltration confirms that this code is a credential and token stealer designed to compromise user accounts and privacy. Therefore, this code is definitively malicious."
