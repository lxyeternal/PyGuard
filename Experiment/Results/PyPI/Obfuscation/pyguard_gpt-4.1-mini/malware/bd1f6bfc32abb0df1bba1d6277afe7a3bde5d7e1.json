      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides an install method to execute a shell command during package installation. Specifically, it runs a curl command to silently fetch a script from a hardcoded IP address (http://34.69.215.243/hi) and pipes it directly to bash for execution, suppressing all output and errors. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling remote code execution without user consent or interaction. The use of a hardcoded IP address instead of a domain, obfuscated class and method names, and execution of a remote script during installation are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, and potential further payload delivery. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity and shell execution, confirming it as malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a custom SSH server using the Paramiko library that listens on TCP port 2222 and accepts any username and password combination without validation, printing the credentials to the console. It then opens an interactive shell channel that echoes back any input received but does not execute any commands. This behavior effectively creates a backdoor SSH server that can be accessed remotely with any credentials, allowing an attacker to connect and interact with the server. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, which is a common tactic to hinder analysis. The server accepts connections indefinitely and spawns a new thread for each connection, enabling persistent unauthorized access. Although it does not execute shell commands or exfiltrate data directly, the presence of an unauthenticated SSH server listening on a non-standard port with no access control is a significant security risk and characteristic of malicious backdoor or remote access trojan (RAT) behavior."
