      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the lack of any legitimate application logic or user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code is a standard setup call with no suspicious behavior, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution in the installation context is a critical risk indicator of malware."
