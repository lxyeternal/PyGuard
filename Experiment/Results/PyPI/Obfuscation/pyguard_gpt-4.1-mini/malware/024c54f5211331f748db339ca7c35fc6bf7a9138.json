      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to locate and read Discord and various browser local storage leveldb files from user directories, searching for Discord tokens using regex patterns. It then validates these tokens by making API requests to Discord endpoints. Valid tokens are collected and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (fetched from 'https://rentry.co/23azs/raw'), which is likely a Discord webhook or attacker-controlled endpoint. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to hide its intent. It performs these actions in background threads without user consent or interaction. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, token harvesting from local storage, token validation, and exfiltration to an external server are classic hallmarks of credential stealing malware. Additionally, the code suppresses exceptions and uses threading to evade detection. The overall behavior is consistent with a Discord token stealer that exfiltrates sensitive authentication tokens to an attacker-controlled server."
