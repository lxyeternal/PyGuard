      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It fetches URLs from suspicious external sources (pastebin.com raw content and utilities.tk) without user consent or validation. It sends HTTP POST requests to a URL dynamically retrieved from a remote source, likely exfiltrating data (e.g., sending a message payload and the local directory path). It writes a randomly named Python script file (.pyw) with content downloaded from an untrusted URL and immediately executes it via subprocess.Popen without any validation or user interaction. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code during package setup is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling arbitrary code execution. The use of obfuscated or non-standard header names (csSZLcNODzZkDVmhWXEnqDMNKZZCtBma) and the absence of error handling around network and execution calls further increase suspicion. The code runs automatically during the setup process, which can lead to silent compromise of the host system. These behaviors align with critical risk patterns such as remote payload retrieval, dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, and execution of untrusted code during package installation, all hallmark signs of malware."
