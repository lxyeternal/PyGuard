      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses the setuptools install command to register a function (tWrwWUyGUQedmPMPTlATFRuFrCvAJAoD) that executes at exit during installation. This function writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with the content 'proof bug by kotko' without user consent, which is suspicious. It then collects sensitive environment information: the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current file's directory (percent-encoded). This data is concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with a query parameter constructed from obfuscated variables. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded suspicious external URLs, automatic data collection and exfiltration during package installation without user interaction, and encoding of system information before transmission are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment fingerprinting, data exfiltration, obfuscation, and execution of code during package installation (a known supply chain attack vector). Therefore, this code is malicious."
