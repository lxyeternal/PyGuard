      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The use of subprocess with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspicious package metadata but no legitimate logic, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a package installation script. These patterns match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and lack of user interaction or consent."
