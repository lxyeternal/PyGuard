      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It embeds a reverse shell payload inside a string variable that is written to a Python script file named 'remote-access.py' in the user's home or Documents directory during package installation. This payload attempts to connect back to a hardcoded external IP address (120.76.194.25) on port 20080 and, upon connection, spawns an interactive shell (cmd.exe on Windows or /bin/bash on Linux) that is bridged over the socket, effectively providing remote control of the victim machine. The reverse shell code uses threading to handle bidirectional communication between the socket and the shell process, which is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) behavior. The malicious code is triggered automatically during the installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the install method to write and execute the reverse shell script without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded IP, writing executable code to user directories, and spawning subprocesses for shell access are all hallmark signs of malware. This is a supply chain attack vector where the malicious payload is delivered and executed during package installation, enabling unauthorized remote access and control of the infected system."
