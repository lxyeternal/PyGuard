      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and executes the decoded payload via exec(). The decoded payload itself is extremely large and appears to be further obfuscated or encrypted, which is a common tactic to evade static analysis. The use of exec() on decoded base64 data is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it allows the execution of hidden or dynamically generated malicious payloads. The code lacks any user interaction, logging, or legitimate application logic, and the obfuscation level is excessive for benign purposes. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
