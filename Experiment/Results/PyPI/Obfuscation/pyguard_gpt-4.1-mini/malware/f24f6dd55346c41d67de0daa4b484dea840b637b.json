      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a lambda function that dynamically imports 'marshal', 'zlib', and 'base64' modules to decode, decompress, and deserialize a large obfuscated payload. It then immediately executes this payload using exec(). This pattern of reversing a base64-encoded, compressed, and marshaled byte string and executing it dynamically is a classic and strong indicator of malicious intent. Such obfuscation is used to hide the true behavior of the code, evade static analysis, and execute arbitrary code without user consent or interaction. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the use of exec on decoded data, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution from obfuscated payloads, a hallmark of supply chain attacks, remote code execution, and payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is a classic example of obfuscated malicious Python code. It uses multiple layers of obfuscation: the input string is reversed, then base64 decoded, then decompressed with zlib, and finally unmarshalled using the marshal module. The resulting code is executed dynamically with exec(). This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent because it hides the actual payload from static analysis and human inspection. Such obfuscation is commonly used by malware to evade detection and to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system without consent. The use of marshal.loads on decompressed and decoded data followed by exec is a hallmark of malware delivery and execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

It then immediately executes the decoded payload using exec(). This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious code designed to evade static analysis and hide its intent. The use of marshal to load bytecode, combined with reversed base64 strings and compressed data, strongly indicates an attempt to conceal arbitrary code execution. Such behavior is exclusively observed in malware samples and is a critical risk indicator. The code likely executes hidden or unauthorized actions on the host system without user consent, which is characteristic of malware, including potential payload delivery, persistence, or data exfiltration. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
