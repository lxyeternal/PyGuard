      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious file ('hifromDreamyOak') and exits if present, indicating evasion or environment detection. It imports the 'requests' module to perform network operations without user consent. The core payload is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed dynamically via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. The decoded payload performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious URL (a Discord CDN link), retrieves content, writes it to a temporary file, and executes it via subprocess.call. This sequence is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and execution, enabling attackers to run arbitrary code on the victim's machine. The obfuscation of variable names and the use of base64 encoding further hide the intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying these actions. Overall, this code is designed to download and execute potentially malicious code during package installation, representing a high-risk supply chain attack vector."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to a temporary file with a non-descriptive, obfuscated variable name and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables remote code execution of potentially untrusted and harmful payloads. The absence of error handling, logging, or user notification further increases suspicion. The use of a hardcoded URL pointing to an executable file and the immediate execution of that file without validation or sandboxing is a strong hallmark of malware or malicious scripts designed to deliver and run payloads on the victim's system."
