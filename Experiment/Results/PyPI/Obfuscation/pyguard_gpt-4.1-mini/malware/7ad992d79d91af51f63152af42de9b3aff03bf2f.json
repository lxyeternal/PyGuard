      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install process to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it retrieves the current system username using os.getlogin(), constructs a URL with a hardcoded suspicious IP address (194.233.164.169) and the username, and sends an HTTP GET request to that URL. This behavior is indicative of environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. The code is obfuscated with meaningless variable and function names, and the network communication is embedded in the install hook, which is a common supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network call during installation, and the use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a domain associated with the package or author is suspicious. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
