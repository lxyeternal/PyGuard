      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method to execute a base64-encoded shell command during package installation. The shell command creates a reverse shell by opening a TCP connection to a hardcoded IP address (81.68.90.93) on port 4444, duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, disables shell history, and spawns an interactive bash shell. The command is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, then executed via os.system without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell payload, enabling unauthorized remote control of the victim's system. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hardcoded suspicious IP, execution during package installation, and spawning a shell with redirected file descriptors are all strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware."
