      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method to perform network and execution actions during package installation without user consent. It downloads an executable file named 'CBLines.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL on GitHub (https://github.com/holdthatcode/e/raw/main/CBLines.exe) using a PowerShell Invoke-WebRequest command. After successful download, it immediately executes the downloaded executable using PowerShell Start-Process. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The code uses obfuscated class and method names, lacks any validation or user notification, and performs these actions silently during install. The use of subprocess calls to run PowerShell commands to download and execute an external executable without integrity checks or user interaction is a strong indicator of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, downloading and running untrusted code, obfuscation, and abuse of the installation process for code execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
