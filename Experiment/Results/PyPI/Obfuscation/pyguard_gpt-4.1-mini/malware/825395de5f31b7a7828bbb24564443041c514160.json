      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method to execute a shell command during package installation. The shell command is a reverse shell payload that attempts to connect to a hardcoded remote host 'e6j4342057.zicp.fun' on port 26264, duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, disables shell history, and spawns a bash shell. The payload is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, then executed via os.system. This pattern is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell behavior, enabling unauthorized remote control of the victim system. The execution occurs automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hardcoded suspicious domain, and execution of a reverse shell in an install hook are strong indicators of malicious intent."
