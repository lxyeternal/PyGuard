      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/jagermager999/8746465cdg78cdsxasy8a/raw/main/test.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable to a temporary file with an obfuscated name ('tmp_file_pypi_29x7d0kf8.exe') and immediately executes it using os.system. After execution, it deletes the temporary file, indicating self-deleting behavior to evade detection. This download-and-execute pattern is triggered automatically during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The function and variable names are obfuscated, and there is no validation or integrity check on the downloaded file. The code only runs on Windows platforms and quits otherwise, showing targeted behavior. These characteristics align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including remote payload retrieval, arbitrary code execution, self-deletion, and execution during package installation without user consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
