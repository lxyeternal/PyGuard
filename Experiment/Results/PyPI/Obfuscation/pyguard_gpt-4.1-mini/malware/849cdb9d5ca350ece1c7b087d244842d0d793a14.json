      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the current username, hostname, and public IP address by querying an external service. It then packages this data along with Python version and timestamp into a JSON payload and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://123.206.22.33:5000/p/). This exfiltration of system information occurs immediately upon execution without any user interaction or consent. Furthermore, this data collection and exfiltration is triggered during the package setup process (via setuptools.setup), which means it executes automatically when the package is installed. The use of a hardcoded IP address rather than a legitimate domain, silent exception handling to suppress errors, and the absence of any legitimate application logic around this network activity strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving environment fingerprinting and data exfiltration during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector."
