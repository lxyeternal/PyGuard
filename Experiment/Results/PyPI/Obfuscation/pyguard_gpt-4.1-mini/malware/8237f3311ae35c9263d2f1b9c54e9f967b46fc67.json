      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, it imports network and asynchronous libraries (discord, aiohttp, asyncio, socket) and collects the hostname and IP address of the host machine. It then asynchronously sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of an obfuscated class name, the embedding of network communication in the install command, and the hardcoded external webhook URL for sending potentially sensitive system information strongly indicate malicious intent."
