      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('launcher.exe') from a hardcoded external URL hosted on Discord's CDN, writes it directly to disk without any validation or user consent, executes it immediately using os.system, and then deletes the executable file. This pattern matches a classic malware behavior of remote payload retrieval and execution, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The absence of any user interaction, validation, or legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity, combined with the immediate execution of a downloaded binary, aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution from untrusted remote sources, self-deleting behavior (anti-forensics), and use of hardcoded suspicious URLs. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
