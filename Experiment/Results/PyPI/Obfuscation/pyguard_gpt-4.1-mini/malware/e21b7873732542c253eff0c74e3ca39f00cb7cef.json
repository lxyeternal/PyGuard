      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects extensive system information including hostname, logged-in username, contents of /etc/passwd (on Linux/macOS), OS details, current directory, and directory listings without any user interaction or consent. It then encodes this sensitive data and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://rk8xxqzdug.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Test/response). This behavior is a classic example of information stealing and data exfiltration. Furthermore, this data collection and exfiltration occurs immediately during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The variable names are obfuscated, and there is no legitimate application logic justifying this network activity. The use of os.popen to execute shell commands to gather sensitive system data, combined with immediate transmission to an external endpoint, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including unsolicited collection and exfiltration of sensitive system information during package installation without user consent."
