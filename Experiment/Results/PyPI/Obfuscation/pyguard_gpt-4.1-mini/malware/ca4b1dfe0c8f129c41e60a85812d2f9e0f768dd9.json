      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The subprocess.Popen call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens during the import or setup phase, which can be triggered during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, conditional directory checks, and execution during setup strongly aligns with multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including remote code execution, stealthy payload deployment, and supply chain attack techniques."
