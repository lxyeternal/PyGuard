      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is highly obfuscated and contains multiple layers of base64-encoded and compressed payloads that are dynamically decoded and executed. It is embedded within a setup script, which triggers execution during package installation (when 'sdist' is not in argv). The code performs environment inspection, collects system and user information, and sends it to external endpoints. It also downloads and writes executable files to obscure or hidden directories, then executes them, often in a hidden or background manner (e.g., using PowerShell with encoded commands on Windows). The presence of dynamic code execution (exec on decoded data), network communication to suspicious or hardcoded URLs, writing and executing files without user consent, and obfuscation techniques are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
