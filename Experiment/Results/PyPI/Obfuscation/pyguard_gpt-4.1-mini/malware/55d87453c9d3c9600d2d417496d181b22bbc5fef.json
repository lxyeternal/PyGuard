      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This means arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector. The code also specifies setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this malicious purpose. The encrypted payload is not visible in plaintext, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: arbitrary code execution during install, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of decrypted code. Therefore, this code is malicious."
