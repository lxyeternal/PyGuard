      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the login username, hostname, platform details, and local IP address. It then encodes this information using base64 with a custom prefix and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://127.70.159.15:60006) without any user interaction or consent. This exfiltration of system fingerprinting data to a non-standard, hardcoded IP address is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. Furthermore, this data exfiltration occurs immediately upon package installation (triggered in the setup script), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated function and variable names, silent exception handling, and the use of a non-standard IP address for data transmission further reinforce the malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network activity, and the code is embedded in the package setup process, enabling remote data exfiltration during installation without user awareness."
