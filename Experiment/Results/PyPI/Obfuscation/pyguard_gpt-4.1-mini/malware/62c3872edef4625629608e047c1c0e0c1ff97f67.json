      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides a method to execute encrypted and obfuscated code during package installation. Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules dynamically only if the OS is Windows ('nt'), then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key, and executes the decrypted code with exec(). This behavior occurs during the install phase of the package setup, which means arbitrary code execution happens without user consent when the package is installed. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, dynamic imports, and execution of decrypted code during installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious Python packages. The code also requires 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup dependencies, which are used solely for this malicious payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the payload is hidden behind encryption to evade detection. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of network-related modules for potential further malicious activity."
