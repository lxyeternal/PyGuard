      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses the setuptools install command to register a function (RiKYBbRvcbNMVacHQXIFWUgNeOqakfeK) that executes at exit during installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. This function writes a suspicious file 'pocbykotko.txt' with arbitrary content, then collects sensitive environment information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current file's directory. It encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with a constructed query parameter. The use of obfuscated variable names, absence of user consent or notification, and the exfiltration of system-specific data to an external, non-standard domain during package installation are hallmark signs of malicious activity. This behavior aligns with known patterns of information-stealing malware embedded in Python package installation scripts, constituting a high-risk supply chain attack and data exfiltration threat."
