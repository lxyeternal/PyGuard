      "malicious_behavior": "The code reads the entire contents of the sensitive system file '/etc/passwd', which contains user account information, and concatenates all lines into a single string. It then base64-encodes this data and URL-encodes it as a parameter named 'data'. Immediately after, it sends this encoded sensitive information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL 'https://webhook.site/67e7e084-1921-442f-99fe-ba234f471b4e' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of data exfiltration, where sensitive system information is covertly sent to an attacker-controlled endpoint. The use of obfuscation in variable names and the embedding of this exfiltration code within a setup.py installation script further indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent and execute this code during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The silent exception handling around the network request suppresses errors, increasing stealth. These factors collectively confirm that the code contains malicious behavior."
