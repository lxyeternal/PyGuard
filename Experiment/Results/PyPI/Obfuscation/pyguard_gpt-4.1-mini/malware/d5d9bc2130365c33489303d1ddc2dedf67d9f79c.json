      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is obfuscated and uses a long, encoded string 'wopvEaTEcopFEavc' and a numeric key string 'iOpvEoeaaeavocp' to reconstruct a Python code string by XORing each character of the encoded string with a character from the key string. This reconstructed code is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). The use of obfuscation, dynamic decoding, and immediate execution of the decoded payload is a classic hallmark of malicious code. Such techniques are commonly used to hide the true intent of the code, evade static analysis, and execute arbitrary or harmful payloads without user consent or visibility. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the obfuscation and dynamic execution, strongly indicates that this code contains malicious behavior."
