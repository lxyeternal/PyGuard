      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and wallet information by accessing local application data directories and decrypting stored credentials using Windows DPAPI. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to hide its intent. It exfiltrates the stolen data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests without any user consent or interaction. It dynamically installs required modules if missing, suppresses exceptions to avoid detection, and uses threading to perform concurrent data collection and exfiltration. The code also constructs and sends detailed user environment and credential information, including IP address, username, and Discord user metadata, to the attacker's server. It creates temporary files, zips sensitive directories, and uploads them to external file hosting services, then sends the download links to the attacker. The presence of cryptographic decryption of stored passwords and tokens, combined with network exfiltration to a suspicious hardcoded webhook, confirms the code is designed to steal credentials and sensitive information stealthily. These behaviors align with known patterns of malware, specifically Discord token stealers and browser credential stealers, making this code malicious."
