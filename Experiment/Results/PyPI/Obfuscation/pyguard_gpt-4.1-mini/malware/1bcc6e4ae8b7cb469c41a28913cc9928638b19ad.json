      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or consent, saves it locally as 'download.exe', and immediately executes it using os.startfile. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior because it fetches and runs potentially untrusted code from the internet silently. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network and execution activity. The use of a hardcoded URL pointing to an executable file and immediate execution without safeguards strongly suggests a remote payload retrieval and execution attack vector, which is a foundational step in many malware infection chains."
