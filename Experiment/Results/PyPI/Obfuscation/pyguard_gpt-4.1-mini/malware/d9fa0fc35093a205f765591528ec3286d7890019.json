      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive system information such as the current username, hostname, and public IP address by querying an external service. It then constructs a JSON payload containing this data along with Python version and a hardcoded package name. This data is sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external IP address (http://123.206.22.33:5000/p/), which is not a known legitimate or trusted endpoint. The code writes a file with a hashed hostname name in the system's temporary directory to ensure the data exfiltration happens only once per host. This exfiltration occurs silently without user consent or notification. Furthermore, this data collection and exfiltration is triggered immediately upon package installation via setuptools.setup, embedding the behavior in the installation process, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address, lack of legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity, silent exception handling, and execution during package installation are strong indicators of malicious intent. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized data exfiltration and is malicious."
