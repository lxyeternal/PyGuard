      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using character code escapes, dynamic eval calls, and multiple layers of decoding. It dynamically imports critical built-in functions like eval, compile, exec, base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and string operations through obfuscated means. The code defines functions that decode and transform data, and then executes the decoded data dynamically. The presence of large base64-encoded and compressed byte strings that are decoded and then executed via eval or exec is a classic hallmark of malicious code designed to hide its true intent and evade static analysis. The code also uses indirect dynamic imports and decoding of data that is then executed, which is a strong indicator of arbitrary code execution from obfuscated payloads. Such patterns are consistently associated with malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise. There is no indication of legitimate application logic, user interaction, or safe handling of the decoded content. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
