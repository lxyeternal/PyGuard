      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The script conditionally installs a Windows-specific package (pypiwin32) if missing, then proceeds to create a hidden directory under the user's APPDATA folder named 'Extension'. It writes obfuscated JavaScript code (background.js) and a manifest.json file into this directory, effectively creating a Chrome extension that runs a background script. The JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and repeatedly manipulates the clipboard by creating a hidden textarea, focusing it, selecting its content, and executing copy commands. It replaces clipboard content matching cryptocurrency address patterns with attacker-controlled addresses, indicating clipboard hijacking aimed at stealing cryptocurrency transactions. The script then enumerates Windows shortcut (.lnk) files in multiple user and system startup-related directories, including the Start Menu, Quick Launch TaskBar, and Desktop. For shortcuts targeting popular browsers (chrome.exe, msedge.exe, brave.exe, launcher.exe), it modifies their command-line arguments to load the malicious extension from the APPDATA path, ensuring persistence and automatic execution of the malicious payload whenever the browser is launched. The code also checks for administrative privileges to add a system-wide startup path for persistence. The combination of obfuscated payload, clipboard hijacking targeting cryptocurrency addresses, stealthy persistence via browser extension injection, and execution triggered during package installation strongly aligns with known malware patterns and supply chain attack techniques. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent, and the behavior is designed to evade detection and maintain persistence on the victim's system."
