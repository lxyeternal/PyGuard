      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method that is called during package installation. Inside this method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses the Fernet cryptography library with a hardcoded key to decrypt a large encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is then executed immediately via exec(). This means that arbitrary code, hidden inside the encrypted blob, is executed during the installation of this package without user consent or interaction. This is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious code is embedded in the setup/install process of a Python package. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, dynamic import of network and cryptography libraries, and execution of decrypted code at install time are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code also specifies setup_requires=['fernet', 'requests'], which are used only for this malicious payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the payload is executed silently during installation. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious."
