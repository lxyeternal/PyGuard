      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The presence of try-except blocks suppressing all exceptions hides errors and avoids raising suspicion. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload delivery, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
