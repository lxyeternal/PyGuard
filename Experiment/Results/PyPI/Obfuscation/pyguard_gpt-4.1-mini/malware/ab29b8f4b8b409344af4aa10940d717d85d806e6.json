      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a hardcoded PowerShell reverse shell command. Specifically, during installation, it runs a PowerShell command that creates a TCP client connecting to the IP address 81.68.184.99 on port 6784, then opens a stream to receive and execute commands remotely, effectively establishing a reverse shell. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling unauthorized remote control of the victim's machine without user consent. The code uses obfuscated class and method names, embeds the malicious payload in the install hook (a common supply chain attack vector), and executes the payload silently during package installation. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the hardcoded IP and port are suspicious and unrelated to any benign use. This pattern is a critical risk indicator of malicious activity, consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors."
