      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It begins by installing a large number of packages via os.system('pip install ...'), which is unusual and suspicious for a script without user interaction or consent. The code then imports many modules commonly used in malware for system interaction, cryptography, clipboard access, and network communication. Most critically, it contains an obfuscated payload: a large gzip-compressed, marshal-serialized byte string that is decompressed and executed dynamically via exec(marshal.loads(gzip.decompress(...))). This pattern is a hallmark of malware, as it hides the true payload and enables arbitrary code execution, bypassing static analysis and detection. The use of win32crypt.CryptUnprotectData suggests potential credential theft or decryption of protected data. The combination of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, cryptographic operations, clipboard access, and network libraries strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for information stealing, persistence, or remote control. There is no legitimate application logic, user interaction, or error handling to justify these actions. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
