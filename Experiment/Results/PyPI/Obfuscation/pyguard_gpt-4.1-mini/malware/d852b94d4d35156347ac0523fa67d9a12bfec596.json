      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom setuptools install command (AfterInstall) that, upon package installation, collects all environment variables (os.environ), encodes them in Base64, and sends them via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eow8fqyd1emg87l.m.pipedream.net/). This exfiltration of potentially sensitive environment data during installation without user consent is a classic indicator of malware. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded external domain for data exfiltration, embedding this behavior in the install hook (which runs automatically during package installation), and the absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction around this network activity strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as data exfiltration during install, use of obfuscated data transmission (Base64 encoding), and use of suspicious external endpoints. Therefore, this code is malicious."
