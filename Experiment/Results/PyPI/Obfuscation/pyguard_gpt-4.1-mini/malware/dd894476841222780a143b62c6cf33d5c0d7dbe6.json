      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects sensitive authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) without user consent. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, gathers detailed user information from Roblox APIs, including UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, creation date, and user profile data. It also fetches the public IP address of the victim's machine. All this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions silently, which are common evasion techniques. There is no user interaction or legitimate business logic justifying this data collection and exfiltration. The presence of hardcoded external webhook URL combined with exfiltration of authentication tokens and personal data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, consistent with credential theft and information-stealing malware."
