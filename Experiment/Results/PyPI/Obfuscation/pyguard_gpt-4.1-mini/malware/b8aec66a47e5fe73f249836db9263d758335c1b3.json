      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, it executes an asynchronous function that collects the system's hostname and IP address and sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. This behavior occurs silently during package installation without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of an obscure class name and method name, embedding network communication in the install hook, and sending system information to an external, hardcoded webhook are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data exfiltration during installation. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information stealing and unauthorized data exfiltration triggered by package installation."
