      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install process and execute hidden malicious code during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, in the overridden method KwetFkWtKFEovjkMEnLxbRFIBHyqxtPj, it checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, encrypted payload, and execution during install time strongly indicate malicious intent. The code also declares setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only for this hidden payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and execution of decrypted code, all hallmark signs of malware and supply chain attacks."
