      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It uses obfuscated variable and function names to hide intent, imports cryptographic and network libraries (requests, Crypto.Cipher.AES), and contains hardcoded suspicious URLs, including a Discord webhook URL used for exfiltration. The code attempts to install missing dependencies silently, suppresses exceptions, and performs environment discovery by accessing environment variables like LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, and TEMP. It reads sensitive data such as browser cookies, login data, Discord tokens, and wallet information from various user directories, decrypts them using Windows DPAPI, and exfiltrates this data to the hardcoded webhook URL. The code uses threading to perform these actions concurrently and includes functions to upload stolen files and tokens. It also kills certain processes (e.g., browsers, wallets) to access locked files, zips stolen data, and sends it to the attacker-controlled endpoint. The entire operation is triggered automatically without user consent or interaction, embedded in a setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of obfuscated code, encrypted payload handling, hardcoded external endpoints, and automated credential and token theft confirms that this code is malicious."
