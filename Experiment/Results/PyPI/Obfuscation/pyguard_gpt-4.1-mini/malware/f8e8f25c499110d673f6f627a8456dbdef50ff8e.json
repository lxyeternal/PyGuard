      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary file containing a Python command that fetches and executes code directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/pq3s7/raw) without any validation or user consent. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system shell command that runs the Python interpreter in windowed mode. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code at install time via a setup script—is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The obfuscated variable names, lack of error handling, and execution of arbitrary remote code during package installation further confirm the malicious intent."
