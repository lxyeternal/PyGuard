      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a base64-decoded shell command that performs a curl request to a hardcoded internal IP address (http://192.168.1.34:8000/rev.sh) and pipes the result directly to bash for execution. This command is executed automatically during the package installation process via the AfterInstall class's run method, which calls notmalfunc(). This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is fetched from a remote server and executed without user consent during package installation. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, the hardcoded suspicious IP address, the execution of a shell command via os.system, and the triggering of this behavior in the install hook all strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior, and it matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, obfuscation, and execution during package installation."
