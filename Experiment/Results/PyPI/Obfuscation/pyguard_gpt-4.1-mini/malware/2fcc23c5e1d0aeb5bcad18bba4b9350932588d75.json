      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is base64-encoded and then executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and potential malicious intent. Upon decoding, the code dynamically constructs a URL from a list of character codes, which is suspicious and typical of malware trying to hide its network endpoints. It then performs an HTTP GET request to this constructed URL, which appears to be an external, non-standard domain. The code generates a random filename in the user's home directory and writes the content retrieved from the URL to this file. Finally, it executes the downloaded file using a shell command in the same directory. This sequence—obfuscated URL construction, downloading an executable payload from an external source, writing it to disk without validation, and executing it—is a classic pattern of malware behavior, often used for remote code execution, payload delivery, and persistence. There is no user interaction, no validation, and no legitimate application logic surrounding these actions. These factors collectively indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
