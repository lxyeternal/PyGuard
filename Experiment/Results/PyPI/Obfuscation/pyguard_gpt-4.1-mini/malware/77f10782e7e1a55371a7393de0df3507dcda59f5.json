      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The script conditionally installs a Windows-specific extension by writing obfuscated JavaScript code and a manifest.json file into a hidden directory under the user's APPDATA path. This extension code repeatedly executes a function every second that manipulates the clipboard content by replacing user input with hardcoded cryptocurrency addresses, which is a classic clipboard hijacking technique used to steal cryptocurrency transactions. Furthermore, the script modifies Windows shortcut (.lnk) files on the user's Desktop, Start Menu, and Taskbar to inject command-line arguments that load the malicious extension into popular browsers (chrome.exe, msedge.exe, brave.exe, launcher.exe). This behavior is a persistence mechanism to ensure the malicious extension is loaded whenever the user launches these browsers. The script also checks for administrative privileges to extend its persistence to system-wide locations. The obfuscation of the JavaScript payload and the stealthy modification of user shortcuts without user consent or notification are hallmark signs of malware. These actions enable the attacker to hijack clipboard data, maintain persistence, and potentially steal cryptocurrency funds from the victim. Therefore, this code is malicious."
