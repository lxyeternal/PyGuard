      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class (PostInstallCommand) that overrides the standard installation process to execute additional code during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, it downloads an executable file named 'DigitalPulse.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe') without any user interaction, validation, or notification. After downloading, it immediately executes this file using 'os.system' with the Windows 'start' command, which launches the executable on the victim's machine. This pattern of downloading and executing an external binary during package installation, without user consent or integrity checks, is a classic hallmark of malware. The use of a non-standard, hardcoded URL for fetching an executable, combined with execution triggered automatically on install, strongly suggests a supply chain attack or remote payload delivery. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven action justifying this behavior, and the code lacks error handling or logging, further indicating malicious intent."
