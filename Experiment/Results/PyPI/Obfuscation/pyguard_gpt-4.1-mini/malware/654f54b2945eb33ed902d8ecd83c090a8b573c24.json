      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setuptools install subclass, which triggers execution during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The install subclass collects detailed system information including hostname, current working directory, username, and network interface IP addresses. It enumerates directories on common root paths (c:\\, d:\\, /, /home), likely to gather file system information. This data is encoded (hex encoding of strings and path components) and combined into a constructed domain name that is resolved via DNS lookup, likely as a covert channel or beacon. Finally, it sends a POST request to a suspicious, non-standard external domain ('https://425a2.rt11.ml') with a JSON payload containing the collected system information and directory listings. The code suppresses exceptions silently, uses obfuscated variable and function names, and performs network communication and data exfiltration during installation without user interaction or notification. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as environment fingerprinting, data exfiltration, and command-and-control communication embedded in package installation scripts. Therefore, this code is malicious."
