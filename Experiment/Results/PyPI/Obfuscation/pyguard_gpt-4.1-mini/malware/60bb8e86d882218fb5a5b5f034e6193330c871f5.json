      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only executes the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The subprocess call suppresses the window and runs the command in the background without user consent or interaction. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of distutils setup with no legitimate build or install logic further supports the suspicion. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution, conditional directory existence check, and silent exception handling strongly indicates malicious intent."
