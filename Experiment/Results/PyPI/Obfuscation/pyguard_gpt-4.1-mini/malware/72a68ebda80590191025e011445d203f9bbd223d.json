      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It executes during the package setup process (in setup.py), which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, if the platform is macOS ('darwin'), it runs a function that collects detailed system information by executing shell commands: 'uname -a' (system info), 'id' (user identity), 'pwd' (current directory), and 'ifconfig' (network interfaces). This information is aggregated into a dictionary, serialized to JSON, then base64-encoded. The encoded data is appended to a hardcoded suspicious URL with an IP address (http:/81.70.191.194:14333/start/), and a silent curl command is executed to send this data to the remote server without user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic example of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to a hardcoded external IP, performed automatically during package installation, without user interaction or transparency. The use of obfuscated variable names and execution of shell commands in the setup script further supports malicious intent. Such unsolicited collection and transmission of sensitive system information to an external endpoint is a strong indicator of malware or a backdoor, consistent with multiple critical risk patterns for malicious Python code."
