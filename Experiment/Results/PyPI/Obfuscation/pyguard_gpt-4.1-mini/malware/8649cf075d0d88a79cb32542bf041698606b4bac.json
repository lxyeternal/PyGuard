      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. It is embedded in the package installation process (setup.py) by subclassing setuptools install and develop commands, which triggers execution during package installation without user consent. The code attempts to recursively search for '.env' files on all drives (Windows) or in the user's home directory (non-Windows), reads their contents, and collects all environment variables. It then base64-encodes this sensitive data and attempts to exfiltrate it via HTTP GET requests to a hardcoded suspicious URL (http://bellazik.000webhostapp.com:443). Additionally, it reads the user's SSH private key (~/.ssh/id_rsa), base64-encodes it, and sends it to the same remote server. The use of obfuscated variable names, subprocess calls to 'curl' for data exfiltration, and silent exception handling further indicate attempts to evade detection. The code performs these actions automatically during installation, without user interaction or notification, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. These behaviors—automatic credential and environment variable harvesting, exfiltration to a suspicious external domain, and execution triggered by package installation—are hallmark signs of malicious code."
