      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it embeds a post-install hook in the setup.py script that automatically downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://pulse-jqcdn.com/DigitalPulse.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable directly to disk and immediately executes it using os.system with the Windows 'start' command. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, where arbitrary code is fetched and executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain, silent exception suppression, and execution of a downloaded binary without validation or notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution during install, downloading and running untrusted code, and lack of user consent or validation."
