      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides a method to execute encrypted and obfuscated code during package installation. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a hardcoded ciphertext using a hardcoded Fernet key and executes the decrypted code via exec(). This execution happens conditionally on Windows platforms (os.name == 'nt') during the install phase of the package setup. The use of encrypted payload executed at install time without user consent, combined with obfuscated variable names and the embedding of this behavior in the setuptools install command, is a classic supply chain attack pattern. This allows arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine during package installation, which is a critical security risk. The code also declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this malicious payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the payload is hidden behind encryption to evade detection. All these factors strongly indicate malicious behavior."
