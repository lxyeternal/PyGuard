      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides the install method to execute a reverse shell payload during package installation. It hardcodes an IP address (13.93.28.37) and port (1337) and constructs a Python one-liner that creates a TCP socket connecting back to this IP and port. It duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, disables shell history, and spawns a /bin/bash shell, effectively giving remote shell access to the attacker. The payload is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system with bash. This behavior is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell pattern, executed automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction. The obfuscation of variable and class names, embedding of the payload in the install hook, use of hardcoded suspicious IP and port, base64 encoding to evade detection, and execution of shell commands to spawn a remote shell are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This code enables unauthorized remote control of the victim system and is a high-severity security threat."
