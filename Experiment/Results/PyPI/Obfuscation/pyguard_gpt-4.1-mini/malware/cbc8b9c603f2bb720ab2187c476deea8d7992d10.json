      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell command, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without any user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The use of subprocess with hidden window style and encoded PowerShell commands is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is overshadowed by the suspicious subprocess invocation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy, obfuscated remote code execution and potential payload delivery."
