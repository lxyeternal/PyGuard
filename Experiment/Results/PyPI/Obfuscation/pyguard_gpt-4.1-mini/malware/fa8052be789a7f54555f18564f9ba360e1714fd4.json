      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. It first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware, often used to download or execute further malicious payloads without user consent or visibility. Additionally, this code is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is overshadowed by the suspicious subprocess call. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction surrounding the execution of the hidden PowerShell command, and the obfuscation and stealth techniques strongly indicate malicious intent."
