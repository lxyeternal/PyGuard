      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during installation, creates a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (85.159.212.47) on port 61985. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (stdin, stdout, stderr) and spawns a shell (/bin/sh). This effectively creates a reverse shell back to the attacker's machine, allowing remote command execution without user consent or interaction. The code is embedded in the package installation process (setup.py), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded IP and port, and immediate spawning of a shell over a network socket are classic indicators of malicious behavior, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, making this code highly suspicious and malicious."
