      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The script creates a suspicious hidden directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' without user consent, then downloads two executable files from hardcoded, non-standard URLs hosted on Discord's CDN. These executables are saved into the hidden directory with obfuscated filenames and then immediately executed using os.startfile, which runs the downloaded binaries without any validation or user interaction. The script suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. After execution, it attempts to delete the directory, indicating anti-forensics behavior. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded suspicious URLs, downloading and executing untrusted code, and embedding this behavior in a package setup script collectively confirm that this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a suspicious hidden directory named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK', which is not a standard Windows directory and is likely used to hide malicious files. It then downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, non-standard URL hosted on Discord's CDN ('https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/.../main.exe') without any user interaction or validation. The downloaded file is saved as 'main.exe', moved into the hidden directory with a different name ('XMICNEI.exe'), and immediately executed using os.startfile. This sequence—creating a hidden directory, downloading an executable from an untrusted external source, saving it to a suspicious location, and executing it without user consent—is a classic pattern of malware delivery and execution. There is no error handling, user notification, or validation of the downloaded content, increasing the risk. The use of obfuscated variable names further suggests an attempt to hide intent. Based on these factors and the provided knowledge points, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior."
