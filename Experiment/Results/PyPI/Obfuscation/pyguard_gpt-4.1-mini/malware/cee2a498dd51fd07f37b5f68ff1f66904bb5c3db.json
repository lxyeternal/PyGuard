      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses the setuptools install command to register a function (HCBWuhnGtoOLvxjOeseQsNmpnHxPUdgy) to be executed at program exit (atexit). This function performs several suspicious actions without user consent: it writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with arbitrary content, collects the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://api.ipify.org', retrieves the hostname via os.uname(), and obtains the absolute path of the current file's directory. It then encodes this collected system information (IP, hostname, path) into a base64 string and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain 'https://kotko.org' with a constructed query parameter. The use of obfuscated variable names, the embedding of this data exfiltration in the install command, the lack of user interaction or notification, and the transmission of sensitive environment data to an external, non-standard domain are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as data exfiltration during package installation, obfuscation, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution of network communication without user consent, consistent with supply chain attack vectors and information-stealing malware."
