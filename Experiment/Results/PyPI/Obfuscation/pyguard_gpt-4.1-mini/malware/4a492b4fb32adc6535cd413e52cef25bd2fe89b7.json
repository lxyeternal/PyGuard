      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this hidden command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure environment suitability. The subprocess call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call from distutils.core, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution in the same script strongly suggests malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical for malware to avoid detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution with encoded PowerShell commands, execution during package setup, obfuscation, and lack of user consent, confirming that the code is malicious."
