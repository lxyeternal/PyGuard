      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that reads system uptime and collects detailed system information including OS version, platform, and network interface addresses. It then constructs a socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090 and sends this collected system information without any user interaction or consent. The function is invoked during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the install command, which means the data exfiltration occurs automatically when the package is installed. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, hardcoded IP address for outbound TCP connection, and execution of network communication during installation are classic hallmarks of supply chain attacks and malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, indicating intent to stealthily collect and exfiltrate system information. Therefore, this code is malicious."
