      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. The subprocess call includes the flag subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any window display, further indicating stealth behavior. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with arbitrary package metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package installation script. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with no legitimate application logic or user consent, is a strong indicator of malicious intent."
