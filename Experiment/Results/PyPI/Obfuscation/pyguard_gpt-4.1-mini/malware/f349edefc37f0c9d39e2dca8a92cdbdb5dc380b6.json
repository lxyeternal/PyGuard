      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that decodes to a curl command which performs an HTTP POST request to https://pypi.org with a suspicious Host header 'psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net' and a data payload 'test=$HOME'. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, the execution of this decoded command via os.system without user interaction or validation, and the targeting of a non-standard Host header with a POST request to an external URL are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving obfuscated remote payload retrieval or data exfiltration attempts. The code executes a shell command that sends potentially sensitive environment information ($HOME) to a remote server without user consent or notification, which is a typical characteristic of malicious code."
