      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install process, which is a known vector for malicious code execution during package installation (supply chain attack vector). It collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, current working directory, and username without user consent. It then sends this information via multiple HTTP GET requests to suspicious, hardcoded external domains (e.g., 'https://j0j0.xyz/11cent' and related subdomains), which is indicative of system fingerprinting and potential command-and-control communication. Furthermore, it attempts to read sensitive system files ('/etc/debconf.conf', '/.dockerenv', '/root/.wget-hsts') and exfiltrates their contents via HTTP POST requests to the same suspicious domain. The use of obfuscated class and method names, absence of user interaction or notification, and embedding of this behavior in the installation process strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including data exfiltration, environment reconnaissance, and abuse of the package installation process for unauthorized code execution and information theft."
