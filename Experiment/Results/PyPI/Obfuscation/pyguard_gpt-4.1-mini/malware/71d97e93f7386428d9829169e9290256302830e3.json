      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens without any user interaction or consent, and the subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the code calls setup() from distutils.core with generic metadata, which is likely a decoy or to disguise the malicious intent within a package installation script. The presence of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious behavior, consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms."
