      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It uses a hardcoded, base64-encoded URL that decodes to a Discord webhook URL, which is a common exfiltration endpoint used by malware. The function takes an authorization token and user response data, then makes a GET request to Discord's API to retrieve sensitive billing information associated with the authorization token. It then sends this sensitive information—including the authorization token, username, user ID, email, phone number, operating system, and billing details—to the attacker-controlled Discord webhook via an HTTP POST request. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 encoding to hide the webhook URL, and exfiltration of sensitive user credentials without user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving credential theft and data exfiltration to external, hardcoded endpoints."
