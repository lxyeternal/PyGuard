      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: it is embedded in a setup script which triggers on package installation, downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (a Discord CDN link), writes it to a hidden and unusual system directory (C:\\$Windows.~SXK), renames the downloaded file to a suspicious executable name (XMICNEI.exe), and immediately executes it without any user interaction or validation. This pattern is a classic remote payload retrieval and execution technique commonly used in malware for persistence and system compromise. The use of a non-standard hidden directory, lack of error handling, absence of user consent, and direct execution of a downloaded binary strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a suspicious hidden directory named 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK', which is not a standard Windows directory and is likely used for hiding files. It then downloads an executable file ('main.exe') from a hardcoded external URL hosted on Discord's CDN, which is not a trusted or standard software distribution source. The downloaded file is saved into the hidden directory with a different name ('XMICNEI.exe') and immediately executed using os.startfile without any user interaction, consent, or validation. This pattern—creating hidden directories, downloading executables from hardcoded suspicious URLs, saving them under obscure names, and executing them silently—is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. There is no legitimate application logic, error handling, or user notification, and the behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious activity, including remote payload retrieval, local persistence setup, and arbitrary code execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
