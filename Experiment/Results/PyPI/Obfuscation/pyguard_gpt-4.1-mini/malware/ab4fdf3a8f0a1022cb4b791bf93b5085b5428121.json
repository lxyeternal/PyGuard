      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that executes during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. It performs the following suspicious and malicious actions: 1) It creates directories inside the Windows Start Menu Programs Startup folder and another folder named 'Powerpoint' under the user's AppData Roaming path, which is a common persistence technique to run code on user login. 2) It clones two GitHub repositories from hardcoded URLs into these created directories without user consent or validation. 3) It renames a Python script ('test.py') from the cloned repository into the Startup folder, effectively placing executable code in an autostart location. 4) It immediately executes a binary ('main.exe') from the second cloned repository, which is likely a malicious payload. 5) All these actions happen silently during the package installation process without user interaction or notification. 6) The use of obfuscated class and method names and hardcoded system paths further indicate an attempt to evade detection. These behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including persistence setup, remote payload retrieval, and execution of untrusted code during installation, which are hallmark traits of malicious supply chain attacks."
