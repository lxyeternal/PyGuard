      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script that imports urllib.request and executes code fetched from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/bjhtk/raw) using exec(). This is done without any user interaction or validation, which is a critical red flag. Then, it attempts to execute this temporary file using a system shell command that runs the Python interpreter in windowed mode (replacing '.exe' with 'w.exe'), which is a known technique to run code stealthily on Windows. This entire sequence is embedded within a setuptools setup script, meaning the malicious payload is triggered during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing and executing a temporary file with remote code, and silent exception handling further indicate malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, executing remote code fetched at install time without user consent, writing and running temp files, and shell execution in setup scripts are strong indicators of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python script to a temporary file that contains a command to fetch and execute code directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/yg9e5/raw) without any user interaction or validation. It then attempts to execute this temporary script using the Python interpreter in a new process. This pattern of dynamically downloading and executing remote code is a critical indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted source. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temporary file, and immediate execution via shell command further supports the malicious intent. There is no error handling or user consent, and the external URL is suspicious and unrelated to any known legitimate application context. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote payload retrieval, dynamic code execution, and execution of untrusted code without validation."
