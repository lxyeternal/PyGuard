      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install with an obfuscated class name and method name. Inside the overridden install method (named WAMWWlbUKQiofHeJFVZSdbVapCuTvKeY), it calls the parent install method and then uses subprocess to execute a Python module ('poc_nvk.my_module') via 'sys.executable -m poc_nvk.my_module'. This means that during package installation, arbitrary code from 'poc_nvk.my_module' is executed without user interaction or consent. The obfuscated names and execution of a module during install strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector, a known malicious pattern. The code triggers execution of potentially untrusted code at install time, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware. There is no indication of legitimate application logic, user notification, or validation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including hostname, operating system name, and IP address, then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eobngnpuin253ze.m.pipedream.net/poc) without any user interaction or consent. The use of a non-standard, obscure domain (pipedream.net endpoint) for data exfiltration is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious behavior. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding the network activity. This pattern matches typical characteristics of information-stealing malware that performs system fingerprinting and exfiltrates data to an attacker-controlled server. Therefore, this code is malicious."
