      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded URL with a non-standard domain, which is unrelated to any legitimate package source. It then creates a raw socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address and port (134.209.85.64:8080), duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, and spawns a shell (/bin/sh). This sequence is a classic reverse shell pattern, enabling remote command execution on the victim machine. Furthermore, this malicious function is invoked inside a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install, which is hooked into the package installation process via the setup() call. This means the reverse shell is triggered automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction, a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated function and class names, absence of error handling or logging, and lack of legitimate application logic further confirm the malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to establish unauthorized remote access to the host system stealthily during package installation."
