      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses any exceptions, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The code also checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The combination of these factors—hidden execution, encoded PowerShell payload, execution during setup, and suppression of errors—matches multiple critical risk patterns associated exclusively with malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
