      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using character code escapes, dynamic eval calls, and base64 decoding combined with zlib decompression. It dynamically imports standard modules and functions under obfuscated variable names, then decodes and decompresses a large payload which is subsequently executed via eval. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious code designed to evade static analysis and hide its true intent. The code also performs multiple decoding steps on data that appears to be compressed and encoded, then executes it dynamically, which is a strong indicator of arbitrary code execution. The obfuscation and use of eval on decompressed data is a critical risk pattern exclusively associated with malware. There is no indication of legitimate application logic, user interaction, or safe handling of the decoded content. Such behavior is consistent with malware that downloads or contains a hidden payload, decompresses and executes it at runtime, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
