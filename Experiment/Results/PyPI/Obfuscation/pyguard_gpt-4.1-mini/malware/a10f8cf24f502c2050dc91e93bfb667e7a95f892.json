      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the hostname, current user, current working directory, and a hardcoded string disguised as a package name. It encodes this information in base64, then further obfuscates it by converting to hex and appending random and sequential identifiers. It then sends this encoded data covertly by issuing multiple 'ping' commands to subdomains constructed from this data appended to a suspicious domain '.sub.deliverycontent.online'. Subsequently, it attempts multiple HTTP requests (GET and POST) to a hardcoded suspicious domain 'www.deliverycontent.online', sending the encoded system information as part of the request payload or URL parameters. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, uses obfuscation techniques (random variable names, hex encoding, base64 encoding), and performs network communication without any user interaction or consent. These behaviors are classic indicators of malicious activity, specifically system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to an attacker-controlled server. The use of non-standard domains, obfuscated data transmission via DNS queries (ping), and multiple HTTP requests to suspicious endpoints strongly indicate this code is designed for covert data exfiltration and reconnaissance, which is malicious."
