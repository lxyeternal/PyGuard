      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to execute code during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, on macOS ('darwin'), it runs a base64-decoded shell command 'ioreg -k IOPatformUUID' to retrieve the system's platform UUID, extracts it via regex, and hashes it with SHA-256. It then checks if this hash is in a hardcoded list of hashes. If matched, it proceeds to read two files from the user's home directory under a hidden '.config/gcloud' path, and sends their contents via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded suspicious domain 'europe-west2-workload-422915.cloudfunctions.net' with a custom header containing the hashed UUID. This is a clear data exfiltration attempt of potentially sensitive credential files without user consent or notification. The code suppresses all exceptions during this process, avoiding detection. The obfuscated function and variable names, base64 encoding, and embedding of this logic in the install command further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The network communication is to a non-standard, suspicious endpoint unrelated to the package's stated purpose. Overall, this is a classic example of a malicious PyPI package performing credential theft via a post-install hook, constituting a high-severity supply chain attack."
