      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call from distutils.core, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution in the same script strongly indicates malicious intent. According to the provided knowledge points, spawning PowerShell in hidden mode with encoded commands during package installation is a hallmark of malware seeking to evade detection and execute unauthorized actions. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
