      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to perform malicious actions. During installation, it creates a temporary directory with a suspicious prefix 'DriverGenius', then downloads two executable files from hardcoded, suspicious URLs ('https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/c.exe' and 'https://fus.rngupdatem.buzz/dgdeskband64.dll') without any user consent or validation. It writes these files to the temporary directory and immediately executes one of them ('ComServer.exe') with a command line argument via os.system. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack pattern where malicious payloads are fetched and executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. The use of obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded suspicious URLs, writing and executing downloaded binaries, and embedding this logic in the install hook are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic, user interaction, or validation, and the code silently performs these actions, which is consistent with malware delivery and execution."
