      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install process, embedding a method that decrypts and executes an encrypted payload at install time without user consent. The payload is decrypted using a hardcoded Fernet key and executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. The code imports 'requests' and 'fernet' dynamically only if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), indicating platform-specific malicious activity. The encrypted payload is opaque and executed immediately during installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The setup() call uses an obfuscated class name and triggers this malicious install subclass, ensuring the payload runs on package installation. This pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload, execution during install, use of cryptography to hide payload, dynamic imports, and no user interaction or notification. Therefore, this code is malicious."
