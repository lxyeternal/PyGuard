      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install with an obfuscated class name and method name, which is a common obfuscation technique in malicious code. Inside the custom install subclass, it calls a subprocess method with an obfuscated name, passing a command to execute a Python module ('poc_nvk.my_module') using the current Python interpreter. This means that during package installation, arbitrary code from 'poc_nvk.my_module' will be executed without user interaction or consent. Executing code during package installation is a known supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malicious behavior. The obfuscation of class and method names further suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this execution, and the code is embedded in the install hook of a setup script, which is a typical pattern for malware to execute payloads during installation. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system information including hostname, operating system name, and IP address, then sends this data via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://eowdq5q6u6qkhxe.m.pipedream.net/poc). This behavior matches multiple high-risk and critical risk indicators for malicious activity: it performs unsolicited collection of environment and network information without user consent, uses a hardcoded non-standard external endpoint (pipedream.net, often used for capturing webhooks and testing but also abused for data exfiltration), and immediately transmits potentially sensitive system data. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data exfiltration. These factors strongly indicate that the code is designed for unauthorized information gathering and exfiltration, which is a hallmark of malware or spyware."
