      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent. The use of encrypted payloads and dynamic execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true payload from static analysis. The code is embedded in the setup.py install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) further supports the likelihood that the decrypted code performs network communication or other malicious actions. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution at install time, lack of user interaction, and use of encrypted code executed dynamically."
