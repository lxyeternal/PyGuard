      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'main' and immediately calls a function with an obfuscated name 'JWuZesOuIoozKareEzJjYRhYynTlzwiQ' without any context, parameters, or user interaction. The use of an obscure, non-descriptive function name strongly suggests obfuscation, which is a common tactic in malicious code to hide intent. Since the code snippet provides no legitimate application logic or explanation, and given the suspicious naming and immediate execution pattern, it is highly likely that this code triggers hidden or unauthorized actions such as downloading and executing payloads, exfiltrating data, or performing other malicious activities. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators including obfuscation, lack of transparency, and immediate execution of potentially harmful code without user consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'main' and immediately calls a function with a highly obfuscated and nonsensical name 'JWuZesOuIoozKareEzJjYRhYynTlzwiQ'. This pattern of using obfuscated function names is a common tactic in malicious code to hide intent and evade detection. Without any further context or legitimate naming, such a call strongly suggests that the function likely performs hidden or unauthorized actions. Given the absence of any user interaction, documentation, or clear application logic, and the use of an obfuscated function name, this code is highly suspicious and consistent with malicious behavior patterns such as executing hidden payloads, remote code execution, or other unauthorized operations."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, cookies, passwords, billing information, and system environment details without user consent. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to hide its intent. It accesses environment variables to locate user data directories, copies and decrypts browser and Discord data (including encrypted tokens and passwords), and exfiltrates this information to a hardcoded suspicious webhook URL (https://webhook.wyvern.lol) via HTTP POST requests. The code also performs threading to stealthily gather and send data, uses Windows DPAPI decryption via ctypes to decrypt encrypted keys, and uploads stolen files to external file hosting services. The presence of cryptographic operations, obfuscated network communication, and automated data exfiltration without user interaction or notification confirms its malicious nature. This code is a credential and data stealer targeting Discord and browser data, designed to run silently and send stolen information to an attacker-controlled server."
