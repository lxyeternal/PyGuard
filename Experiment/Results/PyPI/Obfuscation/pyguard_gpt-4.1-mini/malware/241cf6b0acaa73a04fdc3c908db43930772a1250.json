      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious intent as a normal package setup script. Given these factors, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated hidden execution, stealth process spawning, and execution during package setup, all consistent with malware patterns."
