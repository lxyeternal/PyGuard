      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to disk as 'pics.exe' and then immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen without validation or integrity checks. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The behavior of downloading and running an executable from an untrusted external source without user notification or safeguards is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote payload delivery and execution. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious activity and poses a critical security risk."
