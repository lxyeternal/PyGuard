      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The code abuses the setuptools install hook to run hidden, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) further suggests the payload may perform network communication or other malicious actions after decryption. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution during package installation, use of encryption to hide payload, and lack of user interaction or notification."
