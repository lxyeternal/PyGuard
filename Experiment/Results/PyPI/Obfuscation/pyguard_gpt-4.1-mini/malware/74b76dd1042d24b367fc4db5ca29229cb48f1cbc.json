      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It executes during package setup (installation) without user consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, it defines and immediately calls a function only on macOS platforms that collects detailed system information by running shell commands: 'uname -a' (system info), 'id' (user identity), 'pwd' (current directory), and 'ifconfig' (network interfaces). This information is aggregated into a dictionary, serialized to JSON, then base64-encoded to obfuscate the data. The encoded data is printed and then sent via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http:/81.70.191.194:14333/start/...), which is not a standard or trusted domain. The use of os.popen to execute multiple shell commands and os.system to send data externally without user interaction or notification is a strong indicator of data exfiltration. The obfuscation via base64 encoding and the immediate network transmission of sensitive system information during installation are classic hallmarks of malware, specifically information-stealing or reconnaissance malware. The code also uses obfuscated variable names and duplicates imports unnecessarily, which are common evasion techniques. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily collect and exfiltrate system information during package installation, constituting malicious behavior."
