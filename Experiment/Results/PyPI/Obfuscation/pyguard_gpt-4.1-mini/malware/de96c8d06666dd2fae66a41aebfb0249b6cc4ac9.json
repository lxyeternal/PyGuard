      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses base64 decoding combined with marshal.loads to dynamically reconstruct and execute Python bytecode. This technique is a strong indicator of malicious intent as it hides the actual payload from static analysis. The decoded payload likely contains further obfuscated or compressed code that is executed immediately via exec, which is a classic pattern for malware to evade detection and perform arbitrary code execution. Additionally, the embedded base64 string decodes to a marshal serialized object, which is not a common practice in benign code and is often used to conceal malicious payloads. Given the use of these obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques without any legitimate context or user interaction, this code exhibits critical risk patterns consistent with malware, such as remote code execution, payload hiding, and evasion of static analysis."
