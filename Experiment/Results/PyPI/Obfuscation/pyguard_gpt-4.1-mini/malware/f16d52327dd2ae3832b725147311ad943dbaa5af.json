      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior because it executes an unsupervised shell command via os.system during the package setup process. Specifically, it runs a curl command to fetch a resource from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (http://canarytokens.com/images/static/brqx28acq8gohneyj1yvhcknu/contact.php) without any user interaction, validation, or notification. This pattern is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables remote code retrieval or tracking during package installation, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of a suspicious domain unrelated to the package's stated purpose, combined with execution of a network command in setup.py, aligns with known malicious behaviors such as remote payload retrieval, command execution at install time, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise."
