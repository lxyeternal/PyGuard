      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated with non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It uses dynamic attribute access and string construction to hide function and method names. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. It performs environment checks, imports modules dynamically, and writes files to user directories. It uses Windows COM interfaces to create and save shortcuts, indicating persistence mechanisms. The code enumerates files in user directories, writes executable or script files, and executes shell commands. It also checks for administrative privileges and conditionally performs actions. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, file writing in user directories, persistence setup, and execution during package setup strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with malware or a supply chain attack payload."
