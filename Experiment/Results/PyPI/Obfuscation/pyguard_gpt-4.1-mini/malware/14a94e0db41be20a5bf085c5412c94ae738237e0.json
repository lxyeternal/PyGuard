      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, it collects the system's hostname and IP address, then asynchronously sends this information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is embedded in the package's setup installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of an obfuscated class name and method name, combined with the silent exfiltration of system information to an external endpoint, strongly indicates malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic related to the package installation and instead performs covert data exfiltration. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as: execution of network communication during install, use of hardcoded suspicious webhook URL, exfiltration of system fingerprinting data (hostname and IP), obfuscation of code structure, and lack of user notification or consent."
