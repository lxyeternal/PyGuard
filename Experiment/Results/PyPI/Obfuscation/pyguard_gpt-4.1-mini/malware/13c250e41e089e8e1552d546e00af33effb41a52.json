      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a large base64-encoded and zlib-compressed payload stored in the variable 'uaLymvJFHbXXbqsvOZXrAsqHgbBafDWh'. This payload is decoded and decompressed at runtime, then immediately executed using 'exec'. This pattern is a strong and well-known indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source, bypassing static analysis and code review. The obfuscation of variable and function names further supports the intent to hide the code's true purpose. There is no legitimate application logic surrounding this dynamic execution, and the code does not perform any user interaction or consent before executing the payload. Such behavior is consistent with malware delivery, code injection, or remote payload execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
