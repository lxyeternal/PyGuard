      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system environment information including the OS details (os.uname), the user's home directory (os.path.expanduser('~')), and the current working directory (os.getcwd). It then serializes this information into JSON, encodes it in base64, and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL 'https://pypi.org/reqs?d=' concatenated with the encoded data. The request includes a forged 'Host' header pointing to 'psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net', which is not consistent with the URL domain, indicating an attempt to disguise or redirect the request. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with obfuscated data encoding and exfiltration to an external endpoint is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with information-stealing or staging malware. There is no user interaction, no legitimate application logic, and the obfuscation of function and variable names further supports malicious intent."
