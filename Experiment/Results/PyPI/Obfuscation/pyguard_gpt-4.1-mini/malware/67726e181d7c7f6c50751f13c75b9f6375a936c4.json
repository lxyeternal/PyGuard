      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable and function names and a custom decoding function that reconstructs and evaluates a dynamically generated string via eval(), which is a classic obfuscation and code injection technique enabling arbitrary code execution. The presence of eval on dynamically decoded data is a critical red flag. Additionally, the code executes a shell command via os.system('whoami') immediately during import, which is unusual and suspicious in a setup script context. The code is embedded in a setup.py-like script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, allowing execution of arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and execution of shell commands during package setup strongly indicate malicious intent."
