      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags. This is a classic technique to run obfuscated PowerShell commands stealthily without user interaction or consent. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a known obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks if a directory named 'tahg' exists and only then runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure environment suitability. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess with hidden window style and encoded PowerShell commands is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it enables stealthy execution of potentially harmful payloads. The rest of the code is a standard setup call with no suspicious behavior, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution in the same script strongly indicates malicious activity."
