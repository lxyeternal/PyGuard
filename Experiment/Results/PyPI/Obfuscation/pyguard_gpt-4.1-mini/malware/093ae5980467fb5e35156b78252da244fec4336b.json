      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that, during installation, downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://tryg.ga/normal.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It saves this file as 'normal.exe' and immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector where malicious payloads are fetched and executed during package installation. The use of an obscure domain, lack of validation or user notification, obfuscated class and method names, and execution of a downloaded executable without integrity checks or user consent strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern is a high-risk indicator of malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system during package installation, potentially leading to system compromise, persistence, or further payload delivery."
