      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It begins by executing a shell command to install a large number of packages via pip without user consent, which is suspicious and can be used to prepare the environment for malicious activities. The code then imports numerous modules commonly used in malware for system interaction, network communication, clipboard access, cryptography, and Windows registry manipulation. Most critically, it contains an obfuscated payload: a large gzip-compressed, marshal-serialized byte string that is decompressed and executed dynamically via exec. This pattern of obfuscated, compressed, and dynamically executed code is a hallmark of malware, used to hide the true intent and evade static analysis. The presence of Windows-specific cryptographic API calls (CryptUnprotectData) suggests potential credential theft or decryption of protected data. The combination of these factors—dynamic execution of obfuscated payload, environment preparation via pip install, use of cryptography and clipboard modules, and Windows registry access—strongly indicates malicious intent, likely for information stealing, persistence, or remote code execution."
