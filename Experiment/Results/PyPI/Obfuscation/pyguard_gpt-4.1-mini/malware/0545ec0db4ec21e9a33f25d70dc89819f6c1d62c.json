      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The subprocess call uses the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, likely to mask the malicious behavior. These factors combined—hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands, conditional directory existence check, suppression of windows, and embedding in a setup script—are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with known malware patterns."
