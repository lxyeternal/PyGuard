      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically executes obfuscated Python code via exec on a string constructed from character codes, which is a common obfuscation technique used by malware. It imports multiple modules including requests and socket, then defines a setup function that installs packages, indicating it runs during package installation (a known supply chain attack vector). The function send_discord_info collects system information and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious hardcoded URL (https://pastebin.pl/view/raw/e0db51a5), which is not a standard or trusted domain. It writes the downloaded content to a file named 'WindowsDefender.py' in the user's home directory and executes it with Python, which is a classic download-and-execute pattern used by malware to fetch and run additional payloads. After execution, it deletes the file, indicating self-cleanup to evade detection. The code also sets up a package installation with a URL pointing to a GitHub repository, but the main malicious behavior is the download and execution of remote code without user consent or validation. These behaviors—dynamic code execution, obfuscated payload, downloading and running code from an untrusted external source, self-deletion, and execution during package installation—are strong indicators of malicious intent."
