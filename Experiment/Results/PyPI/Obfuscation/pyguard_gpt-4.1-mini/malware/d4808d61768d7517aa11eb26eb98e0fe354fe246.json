      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method that decrypts and executes an encrypted payload at install time without user consent. Specifically, during installation on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted byte string and executes the decrypted code via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during install time without user interaction strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also lists 'fernet' and 'requests' as dependencies, likely to support the malicious payload's network or cryptographic operations. Overall, this is a high-risk malicious pattern consistent with malware that executes hidden payloads during package installation."
