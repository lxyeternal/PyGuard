      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using character code escapes and dynamic evaluation (eval) of strings constructed from encoded data. It imports standard modules in an obfuscated manner and defines functions that decode and transform data. The code decodes a large base64-encoded and possibly compressed payload, then dynamically executes it. This pattern of decoding obfuscated data and executing it at runtime is a classic hallmark of malicious code, as it allows attackers to hide the true intent and payload from static analysis. The code also uses multiple layers of decoding and dynamic imports, which are common evasion techniques. Given the absence of any legitimate application logic, the use of eval on decoded data, and the presence of large encoded payloads, this code is very likely designed to execute hidden malicious payloads, potentially downloading or running further malware, exfiltrating data, or establishing persistence. Therefore, it exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
