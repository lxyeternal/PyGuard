      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The use of subprocess with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. There is no legitimate application logic surrounding the PowerShell execution, and the obfuscation and hidden execution strongly indicate malicious intent."
