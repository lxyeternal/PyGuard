      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently, increasing stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. Additionally, this execution is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The combination of hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, silent exception handling, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
