      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It performs an HTTP GET request to a legitimate site (baidu.com) but more critically, it defines a function that executes a shell command via subprocess.run with shell=True, which sends extensive system information to a hardcoded external IP address (http://43.139.166.32:8080) using curl. The data exfiltrated includes hostname, current user, present working directory, directory listing, security groups, user directory contents, contents of /etc/passwd, installed NPM modules, and bash history. This is a clear case of system fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent. Furthermore, this code is embedded in a setup script (using setuptools.setup), which means it could be executed during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names and the lack of any legitimate application logic around the network and shell execution calls further support the malicious classification. There is no user interaction, no error handling, and the external IP is hardcoded and suspicious. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
