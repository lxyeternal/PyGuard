      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which is a known vector for executing code during package installation (a supply chain attack vector). Inside this class, there is a method named XptvaGNtdhnFZuDlvPQFLBcdGdngczKE that imports the 'requests' module and makes an HTTP GET request to 'https://ipinfo.io/json' to retrieve JSON data about the host's IP and location. This network activity occurs without any user interaction or consent during the installation process, which is suspicious. The class and method names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The code is embedded in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a critical risk pattern for malware. Although the code only prints the fetched JSON data, the use of network communication during install time without user consent, obfuscation, and embedding in the install command class strongly indicate malicious behavior consistent with reconnaissance or data exfiltration preparation. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior."

It then sets executable permissions on this script and executes it with bash, passing specific arguments. Additionally, it runs system commands to update package lists and install 'tmux' without user interaction. The function and variable names are obfuscated, and there is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding these network and execution actions. This pattern—unsupervised download and execution of remote code from a suspicious domain, writing executable files to user directories, and immediate shell execution—is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, consistent with remote payload retrieval and execution often seen in malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."

It then executes the downloaded content directly as shell commands via subprocess with shell=True, including with elevated privileges (sudo) for the 'sys' script. The variable and function names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. There is no user interaction, consent, or validation before executing potentially untrusted code fetched from the internet. This pattern matches a critical risk indicator of remote code execution from untrusted sources, a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The absence of error handling or logging further increases suspicion. Therefore, this code is malicious as it enables arbitrary code execution from untrusted, remote sources without safeguards."
