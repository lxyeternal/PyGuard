      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules to perform a network request to a suspicious hardcoded URL ('https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/bcexv/raw'), reads the response, writes it to a temporary file without user consent, and then executes it via a system call. This sequence is embedded in the setup script, meaning it triggers during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation via base64 encoding, dynamic execution, network fetching of executable code, and execution without validation or user interaction are all critical risk indicators of malware. Additionally, the package metadata keywords suggest it is a YouTube view/live stream botter, which is often associated with malicious or fraudulent activity. Therefore, this code exhibits multiple high-risk malicious behaviors including remote code execution, obfuscation, and execution during installation."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically at runtime using exec and compile. This payload imports modules and executes a system command that downloads and executes code from a suspicious external URL (https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/bcexv/raw) without any user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic execution, and fetching code from an untrusted external source are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code uses os.system calls to execute shell commands, including clearing the console and setting the window title, which are typical in malware to manipulate the environment stealthily. The overall structure, obfuscation, and network activity align with known malicious patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, and evasion techniques."
