      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command via subprocess with shell=True that performs a curl POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://eozjyg0uj1pesea.m.pipedream.net). The POST request includes headers that dynamically inject system information such as hostname, current user (whoami), and current working directory (pwd), as well as the output of 'ls -la' as the POST data. This behavior is consistent with unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive system information to an external endpoint without user consent or interaction. The use of a suspicious, non-standard external URL and the immediate execution of this command upon running the script further indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity, and the function and variable names are obfuscated, which is typical in malware to evade detection."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides an install method with an obfuscated name. Inside this method, it calls a function RmJReULVpQThXeFLfVaiDbXDFyjNzPEb imported from a module named pre_install, which is not a standard or commonly known module. This function is invoked during the package installation process without any user interaction or consent. The obfuscated names and the execution of code during the install phase strongly indicate an attempt to execute arbitrary or hidden code as part of the package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. Additionally, the setup metadata includes a suspicious, non-standard download URL ('http://notapplicable.notapplicable'), which is not a legitimate domain, further suggesting malicious intent. The lack of any legitimate application logic or documentation around the invoked function, combined with the obfuscation and execution at install time, matches multiple critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including arbitrary code execution during package installation and obfuscation to hide intent."
