      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function that collects all environment variables from the host system, encodes them, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded external URL (https://webhook.site/8f782c5b-990f-4d3d-94cc-fd128b873693), which is a suspicious webhook endpoint commonly used for data collection or exfiltration. This function is called automatically during the package installation and development setup phases by subclassing setuptools' install and develop commands and overriding their methods to invoke this data exfiltration without user consent or interaction. The variable and function names are obfuscated, and the network activity occurs silently during installation, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, and the code exfiltrates potentially sensitive environment information to an attacker-controlled endpoint. These factors strongly indicate malicious intent."
