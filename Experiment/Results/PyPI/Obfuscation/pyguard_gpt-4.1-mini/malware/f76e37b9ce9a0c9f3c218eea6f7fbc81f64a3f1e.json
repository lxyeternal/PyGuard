      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions, indicating an attempt to hide failures or detection. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. The combination of hidden PowerShell execution, encoded commands, lack of user interaction, obfuscation, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
