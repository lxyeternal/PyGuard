      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses the 'requests' library to fetch Python code from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('https://pastebin.com/raw/f84dfw0m') and immediately executes it using eval(). This pattern is a critical red flag for malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source without any user interaction, validation, or consent. The dynamic execution of remote code during package setup is a known vector for supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The use of eval() on network-fetched content in a setup script strongly indicates an attempt to execute malicious payloads during installation, which is a hallmark of malware. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
