      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method (znqrtDvVQniCfpaSdRSHwPtUVzjPKwIm) to execute arbitrary code during package installation. This method checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source. The use of obfuscated variable and class names, encrypted payload, and execution during install time without user consent strongly indicates malicious intent. The setup() call installs this custom install command, triggering the malicious code execution during package installation. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery or system compromise. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
