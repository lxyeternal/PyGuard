It attempts to download an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and saves it to a user directory under the name 'WindowsCache.exe'. Immediately after downloading, it executes this file via PowerShell using 'Invoke-Expression'. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior: remote payload retrieval and execution during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The code suppresses exceptions silently, uses subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to hide the execution window, and does not validate or notify the user about the downloaded executable. The use of a hardcoded Dropbox URL to fetch an executable and run it without validation or user consent is highly suspicious and consistent with malware delivery and execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
