      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call suppresses the window and runs the command without user interaction or consent. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before running the command, which may be a staging or evasion technique. This execution happens during the import or setup phase, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. The use of distutils.core.setup with a suspicious package name and version, combined with the hidden PowerShell execution, strongly suggests this is a malicious payload embedded in a package installation script. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further indicating an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealthy execution, obfuscation, execution during installation, and lack of user consent."
