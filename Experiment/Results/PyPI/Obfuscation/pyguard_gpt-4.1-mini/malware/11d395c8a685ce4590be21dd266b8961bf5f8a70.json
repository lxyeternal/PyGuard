      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It embeds a reverse shell payload inside a string variable (DtIzzVRDiWQdonhAAmQfnNYitVotfrIk) that is written to a Python script named 'remote-access.py'. This script attempts to establish a TCP connection to a hardcoded IP address (127.0.0.1) on port 1234 and, upon connection, spawns an interactive shell (cmd.exe on Windows or /bin/bash on Linux) with input/output redirected over the socket, effectively creating a remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell. The malicious payload is installed and executed automatically during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the install method to write and launch the reverse shell script without user consent or interaction. The code uses obfuscated variable names and performs file operations in user home directories (or Documents on Windows), which is typical for persistence or stealth. The immediate spawning of a shell process over a network socket, combined with execution triggered during package installation, is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the network connection is outbound, enabling unauthorized remote control of the victim machine. All these factors confirm that the code is malicious."
