      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via exec(). The decoded payload itself appears to be further obfuscated or encrypted, indicating an attempt to hide the true intent of the code. The use of exec() on decoded base64 data is a classic hallmark of malicious code, as it allows arbitrary code execution while evading static analysis. The code lacks any legitimate application logic or user interaction and is designed to execute hidden payloads dynamically. Such patterns are strongly associated with malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, or information theft. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
