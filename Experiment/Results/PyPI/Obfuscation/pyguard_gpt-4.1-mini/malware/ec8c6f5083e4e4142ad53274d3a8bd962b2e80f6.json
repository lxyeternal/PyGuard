It writes this executable to a temporary file and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables remote code execution of potentially untrusted and harmful payloads. The code is embedded in a setup script context, which can be used as a supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before execution, and the variable names are obfuscated, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to a temporary file with an obfuscated variable name and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern matches a classic remote payload retrieval and execution technique commonly used by malware to deliver and run arbitrary code on the victim's system. The absence of any legitimate application logic, user notification, or integrity checks, combined with the direct execution of a downloaded executable, strongly indicates malicious intent."
