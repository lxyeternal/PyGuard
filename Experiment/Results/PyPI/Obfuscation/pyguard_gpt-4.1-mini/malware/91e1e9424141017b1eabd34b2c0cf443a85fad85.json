      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides a method that is executed during installation. Within this method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. The payload execution is triggered only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'), suggesting targeted malicious activity. The use of encrypted and obfuscated payload hidden in the install script, combined with execution during package installation without user consent, is a classic supply chain attack vector. The setup() call registers this custom install command, ensuring the malicious code runs automatically when the package is installed. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery or system compromise."
