      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects detailed user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, creation date, and IP address. This sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. The use of obfuscated variable names, absence of user interaction or consent, silent exception handling, and direct transmission of authentication tokens and personal data to an external endpoint are strong indicators of malicious intent. This behavior aligns with credential theft and data exfiltration malware patterns, specifically targeting Roblox accounts for unauthorized access or theft."
