      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that creates a file '/tmp/test1563.txt' as a marker, then another function that checks for this file and if not present, establishes a TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (59.110.111.85) on port 8088. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) connected to this socket. This is a classic reverse shell pattern, allowing remote command execution by an attacker. The reverse shell is launched in a separate thread, which is a common evasion technique. The code is embedded in a setup script context, which can trigger execution during package installation without user consent, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated function and variable names further suggests intent to evade detection. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying these actions. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to provide unauthorized remote access to the host system."
