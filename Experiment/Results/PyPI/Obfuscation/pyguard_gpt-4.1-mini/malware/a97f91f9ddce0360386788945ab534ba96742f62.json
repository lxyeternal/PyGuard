      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically via exec(). The decoded payload creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.1.69) on port 4444, attempts to connect, and then enters a loop receiving data, decompressing it with zlib, decoding from base64, and executing it. This pattern is a classic reverse shell or remote code execution backdoor, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic execution (exec), socket connection to a hardcoded IP, and decompression of received data are all strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setuptools setup script, which means it will execute during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is highly malicious."
