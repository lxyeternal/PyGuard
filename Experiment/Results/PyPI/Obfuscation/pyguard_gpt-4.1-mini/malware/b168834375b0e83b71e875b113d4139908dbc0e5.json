      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports everything from a relative module named 'src_file' and then calls a function with an obfuscated, nonsensical name 'AkaZRlGQjVIqeitKqceyYidozfYNwsXp()' without any context or explanation. The use of a relative import with a wildcard import (*) combined with an obfuscated function name strongly suggests an attempt to hide the actual behavior of the code. This pattern is typical in malicious code to evade detection and analysis. The code snippet provides no user interaction, no legitimate application logic, and no comments or documentation. Given the obfuscation and lack of transparency, this code is highly suspicious and likely malicious, as it fits the pattern of executing hidden or dynamically loaded payloads without user consent or clarity."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It attempts to collect sensitive wallet-related files from the user's roaming appdata directory, specifically targeting the 'exodus' wallet files, which are known to contain cryptocurrency wallet data such as seeds, passphrases, and two-factor authentication secrets. The code constructs paths to these sensitive files and attempts to add them to a ZIP archive without user consent or notification. It then collects the victim's username and IP address via an external API call, encodes the country code into regional indicator symbols (likely to obfuscate or stylize the message), and sends both a message and the ZIP archive containing stolen wallet files to a hardcoded Telegram bot token and chat ID. The use of obfuscated variable names, silent exception handling, and direct exfiltration of sensitive data to an external Telegram bot endpoint without any user interaction or legitimate application logic strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the code attempts to clean up by deleting the ZIP archive after sending, which is a common anti-forensics technique. These behaviors align with typical cryptocurrency wallet stealers and data exfiltration malware."
