      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules to perform HTTP requests to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://20.226.18.203) and fetches remote content from endpoints '/grab/ry2K1CIVRSFa59vT' and '/clip'. It writes the fetched content to a temporary file and executes it, which is a classic download-and-execute pattern used by malware. The code also attempts to start a new thread to execute the downloaded file with a replaced extension, indicating further execution of potentially malicious code. There is no user interaction, validation, or notification, and the use of obfuscation (base64 encoding, dynamic imports, exec) hides the true intent. The hardcoded IP address and endpoints are suspicious and unrelated to any legitimate application logic. These behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including remote code execution, payload retrieval, obfuscation, and execution without user consent."
