      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to stealthily extract the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie from various browsers' stored cookies using the 'browser_cookie3' library without user consent. This cookie is a sensitive authentication token for Roblox accounts. The script then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects extensive user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, creation date, and IP address. It sends all this sensitive data, including the '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookie itself, to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. It also executes shell commands via os.system without user interaction. The presence of hardcoded external webhook URLs, exfiltration of sensitive authentication tokens and personal data, lack of user consent or notification, and obfuscation strongly indicate that this code is designed for credential theft and data exfiltration, which are malicious activities."
