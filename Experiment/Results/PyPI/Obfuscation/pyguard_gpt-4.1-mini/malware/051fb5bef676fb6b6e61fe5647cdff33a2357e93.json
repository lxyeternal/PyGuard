      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports 'pytransform' and calls 'pyarmor_runtime()', then invokes '__pyarmor__' with a large byte string argument. This pattern is characteristic of PyArmor-protected or obfuscated Python code. PyArmor is a tool used to obfuscate Python scripts to prevent reverse engineering. The presence of such obfuscation, especially with a large embedded byte string, is a strong indicator of concealed behavior. Given the extensive knowledge points, obfuscated code with embedded encrypted payloads that execute at runtime is a hallmark of malicious activity, as it allows attackers to hide and dynamically execute arbitrary code, bypassing static detection and code review. Without the ability to deobfuscate and analyze the hidden payload, the code should be treated as malicious due to the high risk associated with such obfuscation and runtime code execution."
