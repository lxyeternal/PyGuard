      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with a reverse shell backdoor. Specifically, it defines a function (esWkCMNUNFKHQPiErbNIZFpTAKDZaimA) that creates a TCP socket and connects to a hardcoded external IP address (59.110.111.85) on port 8088. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) via subprocess.call. This effectively grants remote shell access to the attacker. The code also checks for the existence of a specific file (/tmp/test1563.txt) to avoid repeated execution, and creates this file as a marker (via the LNVpdrxNBUdnhMIgDAXLhcinjrNESGIF function). The reverse shell is launched in a child process created by os.fork(), allowing the main process to continue or exit silently. The obfuscated function and variable names, the use of a hardcoded IP and port, the socket duplication to stdin/stdout/stderr, and spawning a shell are classic hallmarks of a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious and designed to provide unauthorized remote shell access to an attacker."
