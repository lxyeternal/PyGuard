      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install process to execute additional code during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it downloads an executable file named 'funnymoment.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on Discord's CDN, saves it to a temporary directory, and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern of downloading and executing an external binary during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. There is no validation, user notification, or integrity check on the downloaded file, increasing the risk of arbitrary code execution. The use of a non-standard URL unrelated to the package's stated purpose, combined with execution of the downloaded payload, confirms the code is malicious."
