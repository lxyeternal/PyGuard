      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The script reads the source file of the standard 'socket' module and appends the contents of a file named 'WebQuickAuth/tmp.py' to it, then dynamically imports 'WebQuickAuth.tmp'. This effectively injects and executes arbitrary code from 'tmp.py' into a standard library module, which is highly suspicious and a known malware technique to evade detection and gain code execution during package installation. The use of dynamic import of a module from a temporary file without user consent or validation is a critical red flag. The package name 'tqdvxgm3a38rwfsz' appears random and obfuscated, which is typical in malicious packages to avoid easy detection. There is no legitimate application logic justifying the modification of the socket module source file or the dynamic import of arbitrary code during setup. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as code injection, arbitrary code execution at install time, and supply chain attack vectors. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It creates a suspicious directory in the temporary folder with an obfuscated name, uses obfuscated variable names, and performs stealthy file operations to evade detection. It attempts to spawn a background process with a hidden flag and uses threading to maintain persistence. Critically, it establishes an outbound SSL-wrapped socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (8.217.153.123) on port 8889, which is a hallmark of command-and-control (C2) communication. The code receives a length-prefixed, base64-encoded, and zlib-compressed payload from this connection, which it decompresses and executes dynamically using exec(). This pattern of fetching, decoding, decompressing, and executing remote code at runtime is a classic remote code execution and backdoor technique. The absence of user interaction, obfuscation, use of hardcoded IP, dynamic code execution, and stealthy threading all strongly indicate that this code is malicious."
