It then immediately executes this temporary file using a system shell command that launches a Python interpreter process. This pattern of dynamically downloading and executing remote code during package setup is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temporary file, and executing it via os.system in the setup script further confirms the intent to stealthily run untrusted code. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification, and the external URL is suspicious and unrelated to any known package repository. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."

It then closes the file and immediately executes it using a system shell command that runs the Python interpreter in windowed mode. This pattern of dynamically downloading and executing remote code without user consent is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temporary file, and executing it via shell commands further supports the malicious intent. The external URL is suspicious and not associated with any known legitimate source. There is no error handling, logging, or user notification, increasing the risk. This code effectively enables remote code execution, which can lead to arbitrary payload delivery, persistence, or further compromise."
