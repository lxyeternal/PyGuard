      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses the setuptools install command to register an atexit handler function that executes upon installation completion. This function performs several suspicious actions: it writes a file named 'pocbykotko.txt' with arbitrary content, collects the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://api.ipify.org', retrieves the hostname via os.uname(), and obtains the absolute path of the current script's directory. It then encodes this collected system information (IP, hostname, path) into a base64 string and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with a constructed query parameter. The use of obfuscated variable names, the silent exfiltration of system information without user consent, embedding this behavior in the install command, and the use of a non-standard external URL for data transmission are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including environment fingerprinting, data encoding and exfiltration, and execution of network communication during package installation without user interaction or notification."
