It uses obfuscated variable names and dynamic string construction to hide its intent. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and malicious package installation. It performs environment checks, imports modules dynamically, and writes files to user directories without consent. It uses Windows COM objects to create and save shortcuts, manipulates file system paths, and attempts to escalate privileges by checking for administrative rights. The code enumerates files in user directories, writes executable or script files, and executes shell commands. The obfuscation and complex control flow are designed to evade static analysis. These behaviors align with known malware patterns such as persistence setup, payload deployment, and potential remote code execution. Therefore, this code is malicious."
