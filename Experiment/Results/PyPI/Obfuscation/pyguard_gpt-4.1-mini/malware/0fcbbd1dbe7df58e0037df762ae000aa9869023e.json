      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens outside of any user interaction or consent, and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code calls setup() with suspicious package metadata, likely to disguise the malicious intent. These patterns match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including hidden process execution, obfuscated payload delivery, and execution during package installation without user consent."
