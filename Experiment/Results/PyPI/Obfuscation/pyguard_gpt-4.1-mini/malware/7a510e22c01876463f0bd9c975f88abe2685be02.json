      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then runs this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade analysis or ensure environment suitability. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, increasing stealth. The rest of the code is a standard setup call with no suspicious behavior, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution in the setup context is a critical risk indicator of malicious intent."
