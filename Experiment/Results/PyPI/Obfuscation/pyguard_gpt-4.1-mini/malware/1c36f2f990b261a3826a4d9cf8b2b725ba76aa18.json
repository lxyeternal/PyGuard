      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the install process in a setuptools setup script. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The code abuses the installation process (a known supply chain attack vector) to run hidden code, which may perform further malicious actions such as downloading additional payloads or exfiltrating data. The presence of cryptography, dynamic code execution, and execution in the install hook matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
