      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute a function that attempts to establish a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (49.233.121.53) on port 54. The function creates a socket, connects to the remote IP, duplicates the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, and then spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i). This behavior is a classic reverse shell payload, allowing an attacker to remotely execute commands on the victim machine without user consent. The use of base64 encoding to obscure the IP and port, obfuscated class and function names, and embedding this payload in the installation process (setup.py) are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network connection and shell spawning. This pattern is a well-known hallmark of malware, specifically remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors, and is highly dangerous as it enables unauthorized remote control of the system."
