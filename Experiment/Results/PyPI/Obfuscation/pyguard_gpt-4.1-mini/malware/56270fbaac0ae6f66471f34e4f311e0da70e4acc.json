      "malicious_behavior": "The code is designed to stealthily collect Discord authentication tokens from various local application data directories, including Discord clients and several browsers. It searches for token patterns in LevelDB files under Local Storage directories. The collected tokens are then formatted and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external endpoint controlled by an attacker. This behavior constitutes unauthorized credential theft and data exfiltration. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. There is no user interaction or consent, and the data is sent immediately upon execution. These characteristics align with typical malicious patterns of information-stealing malware."
