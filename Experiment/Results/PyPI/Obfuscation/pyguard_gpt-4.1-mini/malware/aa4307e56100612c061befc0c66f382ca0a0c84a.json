      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command in a Python package setup. During installation, it attempts to send the host's hostname and IP address to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, non-standard endpoint unrelated to any legitimate package functionality. This exfiltration of system information during package installation without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class and method names, the hardcoded Discord webhook URL, and the immediate network communication during install strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. This pattern matches known malicious behaviors of data exfiltration and unauthorized remote communication embedded in package installation scripts."
