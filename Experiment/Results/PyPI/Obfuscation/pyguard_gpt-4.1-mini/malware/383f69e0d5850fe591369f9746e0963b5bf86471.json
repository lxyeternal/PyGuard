      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install and overrides a method (likely intended to override the install method, but with an obfuscated name). During the installation process, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard, and obfuscated external domain 'jg360c2v1lbkgalt0tygti71hsnkbmzb.oastify.com'. This behavior is characteristic of information exfiltration during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class and method names, the embedding of network communication in the install process, and the transmission of system-specific data to an untrusted external server without user consent or notification are strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including data exfiltration, execution during package installation, use of suspicious external domains, and lack of legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity."
