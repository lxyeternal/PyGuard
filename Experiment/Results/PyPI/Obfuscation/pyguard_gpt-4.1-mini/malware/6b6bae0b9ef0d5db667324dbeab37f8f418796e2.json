      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens silently without user consent or interaction, and the use of a hidden window suppresses any visible indication of the action. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The presence of obfuscated subprocess invocation with encoded PowerShell commands, silent exception handling, and execution during setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
