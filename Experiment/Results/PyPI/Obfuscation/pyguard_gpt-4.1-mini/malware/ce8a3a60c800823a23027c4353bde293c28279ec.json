      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads three executable files from hardcoded local URLs (http://127.0.0.1:5000/listener_exe, payload_exe, Rshell_exe) and writes them to the Windows Temp directory with suspicious names. It then immediately executes one of these executables (Alistener.exe) in a hidden window (creationflags=8) without any user interaction or consent. The function with an obfuscated name is triggered automatically during package installation if the first command-line argument is 'install', which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of hardcoded URLs to fetch executables, writing them to a system temp directory, and executing them silently during installation is a classic pattern of malicious behavior, enabling remote payload delivery and execution. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate application logic surrounding these actions. This pattern is strongly associated with malware and remote code execution attacks."
