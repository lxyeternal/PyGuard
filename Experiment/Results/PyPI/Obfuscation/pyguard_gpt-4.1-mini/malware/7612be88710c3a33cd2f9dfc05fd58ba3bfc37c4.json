      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a known technique to run obfuscated payloads stealthily on Windows systems. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method used by malware to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call is used to launch this hidden PowerShell process without user interaction or consent, and the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing, which may be a persistence or evasion mechanism. This execution happens outside of any legitimate application logic and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands and no error handling strongly indicates malicious intent."
