      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens silently without user interaction or consent, and the use of hidden window style suppresses any visible indication of the command running. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and malicious package installation. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
