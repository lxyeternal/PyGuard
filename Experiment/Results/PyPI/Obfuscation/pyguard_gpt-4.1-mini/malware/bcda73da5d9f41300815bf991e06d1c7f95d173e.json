      "malicious_behavior": "The code silently extracts '.ROBLOSECURITY' cookies from multiple browsers (Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera) for the domain 'roblox.com' using the 'browser_cookie3' library. It then sends these cookies via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, non-standard endpoint unrelated to the application domain. The code suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection and runs the cookie extraction and exfiltration in separate threads without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is a classic example of credential theft and data exfiltration, as it collects sensitive authentication cookies and sends them to an attacker-controlled server. The use of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration, silent operation, and targeting of security tokens strongly indicates malicious intent."
