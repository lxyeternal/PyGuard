      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, it creates a TCP socket and connects to a hardcoded external IP address (104.248.19.57) on port 3333. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (stdin, stdout, stderr) using os.dup2, and spawns a new interactive shell (/bin/sh) via pty.spawn. This effectively creates a reverse shell back to the attacker's server, allowing remote command execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The code is embedded in the package installation process, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded IP, network connection during install, and spawning a shell over the socket are all strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors."
