      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains highly suspicious and malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating an attempt to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call is used to run this command without showing a window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. This execution happens during the import or setup phase, without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspicious package metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
