      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks or malware installation. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with known malware patterns such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or persistence mechanisms."
