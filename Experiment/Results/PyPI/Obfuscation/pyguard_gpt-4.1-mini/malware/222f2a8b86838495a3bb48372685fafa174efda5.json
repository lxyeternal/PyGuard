      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses base64 decoding and dynamic execution (exec) of the decoded payload, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation and malicious intent. The decoded payload creates a socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address ('sidhug-35019.portmap.io') on port 35019, then duplicates the socket file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, effectively creating a reverse shell. This allows remote command execution on the victim's machine without user consent or interaction. The code is embedded inside a setuptools setup script, which means it executes during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The obfuscation, network connection to a suspicious domain, socket duplication to stdin/stdout/stderr, and immediate execution of remote commands are all hallmark behaviors of malware, specifically a reverse shell backdoor. Therefore, this code is malicious."
