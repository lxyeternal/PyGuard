      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is obfuscated with meaningless variable names and contains hardcoded Discord webhook URLs, which are used to exfiltrate data. The function jhNAAXwEzZRWVcsqbfsRcFcWBlCzJFIq collects Discord tokens by scanning local storage directories of various browsers and Discord clients, searching for token patterns in LevelDB files. It then sends these tokens to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks without any user consent or interaction. The code is embedded in a setup script, which can trigger execution during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The presence of environment variable access to user-specific directories, file enumeration, regex token extraction, and immediate HTTP POST to hardcoded external endpoints are classic hallmarks of credential theft malware. The code suppresses exceptions to avoid detection and uses obfuscation to hide its intent. All these factors combined confirm that this code is malicious and designed to steal Discord authentication tokens and exfiltrate them to an attacker."
