      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag, suppressing any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. The use of subprocess.Popen to run an obfuscated PowerShell command during the setup process (package installation) is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspicious package name and version, but this is likely a decoy or to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction surrounding the execution of the hidden PowerShell command. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
