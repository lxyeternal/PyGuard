      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It uses base64 decoding to hide a shell command executed via os.system during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). The decoded command installs the 'requests' package, then downloads an executable file named 'ip_checker.exe' from a suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/Exet75/neofetch/blob/main/ip_checker.exe?raw=true), writes it to disk, and executes it. This behavior is triggered automatically during package installation without user consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of base64 encoding to obfuscate the shell command, the download and execution of an external executable, and the execution of shell commands during install are all strong indicators of malicious intent. The code also prints misleading installation progress messages to disguise the malicious activity. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily download and run potentially harmful payloads on the victim's system during package installation."
