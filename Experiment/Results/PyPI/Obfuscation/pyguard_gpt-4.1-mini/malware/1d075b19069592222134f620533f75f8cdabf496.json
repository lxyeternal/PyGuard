      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function that collects all environment variables from the system (os.environ), encodes them as URL parameters, and sends them via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://2edb-85-48-187-158.ngrok-free.app). This function is called automatically during the package installation and development setup phases by subclassing setuptools' install and develop commands and overriding their methods. The function name and variable names are obfuscated, and the code is embedded in the setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no user interaction or consent before this data exfiltration occurs. The use of a ngrok-free.app domain, which is commonly used for temporary tunnels and often abused in malware, further indicates malicious intent. The code does not perform any legitimate application logic around this network activity, and it exfiltrates potentially sensitive environment information without authorization. These factors collectively indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
