      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the hostname and all environment variables, then encodes this data by percent-encoding non-alphanumeric characters. It establishes a TCP connection to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain ('packageman.comlu.com') on port 80 and sends the encoded system information via an HTTP POST request without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is characteristic of information-stealing malware that performs system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. The code is embedded directly in the setup script, which means it executes during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, silent exception handling (which suppresses errors and avoids detection), and the transmission of sensitive environment data to a non-standard, suspicious domain further confirm malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network activity, making this code a clear example of malicious behavior."
