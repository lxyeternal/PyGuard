      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL and immediately sends a POST request to it with a message payload containing an offensive word. This network communication occurs without any user interaction or consent, which is a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The webhook URL is an external endpoint unrelated to the package's legitimate functionality, suggesting data exfiltration or unauthorized communication. Additionally, the POST request is embedded directly in the setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a try-except block that silently suppresses all exceptions further indicates an attempt to evade detection or error reporting. The rest of the code is a typical setuptools setup call, but the unsolicited network call to an external webhook with offensive content is malicious and inappropriate."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses multiple layers of base64 decoding and exec calls to execute hidden payloads. It imports the 'requests' library and performs an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is a common exfiltration or command-and-control technique. The payload is encoded in base64 and executed dynamically, indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent and evade static analysis. The use of exec on decoded data, especially from an external source or hardcoded encoded string, is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. The code does not include any user interaction, validation, or legitimate application logic, and it immediately executes the decoded payload. These characteristics align with typical malicious behaviors such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, and stealthy payload delivery. Therefore, this code is malicious."
