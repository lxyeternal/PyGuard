      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, embedding obfuscated payload execution during package installation. The payload is stored as an obfuscated string (wopvEaTEcopFEavc) and a key string (iOpvEoeaaeavocp). The code reconstructs a decoded string by XORing each character of the obfuscated payload with a character from the key, then dynamically executes the decoded code using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscated payload reconstruction and dynamic execution during install time is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution without user consent. The obfuscation and silent exception handling (try/except pass) further indicate an attempt to evade detection. The package name 'drfup2qd3k60ne5n' is suspicious and does not correspond to a known legitimate package. Overall, this code abuses the package installation process to execute hidden, arbitrary code, which is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malicious intent."
