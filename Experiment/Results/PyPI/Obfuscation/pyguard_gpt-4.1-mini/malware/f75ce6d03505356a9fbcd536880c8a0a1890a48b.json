      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code collects extensive environment information including the hostname and all environment variables, then encodes this data by percent-encoding non-alphanumeric characters. It then establishes a TCP connection to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain ('packageman.comlu.com') on port 80 and sends this encoded environment data via an HTTP POST request without any user consent or interaction. The obfuscated variable names and silent exception handling further indicate an attempt to evade detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited data exfiltration to a non-standard, suspicious domain during package installation is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically information-stealing or staging malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
