      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently, increasing stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window. Additionally, the malicious code is embedded within a setup script context, which is a common supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. The second try-except block calls setup() with innocuous parameters, likely to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, silent exception handling, and suspicious directory checks strongly indicates malicious intent."
