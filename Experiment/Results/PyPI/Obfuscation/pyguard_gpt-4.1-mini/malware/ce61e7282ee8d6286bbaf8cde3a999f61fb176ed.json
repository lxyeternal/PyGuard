      "malicious_behavior": "The code is a setup script that triggers malicious behavior during package installation or build on Windows platforms. It attempts to ensure the 'pypiwin32' package is installed, then proceeds to create a hidden directory under the user's APPDATA folder named 'Extension'. It writes an obfuscated JavaScript background script and a manifest.json file for a Chrome extension into this directory. The JavaScript code is heavily obfuscated and runs a function every second that manipulates the clipboard content, replacing certain cryptocurrency address patterns with attacker-controlled addresses, effectively hijacking clipboard data. The script then enumerates Windows shortcut (.lnk) files in common user and system startup and desktop paths, and modifies shortcuts to popular browsers (chrome.exe, msedge.exe, brave.exe, launcher.exe) to add a command-line argument that loads the malicious extension from the hidden directory. This behavior is a classic persistence and clipboard hijacking technique used by malware to steal cryptocurrency by replacing copied wallet addresses with attacker addresses. The code also checks for administrative privileges to add persistence in system-wide startup locations. The obfuscation, stealthy installation during package setup, clipboard hijacking, and persistence mechanisms strongly indicate malicious intent."
