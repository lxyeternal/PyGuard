      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses the __pyarmor__ function with a large, obfuscated byte string as an argument. This pattern is strongly indicative of obfuscated or encrypted payloads commonly used by malware to hide malicious code. The use of __pyarmor__ is associated with PyArmor, a tool often used to obfuscate Python scripts, which can be used for legitimate protection but is also frequently abused by malware authors to conceal malicious payloads. Given the extremely large and opaque byte string, it is highly likely that this code decompresses or decrypts and executes hidden malicious code at runtime. This behavior aligns with critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payloads, dynamic code execution, and evasion of static analysis. Without further decoding or deobfuscation, the presence of such an obfuscated payload strongly suggests malicious intent."
