      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method to execute arbitrary code during package installation. Inside this method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution. This execution happens silently during the install process without user consent or interaction, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also specifies Windows-only operation (os.name == 'nt'), which is typical for targeted malware. The setup call includes setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only to facilitate the malicious payload execution. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload, execution at install time, use of cryptography to hide payload, and dynamic code execution via exec()."
