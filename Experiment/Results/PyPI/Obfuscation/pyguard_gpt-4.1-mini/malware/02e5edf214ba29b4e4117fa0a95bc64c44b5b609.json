      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. It first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of obfuscated PowerShell commands executed silently without user consent or notification is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, execution during installation, and lack of user interaction."
