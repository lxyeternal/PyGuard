      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, it performs an HTTP GET request to a URL constructed from obfuscated variable names (the exact URL is not fully visible due to undefined variables, but it appears to be a suspicious or non-standard URL). It then writes the content of the HTTP response to a file named 'qrcodegen.py' and immediately executes this file using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This pattern—downloading code from an external source during package installation and executing it without user consent or validation—is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious behavior. The obfuscation of variable names and the dynamic construction of the URL further suggest an attempt to hide the true intent. There is no error handling, user notification, or validation of the downloaded content, increasing the risk. Executing arbitrary code fetched from the internet during installation can lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment. Therefore, this code is malicious."
