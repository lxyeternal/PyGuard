      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens without any user interaction or consent, and the subprocess is launched with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the code is a standard setup call from distutils.core, which is benign, but the presence of the hidden, encoded PowerShell execution in the installation script is a classic supply chain attack vector. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables arbitrary code execution during package installation, often used to deploy further payloads or establish persistence. Therefore, the code contains malicious behavior."
