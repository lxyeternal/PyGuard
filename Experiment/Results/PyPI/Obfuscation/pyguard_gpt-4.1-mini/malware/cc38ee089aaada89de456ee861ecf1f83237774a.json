      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable directly to disk with a fixed filename ('pics.exe') and then immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen without validation or notification. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The behavior matches a classic remote payload retrieval and execution pattern, which is a strong indicator of malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user-driven workflow justifying this automatic download and execution of an external executable. This pattern is strongly associated with malicious activity, including potential system compromise, persistence, or further payload delivery."
