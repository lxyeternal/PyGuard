      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides a method to execute encrypted and obfuscated code during package installation. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules dynamically only if the OS is Windows ('nt'), then decrypts a hardcoded ciphertext using a hardcoded Fernet key and executes the decrypted payload via exec(). This occurs in the install phase of a setuptools package, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The payload is hidden and encrypted, preventing static analysis and indicating intent to conceal malicious actions. The use of exec() on decrypted data fetched from a hardcoded key and ciphertext is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. The code also requires 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup dependencies, which are likely used by the decrypted payload for network communication or further malicious activity. The obfuscated variable names and lack of legitimate application logic further support malicious intent. Overall, this code exhibits multiple high-risk indicators: encrypted payload execution at install time, dynamic imports of network libraries, obfuscation, and no user consent or transparency, consistent with malware behavior and supply chain attacks."
