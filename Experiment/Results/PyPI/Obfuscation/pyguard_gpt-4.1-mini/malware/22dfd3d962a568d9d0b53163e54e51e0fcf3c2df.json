      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects detailed system information including the stack trace, environment variables, system uname data, and the public IP address of the host. This information is then encoded as JSON and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, obfuscated external URL (decoded from base64 to https://hooks.slack.com/services/...). The code attempts to evade analysis by skipping execution if the hostname or the running script filename matches certain values, which is a common anti-analysis technique. The function and variable names are obfuscated, and the network communication is done without any user interaction or consent. After sending the data, the script prints a message and immediately exits with a non-zero status, which is typical of malware trying to avoid further execution or detection. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL, the unsolicited exfiltration of sensitive system and environment data, and the immediate termination of the program strongly indicate that this code is designed for information stealing and covert data exfiltration, which are malicious behaviors."
