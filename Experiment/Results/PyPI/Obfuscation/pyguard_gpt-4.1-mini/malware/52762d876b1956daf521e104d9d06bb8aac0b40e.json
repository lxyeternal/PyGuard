      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using encoded strings, dynamic eval calls, and base64 decoding combined with custom decoding functions. It dynamically imports standard modules like 'compile', 'exec', 'str.encode', 'isinstance', and 'bytes' via obfuscated means, which is a common evasion technique. The code defines functions that decode and transform data, then executes the decoded payload dynamically using eval. The presence of large base64-encoded and byte-encoded blobs that are decoded and executed at runtime strongly indicates hidden payload execution. The code does not contain any user interaction or legitimate application logic and instead focuses on decoding and executing concealed code. Such patterns—dynamic code execution from obfuscated, encoded data—are hallmark indicators of malicious behavior, often used to hide malware payloads, evade static analysis, and execute arbitrary code on the host system. Therefore, this code is malicious."
