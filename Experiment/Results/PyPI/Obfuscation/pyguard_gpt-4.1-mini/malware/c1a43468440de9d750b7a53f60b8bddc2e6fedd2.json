      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a highly obfuscated payload embedded within a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and malicious package installation. Specifically, it imports base64 and lzma modules to decode and decompress a large base64-encoded, lzma-compressed byte string, then immediately executes the resulting code using exec(compile(...)). This pattern is a critical risk indicator of malware, as it allows arbitrary code execution hidden from static analysis and user inspection. The setup() call includes suspiciously named parameters and dependencies such as 'browser_cookie3', 'requests', 'psutil', 'cryptography', 'httpx', 'pypiwin32', 'dhooks', and 'pycryptodome', which are often used in malicious activities like credential theft, network communication, and persistence. The absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction, combined with the obfuscated payload execution during package installation, strongly indicates malicious intent. This behavior aligns with known supply chain attacks where malicious code is executed at install time without user consent, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further payload deployment."
