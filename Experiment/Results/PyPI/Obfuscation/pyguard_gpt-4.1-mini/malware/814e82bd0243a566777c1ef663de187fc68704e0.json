      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated using hex-encoded strings and dynamic evaluation (eval) of decoded strings, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. The code dynamically imports standard libraries such as 'compile', 'exec', 'str.encode', 'bytes', and 'base64', then defines functions that decode and transform data in a non-transparent manner. The presence of a very large, obfuscated, base64-encoded, and zlib-compressed payload that is decoded and executed dynamically is a hallmark of malware, enabling arbitrary code execution while evading static analysis. The code also uses indirect and obfuscated calls to decode and execute data, which is typical for malware attempting to hide its payload and actions. Given the extensive obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and decoding of large encoded payloads, this code is almost certainly malicious, likely designed to execute hidden payloads, potentially downloading or running further malicious code without user consent."
