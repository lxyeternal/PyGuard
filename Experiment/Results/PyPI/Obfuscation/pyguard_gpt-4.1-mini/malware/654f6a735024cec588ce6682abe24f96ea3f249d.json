      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. It conditionally runs this command only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens during the import and setup phase, without any user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malicious activity, often used for downloading or executing further payloads, persistence, or system compromise. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is overshadowed by the suspicious subprocess call. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
