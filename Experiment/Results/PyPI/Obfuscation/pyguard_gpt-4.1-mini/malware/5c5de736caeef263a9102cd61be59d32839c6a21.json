      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command during the package setup process that uses PowerShell to download an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and saves it to a user directory under the name 'WindowsCache.exe'. Immediately after downloading, it executes this file via Invoke-Expression. This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, as it performs remote payload retrieval and execution without user consent or validation. The use of os.system in setup.py to run such commands is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. The URL is non-standard and points to a file hosting service, which is commonly abused for malware distribution. There is no error handling, user notification, or integrity check on the downloaded file. This behavior is strongly associated with malware and is a critical risk indicator."
