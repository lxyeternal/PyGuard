      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and a hardcoded string, then encodes this information in base64. It then converts this encoded data into a hex-encoded format and sends it in multiple parts via ICMP ping commands to a suspicious, hardcoded domain ('.sub.deliverycontent.online'). Additionally, it attempts multiple HTTP requests (GET and POST) to another hardcoded suspicious domain ('www.deliverycontent.online'), transmitting the encoded system information as part of the URL or POST data. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, uses obfuscated variable names, and performs network communication without any user interaction or consent. These behaviors—system fingerprinting, encoding and exfiltration of sensitive environment data, use of non-standard and suspicious domains, obfuscation, and silent failure handling—are classic hallmarks of malicious code designed for information theft and covert data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious."
