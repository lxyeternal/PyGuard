      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to retrieve a token from the Google Cloud metadata service at the IP 169.254.169.254, which is a well-known internal IP for GCP instance metadata. It then sends this token via an HTTP POST request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://oe6tx4gsvtokjaxyelfy6bjjnat1hr5g.oastify.com/log). This behavior matches a classic pattern of credential or token exfiltration without user consent or notification. The function and variable names are obfuscated, and there is no legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity. The use of a non-standard external domain unrelated to the application purpose, combined with the exfiltration of sensitive tokens, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Additionally, the code lacks proper error handling (e.g., references to undefined variables in exception blocks) which may be an attempt to suppress errors or evade detection. Therefore, this code is performing unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive credentials and is malicious."
