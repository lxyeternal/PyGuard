      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with known malware patterns. It is embedded in a setuptools installation script, which is a common supply chain attack vector allowing code execution during package installation without user consent. The code attempts to enumerate and read all '*.env' files recursively from all drives on Windows or from the user's home directory on other platforms, collecting potentially sensitive environment variables and credentials. It also reads the user's SSH private key (~/.ssh/id_rsa) if it exists. The collected data (environment files content, environment variables, and private key) is base64-encoded and exfiltrated via HTTP GET requests to a hardcoded suspicious command-and-control (C2) server URL ('http://c2server.duckdns.org'). The use of obfuscated variable names, subprocess calls to execute PowerShell commands and curl, silent exception handling, and the absence of any legitimate application logic further confirm malicious intent. This code performs unauthorized data exfiltration of sensitive credentials and environment information to an attacker-controlled server during package installation, a classic hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks."
