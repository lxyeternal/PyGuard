      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a base64 decoding function that decodes an obfuscated shell command string. This decoded command uses 'curl' to silently download a file named 'strings.bat' from a suspicious external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1146199124572639249/1188980936969306164/strings.bat) and saves it to a temporary location. Immediately after downloading, it executes the downloaded batch file using 'start /min cmd /c', which runs the command prompt minimized and executes the batch script. This entire operation is triggered automatically during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools' install command and overriding its run method to call this function. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, the automatic execution of a downloaded script from an external, non-standard domain without user consent, and the execution during package installation are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches known supply chain attack vectors where malicious payloads are fetched and executed during package installation, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise."
