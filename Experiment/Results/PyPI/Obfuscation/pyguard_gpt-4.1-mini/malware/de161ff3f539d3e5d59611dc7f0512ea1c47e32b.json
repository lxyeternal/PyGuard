      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via exec(). The decoded payload itself contains further obfuscation and appears to be a large blob of encoded data that is executed at runtime. This pattern of base64 decoding followed by exec() is a classic hallmark of malicious code designed to evade static analysis and hide its true intent. The code lacks any legitimate application logic or user interaction and instead focuses on decoding and executing hidden payloads. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware, including remote code execution, payload delivery, and potential data exfiltration or system compromise. Given the extensive obfuscation, dynamic execution, and absence of benign context, this code is conclusively malicious."
