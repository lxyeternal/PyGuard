      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or consent, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window, increasing stealth. The rest of the code is a standard setup call from distutils.core, which appears benign but is likely a cover or delivery mechanism. Given these factors, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and execution triggered during package setup, all consistent with malware patterns."
