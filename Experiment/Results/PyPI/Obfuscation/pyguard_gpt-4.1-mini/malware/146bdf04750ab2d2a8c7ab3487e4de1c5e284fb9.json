      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code conditionally executes different payloads based on the operating system, both of which are base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, indicating obfuscation. The Windows branch decodes and executes a large base64-encoded PowerShell command in hidden window mode, a known technique for stealthy execution and evasion. The non-Windows branch decodes and executes a large base64-encoded Python script that performs extensive environment inspection, network communication, dynamic code execution, and likely data exfiltration. The code uses obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, and executes code fetched or constructed at runtime. It also performs operations such as reading system information, sending HTTP requests to suspicious endpoints, and writing or executing files without user consent. These behaviors align with known malware patterns including remote code execution, persistence, information stealing, and evasion techniques. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
