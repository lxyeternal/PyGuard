      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports everything from a relative module named 'src_file' and then calls a function with an obfuscated name 'BLjYHfiqHHwywpomDxBxBcUZfnZbGadr()' without any context or explanation. The use of a relative import with a non-descriptive module name and an obfuscated function name strongly suggests an attempt to hide the true intent of the code. Such obfuscation is a common tactic in malicious code to evade detection and analysis. Without the source of 'src_file', the function call cannot be verified as benign. Given the obfuscation and lack of transparency, this pattern aligns with typical malicious behavior indicators such as hiding intent behind innocuous or random names and executing code without user interaction or consent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It attempts to locate and collect sensitive wallet files from the user's 'exodus' cryptocurrency wallet directory and other user folders (Desktop, Downloads, Documents). It compresses these files into a ZIP archive named with the username and a suspicious pattern. The code then gathers system information such as the current username and public IP address via external HTTP requests. It encodes the country code into regional indicator symbols (emoji flags) and appends this information to a message string. Subsequently, it sends this message and the ZIP archive containing potentially sensitive wallet data to a Telegram bot using hardcoded bot token and chat ID values. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded Telegram bot credentials, silent exception handling, and the exfiltration of sensitive wallet files without user consent are strong indicators of malicious intent. The code also attempts to delete the ZIP archive after sending, indicating anti-forensic behavior. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily steal cryptocurrency wallet data and exfiltrate it to an attacker-controlled Telegram channel, which is a classic form of credential theft malware."
