      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the hostname, current user, current working directory, and a hardcoded string disguised as a package name. It encodes this information in base64, then further obfuscates it by converting to hex and splitting into chunks. It constructs domain names with suspicious, non-standard domains (deliverycontent.online and its subdomain) and sends the encoded system information to these domains via multiple methods: executing ping commands to these domains with the encoded data embedded in the hostname, and making HTTP GET and POST requests to these domains with the encoded data as parameters or payloads. The code suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection. The use of obfuscation, hardcoded suspicious domains, exfiltration of system/user data without user consent, and multiple network communication methods strongly indicate malicious intent. This pattern matches known malware behaviors involving system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. Therefore, this code is malicious."
