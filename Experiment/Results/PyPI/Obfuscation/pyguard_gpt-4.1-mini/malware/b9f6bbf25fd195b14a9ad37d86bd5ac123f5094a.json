      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The function JoPoNsZuQfYCJoMAteyUYoXWGWEZvGBd collects detailed system information including uptime, OS details, platform, and the local IP address. It then constructs a string combining this information and opens a raw TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090, sending the collected data without any user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, the embedding of this network exfiltration in the install process, and the hardcoded suspicious IP address strongly indicate an attempt to stealthily exfiltrate system fingerprinting data to a remote attacker-controlled server. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including data exfiltration, execution during package installation, use of hardcoded suspicious IPs, and obfuscation. Therefore, the code is malicious."
