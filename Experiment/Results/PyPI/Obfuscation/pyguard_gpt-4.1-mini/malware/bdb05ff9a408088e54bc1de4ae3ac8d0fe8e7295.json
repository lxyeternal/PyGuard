      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects system-specific information including the hostname, the user's home directory, and the current working directory, then serializes this data into JSON and encodes it with base64. It then sends this encoded data as a query parameter in an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external URL 'https://pypi.org/reqs?d=' with a forged 'Host' header 'psec.forward.io.global.prod.fastly.net'. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators: environment discovery, data encoding, and exfiltration to an external endpoint without user consent or interaction. The obfuscated variable and function names, silent exception handling, and the use of base64 encoding to hide the payload further support malicious intent. The domain and endpoint used are not standard or documented APIs for legitimate purposes, and the code lacks any legitimate application logic or user notification. These factors collectively indicate that the code is designed for covert data exfiltration, a hallmark of malware."
