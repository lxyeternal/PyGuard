      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The script attempts to import 'requests' and 'subprocess', installing them dynamically if missing, which is suspicious in an installation context. It creates a hidden and suspicious directory 'C:\\$Windows.~SXK' on a Windows system, which is not a standard or benign directory. The script downloads two executable files from hardcoded, non-standard URLs hosted on Discord's CDN, which is unusual and suspicious for legitimate software. These executables are saved with obfuscated names in the hidden directory. The script then immediately executes these downloaded executables using os.startfile without any user consent, validation, or notification. Finally, it attempts to delete the hidden directory, indicating self-cleanup or anti-forensics behavior. The combination of hidden directory creation, downloading executables from suspicious URLs, silent exception handling, immediate execution of downloaded binaries, and cleanup strongly aligns with known malware patterns such as remote payload retrieval, execution, and persistence mechanisms. Therefore, this code is malicious."
