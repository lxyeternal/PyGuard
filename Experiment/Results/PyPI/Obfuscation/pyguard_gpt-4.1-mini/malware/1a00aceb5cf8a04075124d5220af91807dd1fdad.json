      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method that is called during package installation. Inside this method, it checks if the OS is Windows ('nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption with a hardcoded key and ciphertext. This decrypted code is executed via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. The code is embedded in the package installation process (setup.py), which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during install without user consent strongly indicates malicious intent. The presence of 'requests' and 'fernet' in setup_requires suggests these dependencies are used to facilitate the malicious payload execution. The code does not perform any legitimate setup or installation logic visible here and instead executes hidden code on Windows systems during installation. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of cryptography to hide payloads."
