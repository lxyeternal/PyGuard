      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides the install method to perform malicious actions during package installation. It constructs an obfuscated URL by concatenating single-character variables to form a suspicious URL pointing to a Discord CDN domain (discordapp.com) with specific resource IDs. It then uses the requests library (aliased as 'updating') to perform an HTTP GET request to download a Python script named 'qrcodegen.py' from this URL. The downloaded content is written directly to disk without any validation or user consent. Immediately after, the code executes this downloaded script using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter, effectively running arbitrary code fetched from the internet during package installation. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code during install time, combined with obfuscated variable names, lack of error handling, and use of a non-standard external URL, is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware. The code triggers this behavior automatically on installation without user interaction or notification, which is a critical risk and strong indicator of malicious intent."
