      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process. Specifically, it subclasses setuptools.command.install.install and overrides the install command to execute hidden malicious actions during installation on macOS ('darwin' platform). It decodes a base64-encoded shell command ('ioreg -k IOPlatformUUID') to retrieve the system's IOPlatformUUID, then extracts a substring of this UUID and compares it against two hardcoded UUID values. If the UUID matches either of these values, it proceeds to read a PDF file ('static/simple_linear_regression.pdf'), extracts a large slice of its binary content starting at offset 273861, writes this slice as a binary file named 'gomod' in a suspicious temporary directory '/tmp/go-build427292401/exe/', sets executable permissions on this file, and then executes it as a subprocess with all output suppressed. This behavior is indicative of a staged payload delivery and execution mechanism, where a hidden executable payload is extracted from a benign-looking PDF file and run without user consent or notification. The use of obfuscated variable names, base64 decoding, conditional execution based on system UUID, writing and executing a binary in a temporary directory, and suppression of subprocess output are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern aligns with known supply chain attack vectors and post-installation payload execution, which are high-risk and commonly associated with malware. Therefore, the code is malicious."
