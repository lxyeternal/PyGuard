      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install command to execute additional code during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The function KfnAlmHeICsZHjcHbDjNmEFYTUHPDqeK reads the system uptime from /proc/uptime and collects detailed system information including OS release, system name, version, platform, and the local IP address. It then constructs a string combining this information and establishes a raw TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090, sending the collected system information without any user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, the embedding of this behavior in the install process, and the exfiltration of system fingerprinting data to a suspicious hardcoded IP address are all classic hallmarks of malware. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network activity. This pattern is consistent with reconnaissance and data exfiltration typical of malicious packages aiming to gather environment details for further exploitation or command-and-control communication."
