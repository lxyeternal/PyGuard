      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, it downloads a Python script from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://transfer.sh/gDhbfk/qrcodes.py') without any user interaction or validation, writes it to disk as 'qrcodes.py', and immediately executes it using subprocess.check_call with the current Python interpreter. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary remote code execution during package installation. The obfuscated class and method names further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The downloaded script is executed without any integrity checks or user consent, which is a critical security risk. This pattern is strongly associated with malware, as it enables attackers to deliver and run arbitrary payloads on the victim's system during a trusted package installation process."
