      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The script downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://cdn-1.thughunter.repl.co/cdn/Windows.exe) without any user interaction, validation, or notification. It writes this executable to a temporary file and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote binary during package installation is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of obfuscated variable names and the absence of error handling or logging further support the malicious intent. The behavior aligns with critical risk patterns such as remote payload retrieval, arbitrary code execution at install time, and execution of untrusted code from the internet, all without user consent or safeguards."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://cdn-1.thughunter.repl.co/cdn/Windows.exe) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It writes the downloaded content directly to a temporary file with a randomized name and immediately executes it using subprocess.call. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The absence of error handling, user notification, or integrity checks, combined with the use of a non-standard, suspicious domain and direct execution of the downloaded binary, strongly indicates malicious intent."
