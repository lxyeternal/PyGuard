      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It embeds a base64-encoded shell command that is executed during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). This command uses pip to install the 'requests' and 'subprocess' modules, then downloads an executable file named 'ip_checker.exe' from a hardcoded suspicious GitHub raw URL (https://github.com/Exet75/neofetch/blob/main/ip_checker.exe?raw=true), writes it to disk, and executes it. The use of base64 encoding to hide the shell command, execution of shell commands during installation without user consent, downloading and running an executable from an external source, and the lack of any legitimate application logic or user interaction are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and payload delivery during package installation, which is a critical risk behavior consistently associated with malware."
