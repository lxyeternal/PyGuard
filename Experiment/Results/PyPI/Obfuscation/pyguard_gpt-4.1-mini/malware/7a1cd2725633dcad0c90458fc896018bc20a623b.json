      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Inside the overridden install method, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed dynamically via exec(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary code execution. The payload is embedded in the install script and runs automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated variable names and encrypted payload hides the true intent, which is typical of malware. The presence of network-related modules (requests) and cryptography (fernet) in this context strongly suggests the payload may perform network communication or further malicious actions. This pattern matches multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators for malicious code, including execution of decrypted code at install time, obfuscation, and abuse of the package installation process for remote code execution."
