      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses a combination of base64 decoding and marshal.loads to dynamically reconstruct and execute Python bytecode. This technique is a classic hallmark of malicious code aiming to evade static analysis and hide its true intent. The embedded base64 string decodes to marshaled bytecode, which is then executed with exec(), allowing arbitrary code execution. Such behavior is strongly associated with malware, as it enables attackers to conceal payloads, perform unauthorized actions, download or execute further malicious code, or exfiltrate data without user consent. The absence of any legitimate application logic, combined with the use of dynamic code execution on obfuscated data, confirms that this code contains malicious behavior."
