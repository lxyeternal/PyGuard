      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a function that checks if the platform is Linux and then executes a shell command via os.system without user consent or validation. This shell command downloads and executes a script from a suspicious, hardcoded URL ('gsocket.io/x') using curl and bash, redirecting output to /dev/null, which is a classic pattern for remote code execution and payload delivery. The function is called during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools' install command, ensuring the malicious payload is executed automatically when the package is installed. The use of obfuscated function and variable names, absence of error handling, and execution of remote code during installation without user interaction are strong indicators of a supply chain attack vector. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, fetching and running untrusted code from a hardcoded external URL, and embedding malicious actions in the package setup process."
