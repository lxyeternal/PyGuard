      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, but this part appears benign or a cover for the malicious payload. Overall, the presence of hidden, encoded PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with no legitimate purpose or user consent, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with malware delivery, stealth execution, and potential further payload deployment."
