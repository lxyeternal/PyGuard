      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides a method to execute encrypted and obfuscated code during package installation. Specifically, in the overridden method XhcUrOMPuKqfpHMxjXfxdQtqQgEwxsRR, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed via exec(), which allows arbitrary code execution. This behavior occurs during the installation process (setup.py install hook), without user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time are strong indicators of malicious intent. The code also declares dependencies on 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this malicious payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or documentation explaining the cryptography or network activity. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution from obfuscated payloads during package installation, use of encryption to hide payload, and execution of code without user consent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
