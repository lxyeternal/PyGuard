      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The subprocess call uses CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, but no legitimate package logic, suggesting the main purpose is to trigger the hidden PowerShell execution. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent or transparency."
