      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then runs this hidden PowerShell command, which suggests conditional execution to evade analysis or target specific environments. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the lack of user interaction, error handling, or legitimate application logic, strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, execution during installation, and use of encoded PowerShell commands."
