      "malicious_behavior": "The code is embedded in a setuptools install subclass, which triggers execution during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. It collects system information such as the current working directory name, platform details, the current username (via 'whoami'), and the user's home directory. It then constructs and sends HTTP GET requests to a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://3.221.152.203:8000) with this collected data embedded in the URL path. The use of os.popen to execute shell commands without validation, combined with network exfiltration of system and user information during installation without user consent, is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscated function and variable names, absence of legitimate application logic, and the silent, automatic data exfiltration during install confirm this is malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing or reconnaissance malware."
