      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' and only then runs this hidden PowerShell command, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure environment suitability. This behavior is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation without user consent. The use of subprocess with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further suppresses any visible window, enhancing stealth. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but does not mitigate the malicious payload execution. These factors combined—hidden execution, encoded PowerShell payload, conditional directory check, and execution during setup—are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with known malware patterns."
