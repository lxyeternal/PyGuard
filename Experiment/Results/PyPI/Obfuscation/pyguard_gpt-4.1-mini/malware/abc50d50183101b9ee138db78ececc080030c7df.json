      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using hex-encoded strings, dynamic eval calls, and indirect imports. It decodes and executes base64-encoded and compressed data dynamically, which is a classic technique used to hide malicious payloads. The code reconstructs and executes code at runtime without any user interaction or consent, indicating arbitrary code execution. The use of eval on dynamically decoded and decompressed data is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of hidden payloads that evade static analysis. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns match multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including payload obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and lack of transparency. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL to which it sends a notification message indicating that a package has been installed. This outbound network communication to a hardcoded external endpoint without user interaction or consent is a strong indicator of malicious behavior, especially in the context of a package installation or setup script. The function name and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide intent. The code silently sends data about the installed package to an external server, which can be used for unauthorized tracking or data exfiltration. Additionally, the code exits with an error if the HTTP status is not 204, indicating it expects successful delivery of this notification, further suggesting that this network call is critical to its operation. Such unsolicited data transmission to a hardcoded external webhook is a hallmark of supply chain attacks or malware embedded in installation scripts."

It dynamically imports critical functions like eval and compile, decodes and decompresses base64-encoded data, and executes it at runtime. The code constructs and executes shell commands dynamically, uses base64 decoding, and performs multiple layers of decoding and decompression before executing code. Such behavior is typical of malware that hides its payload to evade static analysis. The code also appears to perform environment fingerprinting and data encoding, which are common in information-stealing or staging malware. The obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and decoding of embedded payloads strongly indicate that this code is designed to execute arbitrary, potentially harmful code without user consent, fitting multiple critical risk patterns associated with malware."

This outbound network communication occurs without any user interaction or consent, and the webhook URL is hardcoded and external, which is a strong indicator of data exfiltration or unauthorized notification. The function name and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The code sends a POST request with JSON content to an external endpoint immediately upon execution, which is typical of malware that reports installation or usage to a command-and-control server. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification justifying this network activity. These factors combined align with known malicious patterns such as unsolicited data exfiltration, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, obfuscation, and execution during package installation or setup, all of which are strong indicators of malicious behavior."
