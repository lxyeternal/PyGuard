      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools' install command that executes during package installation without user consent. It collects sensitive environment information such as hostname, current working directory, and username. It attempts to create a file in /root, then enumerates directories including /run/, /etc/, /home/, /mnt/, and /rasp/, which are sensitive system and user directories. The collected directory listings are sent via HTTP POST requests to a suspicious, hardcoded external domain (https://j0j0.xyz) with URLs constructed from the hostname and username, indicating system fingerprinting and data exfiltration. Furthermore, the code attempts to read and exfiltrate potentially sensitive files related to Docker and wget history from root directories, again sending their contents to the same external server. This behavior is consistent with malicious data exfiltration and reconnaissance. The use of obfuscated class and method names, silent exception handling, and embedding this logic in the install command of a Python package setup script strongly indicates a supply chain attack vector. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the external domain is not a known trusted source. All these factors combined classify this code as malicious."
