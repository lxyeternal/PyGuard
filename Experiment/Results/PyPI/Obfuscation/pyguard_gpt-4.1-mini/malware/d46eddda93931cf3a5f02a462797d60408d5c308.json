      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides a method to execute arbitrary code during package installation without user consent. Specifically, it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This decrypted payload is not visible in the code, indicating obfuscation and hiding of true intent. The execution is conditional on the OS being Windows (os.name == 'nt'), suggesting targeted behavior. The code is embedded in the setup.py install hook, a known supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution at install time. The use of encrypted payloads, dynamic execution, and network-related modules (requests) strongly indicates malicious intent, consistent with typical malware patterns such as arbitrary code execution, obfuscation, and stealthy payload delivery during package installation."
