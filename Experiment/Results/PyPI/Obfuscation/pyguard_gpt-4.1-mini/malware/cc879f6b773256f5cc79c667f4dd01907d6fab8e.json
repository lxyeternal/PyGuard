      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the hostname, current user, and current working directory, then encodes this information in base64. It then constructs obfuscated strings by hex-encoding parts of this data combined with random values and appends a suspicious domain suffix ('.sub.deliverycontent.online'). The code proceeds to execute multiple 'ping' commands to these constructed domain names, which is unusual and likely a covert channel or beaconing technique. Subsequently, it attempts multiple HTTP requests (GET and POST) to hardcoded suspicious domains ('www.deliverycontent.online') with the encoded system information as payload, using various libraries (urllib.request, requests, urllib) and suppressing all exceptions silently. The obfuscation, lack of user interaction or consent, use of hardcoded suspicious external domains, encoding of system-specific data, and network communication to these domains strongly indicate data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The code also uses randomization and hex encoding to evade detection. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including environment fingerprinting, data encoding and exfiltration, obfuscation, and unsolicited network communication to suspicious domains. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
