      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install process. During installation, it downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://cdn-141.anonfiles.com/scUeHf23z5/cfc2b34c-1689619361/payload.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It saves this file locally using the basename of the URL and then immediately executes it using os.system. This pattern of downloading and executing an external executable during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and is strongly associated with malware. The obfuscated function and class names, lack of validation or integrity checks on the downloaded file, absence of user notification, and execution of potentially untrusted code during install time confirm the malicious intent. This behavior enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system without their knowledge, posing a critical security risk."
