      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically fetches and executes Python code from a hardcoded, suspicious external URL ('http://files.inostage.ru/version/check/a') without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It uses exec() on the content retrieved via requests.get(), which is a critical red flag for arbitrary remote code execution. The use of socket.gethostname() to gather system information and the immediate execution of remote code strongly indicate malicious intent, as this pattern is commonly used for remote payload retrieval and execution, a hallmark of malware. The code lacks any legitimate application logic, error handling, or transparency, and the domain used is not a known trusted source. This behavior aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including dynamic code execution from untrusted sources, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and absence of user consent or validation."
