      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded within a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The code conditionally executes different base64-decoded payloads depending on the operating system, both of which are heavily obfuscated. The Windows branch decodes and executes a large base64-encoded string that writes and runs an executable from a suspicious path, indicating persistence or payload deployment. The non-Windows branch similarly decodes and executes a base64-encoded payload that performs network communication, environment fingerprinting, and likely remote code execution. The code performs environment discovery, reads sensitive data, and sends it to hardcoded external endpoints, which is typical of data exfiltration malware. It also uses dynamic code execution (exec on decoded data), writes files to disk without validation, and runs shell commands, all without user consent or interaction. The presence of obfuscated network requests, environment variable access, and execution of downloaded or decoded code during package installation strongly indicates this is a malicious package designed for remote access, data theft, or further payload delivery."
