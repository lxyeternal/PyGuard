      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom setuptools install command (AfterInstall) that runs a function (notmalfunc) immediately after installation. This function executes a shell command via os.system on a base64-decoded string. The base64 string is obfuscated and replaced with 'CODE_REPLACE' in the snippet, but the pattern of decoding base64 data and executing it as a shell command during package installation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. Executing arbitrary shell commands during package installation without user consent is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of base64 encoding to hide the actual command further indicates an attempt to evade detection and analysis. This pattern aligns with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and execution of decoded payloads. Therefore, this code is malicious."
