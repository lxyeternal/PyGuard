      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is highly obfuscated and uses a combination of base64 decoding and marshal.loads to dynamically reconstruct and execute Python bytecode. This technique is a classic hallmark of malicious code aiming to evade static analysis and hide its true intent. The encoded payload likely contains further instructions that are executed immediately without user consent or interaction. The use of marshal.loads on decoded base64 data is a strong indicator of arbitrary code execution from an obfuscated source, which is a critical risk pattern exclusively associated with malware. Given the obfuscation, lack of transparency, and dynamic execution, this code is almost certainly malicious."
