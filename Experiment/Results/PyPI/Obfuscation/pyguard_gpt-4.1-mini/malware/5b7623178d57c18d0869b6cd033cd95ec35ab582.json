      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. It conditionally runs this command only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, which suggests staging or persistence behavior. This execution happens immediately upon import or setup, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. These patterns—hidden PowerShell execution with encoded commands during package setup, obfuscation, conditional execution based on file existence, and suppression of errors—are strongly associated with malware and supply chain attacks. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
