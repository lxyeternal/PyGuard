      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is highly obfuscated and contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded within a setup script, which triggers execution during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The code uses base64 decoding and exec to run hidden payloads, including a large base64-encoded block that is decoded and executed only on Windows ('nt' platform). This payload writes a binary executable to a temporary directory with a suspicious filename and executes it in a hidden window, a classic technique for stealthy malware deployment. For non-Windows systems, it decodes and executes another large base64-encoded payload that performs environment reconnaissance, collects system and user information, and sends it to suspicious external endpoints. The code dynamically imports modules, performs network communication to hardcoded suspicious URLs, and executes shell commands without user consent or validation. It also uses obfuscation techniques such as zlib decompression, eval on reconstructed code, and encoded HTTP requests. These behaviors align with known malware patterns including remote code execution, data exfiltration, persistence mechanisms, and evasion of static analysis. Therefore, this code is malicious and poses a significant security risk."
