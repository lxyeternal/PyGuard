      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The use of subprocess.Popen to run an encoded PowerShell command without user interaction or consent, combined with obfuscation and hidden execution, is a hallmark of malware. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The setup call itself appears benign but is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious payload execution. Overall, this code matches multiple critical risk patterns including hidden process execution, obfuscated payload delivery, and execution during package installation, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
