      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call from distutils.core, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a package installation script. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package installation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
