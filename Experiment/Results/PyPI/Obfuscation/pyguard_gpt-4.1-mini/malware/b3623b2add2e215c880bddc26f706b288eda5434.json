      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which triggers execution of the function LubXuzuKJfaqkbYArlioXYmCUGTPZvNP() during package installation without user consent. This function collects detailed system information including uptime, OS details, platform, and the local IP address. It then constructs a string combining this information and establishes a raw TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 9090. The collected system information is sent directly over this socket. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with unsolicited outbound network communication to a hardcoded IP during package installation is a classic hallmark of supply chain attacks and information-stealing malware. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, lacks any legitimate application logic or user interaction, and performs network exfiltration immediately upon installation. There is no error handling or logging, and the use of a raw socket connection to a suspicious IP address further elevates the risk. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malicious code, including exfiltration of sensitive system data, execution of code during package installation, use of hardcoded suspicious IP addresses, and absence of legitimate business logic. Therefore, this code is malicious."
