      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup() call from distutils.core, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution in the same script strongly suggests malicious intent. The combination of obfuscated, hidden command execution during package setup, use of encoded PowerShell commands, and suppression of exceptions aligns with multiple critical risk patterns for malware, including stealthy payload execution, evasion, and potential persistence or further payload delivery."
