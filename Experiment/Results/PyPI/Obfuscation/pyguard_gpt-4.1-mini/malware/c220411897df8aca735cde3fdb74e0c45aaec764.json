      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and uses non-ASCII variable names and complex expressions to hide its intent. It dynamically constructs strings and imports modules in an indirect manner. The code triggers on specific command-line arguments and performs actions such as importing 'pip' to run commands, importing 'win32com' and 'ctypes' for Windows COM automation and privilege checks, creating directories and files in user-specific or hidden paths, enumerating files in directories, creating Windows shortcuts, and writing to files in user directories. It also checks for administrative privileges and attempts to escalate or persist. The obfuscation, dynamic imports, file system manipulations in user directories, creation of shortcuts, and conditional execution based on command-line arguments strongly indicate malicious behavior. The code appears to be designed to execute during package setup (setup call at the end), which is a known supply chain attack vector. These behaviors align with multiple high-risk and critical-risk indicators of malware, including persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation attempts, and obfuscated payload deployment. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
