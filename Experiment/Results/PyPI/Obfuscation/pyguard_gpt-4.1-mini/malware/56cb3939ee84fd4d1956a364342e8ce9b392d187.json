      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious SMS bomber tool designed to send large volumes of SMS messages (often OTPs) to specified phone numbers without consent. It uses the 'requests' library to send HTTP POST requests to multiple third-party APIs and services that trigger SMS OTPs to the target numbers. The code includes obfuscated variable names and numerous try-except blocks to suppress errors, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. It fetches remote configuration and protected number lists from suspicious GitHub URLs, uses UUIDs for device identification, and forcibly exits if the device is not approved, indicating control by a remote operator. The tool automates spamming of SMS OTPs to multiple services, which is abusive and malicious behavior. Additionally, it opens social media URLs likely for promotion or distraction. The code lacks legitimate application logic, user consent, or ethical use cases, and its primary function is to harass or disrupt via SMS flooding. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "is_malicious": true,
      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to import a module named 'bomber' and if that fails, it runs a shell command to install a package named 'haxorsiambot' using pip. The package name 'haxorsiambot' is suspicious and likely a typo or obfuscated name designed to evade detection (typosquatting). The code then calls a function with an obfuscated name 'vSGofgdxbvUaSWnoEUnTHwyhvRiIPxpR' from the 'bomber' module without any user interaction or consent. This pattern of dynamic import, silent installation of a potentially malicious package, and execution of an obfuscated function is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The code suppresses exceptions silently and does not provide any legitimate application logic or user notification. The use of obfuscated names, dynamic installation of a suspicious package, and immediate execution of an unknown function strongly suggests this code is designed to execute malicious payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the host system."
