      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install and overrides a method that is presumably intended to run during package installation. Inside this method, it constructs a shell command that creates a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded IP address (121.4.154.240) on port 4501. The command uses Python to open a socket, connect to the remote IP, duplicate the socket file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr, disables shell history, and spawns a bash shell. This command is base64-encoded and then decoded and executed via os.system with bash. This behavior is a classic reverse shell payload embedded in a package installation script, which will execute without user consent during installation, allowing an attacker remote command execution on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), hardcoded suspicious IP, execution during install, and spawning a remote shell are all strong indicators of malicious intent and align with multiple critical risk patterns for malware."
