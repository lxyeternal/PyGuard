      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with hidden window style and encoded PowerShell commands is a hallmark of malware aiming to execute arbitrary code stealthily. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of these factors—hidden execution, obfuscated payload, conditional execution based on directory presence, and embedding in setup—strongly indicates malicious behavior."
