      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup.py installation script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. During the install command, it downloads an executable file named 'pics.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe') without any user consent or validation. It then attempts to execute this downloaded file using subprocess.Popen, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. The use of the requests library to fetch an executable and immediate execution of that executable during package installation is a classic pattern of malware delivery and execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying these actions. These behaviors align with critical risk patterns such as remote payload retrieval, execution during package installation, obfuscation, and lack of user consent, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file named 'pics.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on GitHub user content (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IncsecRishie/wdwddwdw/main/pics.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable directly to disk and then immediately executes it using subprocess.Popen. The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before downloading and executing the file. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable without user consent is a classic hallmark of malware, often used for payload delivery, persistence, or further compromise. The absence of any legitimate application logic or user interaction, combined with the direct execution of a downloaded executable, strongly indicates malicious behavior."
