      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically at runtime using exec and compile. This payload imports modules like tempfile, sys, and os, then writes to a temporary file a Python script that imports urllib.request and executes code fetched from a suspicious hardcoded URL: 'https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/hzzzp/raw'. The temporary file is then executed via the system module. This pattern of decoding and executing obfuscated code during package setup, fetching and running remote code without user consent, and using temporary files for execution is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, specifically a supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and network retrieval of executable code without validation or user interaction strongly indicates malicious intent."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed immediately at runtime using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules to perform a network request to a suspicious hardcoded URL ('https://rentry.co/7nqxy/raw'), reads the response, writes it to a temporary file, and then executes it via a shell command. This sequence of actions—downloading code from an external, non-standard URL, writing it to disk without validation or user consent, and executing it—is a classic pattern of remote code execution and payload delivery used by malware. Additionally, the code uses obfuscated class and function names, indirect imports, and system calls to hide its behavior. The presence of these factors, combined with the lack of legitimate application logic or user interaction, confirms that the code exhibits malicious behavior."
