      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function that executes a shell command via os.system to open a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded external IP address (81.46.246.181) on port 4444 using bash. This reverse shell command allows an attacker to gain remote command execution on the victim's machine without user interaction or consent. The function is called immediately during the package setup process, meaning the malicious payload executes automatically when the package is installed. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell payload, enabling unauthorized remote control of the host. The use of a hardcoded IP address, execution of a shell command during installation, and lack of any legitimate application logic or user notification are strong indicators of malicious intent."
