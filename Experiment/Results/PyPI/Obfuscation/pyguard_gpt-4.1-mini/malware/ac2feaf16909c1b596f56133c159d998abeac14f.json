      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive user information from Discord's API using an authorization token, including username, user ID, email, phone number, friends, servers, and DM channels. This data is then exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to hardcoded, base64-encoded external URLs that decode to suspicious Discord webhook endpoints and other non-standard domains. The use of obfuscated variable names and base64 encoding to hide URLs and payloads is a common evasion technique. The function hNGMlOXNuQXCnQIAEaNOAFSizedtiXAe sends detailed user information to an external webhook without user consent or notification, indicating data theft. Additionally, the code spawns threads to perform these exfiltration tasks asynchronously, which is typical for malware to evade detection. The presence of network communication libraries (requests), obfuscated code, hardcoded suspicious URLs, and unsolicited collection and transmission of sensitive user data to external endpoints collectively confirm malicious intent."
