      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is typical for PowerShell encoded commands used to evade detection. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently. The code also checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common evasion or staging technique. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of encoded PowerShell commands, silent exception handling, and execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
