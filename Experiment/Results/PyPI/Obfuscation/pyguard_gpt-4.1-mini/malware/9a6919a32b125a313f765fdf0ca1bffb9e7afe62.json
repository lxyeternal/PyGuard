      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setuptools installation script, which triggers execution during package installation without user consent, a common supply chain attack vector. The code attempts to enumerate and read all '*.env' files recursively on all drives (Windows) or the user's home directory (non-Windows), which likely contain sensitive environment variables such as credentials or API keys. It also reads the user's SSH private key (~/.ssh/id_rsa) if it exists. Both the collected environment file contents and environment variables, as well as the private SSH key, are base64-encoded and exfiltrated via HTTP GET requests to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://65.1.221.11:1337/), which is not associated with any legitimate service. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. It uses subprocess calls to execute PowerShell commands on Windows to find files, and 'find' commands on Unix-like systems, indicating cross-platform credential harvesting. The exfiltration is done silently during the install command, leveraging setuptools command subclassing, which is a known malicious pattern. The overall behavior is consistent with information-stealing malware designed to harvest sensitive credentials and environment data and send them to an attacker-controlled server without user knowledge or consent."
