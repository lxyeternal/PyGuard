      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or detection. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without any user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, which is typical in malicious packages to disguise payload delivery. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload execution, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent or notification. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
