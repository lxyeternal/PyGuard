      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install command, which is a known vector for executing code during package installation without user consent. Inside the overridden method, it sets an environment variable, imports the git module, and constructs paths inside the Windows user's Start Menu Programs directory, specifically targeting the Startup folder and another folder named 'Powerpoint'. It creates these directories if they do not exist, which is a common persistence technique. Then, it clones two GitHub repositories ('https://github.com/dcsage/test2lmaos.git' and 'https://github.com/dcsage/defonotagrabber.git') into these directories. After cloning, it renames a file 'test.py' from the cloned 'test2lmaos' repository inside the Startup boot folder to the Startup folder itself, effectively placing a Python script in the Windows startup folder to be executed on user login, which is a persistence mechanism. This entire sequence happens automatically during package installation, without any user interaction or notification. The use of obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded suspicious external URLs, writing to Windows startup folders, cloning potentially untrusted code, and setting up persistence mechanisms are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including execution of arbitrary code during installation, persistence via startup folder modification, and fetching and deploying remote code from suspicious repositories."
