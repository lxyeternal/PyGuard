      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior. First, it contains obfuscated code that dynamically reconstructs and evaluates a string via eval(), which is a classic technique for hiding malicious payloads and enabling arbitrary code execution. Second, the code uses the setuptools setup script context to execute a shell command that downloads a shell script from a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://github.com/nedog123/files/raw/main/seo.sh) into the /tmp directory, makes it executable, and immediately runs it. This download-and-execute pattern without user consent or validation is a hallmark of malware and supply chain attacks. The obfuscation of variable and function names further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The use of eval on dynamically decoded data combined with immediate execution of a downloaded script during package setup strongly confirms malicious intent. This behavior aligns with critical risk patterns such as arbitrary code execution at install time, remote payload retrieval, and execution without user interaction, all of which are typical of malware and supply chain attacks."
