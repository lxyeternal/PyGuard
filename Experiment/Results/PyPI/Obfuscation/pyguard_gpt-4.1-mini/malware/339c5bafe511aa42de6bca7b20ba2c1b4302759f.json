      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The use of distutils.core.setup with a suspicious package name and version alongside this hidden execution further suggests a supply chain attack vector or malicious package installation behavior. The subprocess call includes creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, increasing stealth. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which is typical in malware to avoid detection. Overall, these behaviors align strongly with known malicious patterns such as stealthy payload execution, obfuscation, and abuse of installation scripts for unauthorized code execution."
