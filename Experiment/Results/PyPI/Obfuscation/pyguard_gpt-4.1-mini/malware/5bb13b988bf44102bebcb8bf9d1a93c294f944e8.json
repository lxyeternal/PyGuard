      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a shell script from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://fhost.devxops.eu.org/devops/cicd/scripts/dh-storage-v1.1.sh) directly into the user's home directory without any validation or user consent. It then sets executable permissions on this script and executes it with specific arguments using subprocess. Additionally, it runs system commands to update package lists and install tmux without user interaction. This pattern of downloading and executing remote code silently, combined with execution of shell commands and writing executable files to user directories, is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, often used for remote payload retrieval, persistence, or further compromise. The use of a non-standard, suspicious domain and lack of error handling or user notification further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."
