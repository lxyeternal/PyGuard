      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded in the setup script. After the legitimate setup() call, it attempts to collect environment information including the current working directory's last path component, the current user's username, and the hostname. It then constructs a string combining these pieces of information and applies a simple XOR obfuscation with a fixed key. This obfuscated data is base64-encoded and sent as part of a crafted HTTP GET request to a hardcoded remote server. The remote server's address is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, and the connection is made to a non-standard port (octal 017620 = decimal 7904). The code suppresses all exceptions silently, indicating an attempt to evade detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert network communication to a hardcoded external IP/domain, obfuscation of data, and execution during package installation is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically information-stealing or staging malware. The malicious code is hidden in the setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector, enabling execution without user consent during package installation."
