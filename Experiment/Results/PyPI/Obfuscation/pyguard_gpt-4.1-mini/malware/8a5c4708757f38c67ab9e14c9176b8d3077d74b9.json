      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file ('trex.exe') from a hardcoded, external URL hosted on Discord's CDN, saves it locally as 'launcher.exe', executes it immediately using os.system, and then deletes the file. This pattern matches a classic malware behavior of remote payload retrieval and execution without any user interaction, validation, or consent. The use of a hardcoded suspicious URL to fetch an executable, immediate execution of the downloaded file, and subsequent deletion (self-deleting behavior) are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or error handling surrounding these actions, and the code effectively acts as a dropper or downloader for potentially harmful payloads."
