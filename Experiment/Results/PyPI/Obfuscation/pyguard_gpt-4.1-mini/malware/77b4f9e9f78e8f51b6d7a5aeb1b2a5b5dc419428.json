      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during install time strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the setup script requires 'fernet' and 'requests' packages, which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code execution at install time, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and lack of legitimate application logic surrounding the network or execution actions."
