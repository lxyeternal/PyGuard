      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and zlib compression, which is a common evasion technique. The code collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, browser cookies, passwords, and system information (HWID, IP, MAC address, username, hostname). It decrypts protected data using Windows DPAPI and AES, accesses various browser and Discord directories, and extracts credentials and tokens. The data is then exfiltrated to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and external URLs. The code also kills processes related to Discord to avoid detection and copies itself to hidden directories for persistence. It uses threading to perform concurrent data collection and exfiltration. The presence of a setup() call with obfuscated payload execution during installation suggests a supply chain attack vector. The code performs network communication without user consent, writes files to user directories, and executes shell commands to maintain persistence and evade detection. All these behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as credential theft, data exfiltration, and stealthy persistence mechanisms."
