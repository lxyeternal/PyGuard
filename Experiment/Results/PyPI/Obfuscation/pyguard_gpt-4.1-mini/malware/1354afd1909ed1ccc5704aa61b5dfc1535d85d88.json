      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process to execute encrypted and obfuscated code at install time without user consent. Specifically, during installation on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution in the install hook strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also requires 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup dependencies, likely to support the malicious payload's network communication or further actions. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the payload is executed silently during installation, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
