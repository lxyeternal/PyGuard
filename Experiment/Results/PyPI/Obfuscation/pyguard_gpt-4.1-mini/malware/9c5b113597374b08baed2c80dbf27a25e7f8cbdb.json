      "malicious_behavior": "The code is heavily obfuscated and uses a long XOR-based decoding routine to reconstruct a string that is then executed dynamically using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscation and dynamic code execution is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it is commonly used to hide the true payload and evade static analysis. The variable names are nonsensical and the encoded string is large and unreadable, which is typical for malware trying to conceal its behavior. The final step executes the decoded payload without any user interaction or validation, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware. Given the absence of any legitimate application logic, the use of obfuscation, and dynamic execution of reconstructed code, this script is almost certainly malicious."
