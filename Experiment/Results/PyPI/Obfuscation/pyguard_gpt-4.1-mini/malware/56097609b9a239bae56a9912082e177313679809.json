      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method that decrypts and executes an encrypted payload at install time without user consent. Specifically, during installation on Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted byte string and executes the decrypted code via exec(). This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution in the install hook strongly indicates malicious intent. The package setup specifies 'setup_requires' for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code executes arbitrary decrypted code silently during installation, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
