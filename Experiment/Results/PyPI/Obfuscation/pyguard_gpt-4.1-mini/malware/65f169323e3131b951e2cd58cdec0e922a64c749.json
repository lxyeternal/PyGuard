      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It installs numerous third-party packages without user consent, including libraries commonly used for network communication, clipboard access, cryptography, and Windows registry manipulation. The code contains obfuscated variable and function names, making analysis difficult and indicating intent to evade detection. It accesses environment variables to locate user directories (e.g., LOCALAPPDATA, APPDATA, TEMP) and system information (username, computer name, hardware info). It reads and decrypts sensitive data such as browser passwords, cookies, history, Discord tokens, and other credentials from multiple browsers and applications by accessing their local storage and decrypting encrypted keys using Windows DPAPI. The code performs clipboard hijacking by monitoring clipboard content and replacing cryptocurrency addresses with attacker-controlled addresses, a known theft technique. It collects detailed system and network information, including IP geolocation, and sends this data along with stolen credentials and files to a hardcoded external webhook URL (https://kekwltd.ru/relay), indicating data exfiltration. It attempts to disable or kill Discord-related processes and modifies startup folders for persistence. The code uses threading and asynchronous calls to run these malicious tasks stealthily in the background. It also deletes traces and temporary files to evade forensic analysis. The presence of cryptographic decryption, environment fingerprinting, credential harvesting, clipboard manipulation, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration to suspicious external endpoints conclusively classifies this code as malicious malware designed to steal sensitive user information and cryptocurrency assets."
