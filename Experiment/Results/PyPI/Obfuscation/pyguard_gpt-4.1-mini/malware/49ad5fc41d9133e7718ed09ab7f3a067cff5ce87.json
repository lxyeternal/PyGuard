      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic and suspicious package metadata, likely to disguise the malicious intent. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with no legitimate application logic or user consent, is a strong indicator of malicious behavior consistent with malware delivery, stealthy payload execution, and potential system compromise."
