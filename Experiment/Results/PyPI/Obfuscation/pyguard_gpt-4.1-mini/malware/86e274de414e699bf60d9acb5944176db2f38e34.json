      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which executes multiple os.system shell commands during package installation without user consent or interaction. It installs the 'requests' package dynamically, then performs HTTP GET requests to multiple hardcoded, suspicious URLs (e.g., 'https://chef.csa.eyrie.cloud/chef/validation.pem' and URLs constructed from environment variables like 'EL_FAAS_PORT_9000_TCP_ADDR' and 'EL_FAAS_SERVICE_HOST') with a hardcoded Proxy-Authorization header containing a base64-encoded credential. The responses from these requests are appended to a LICENSE file, which is unusual and suspicious behavior. The code unsets proxy environment variables before some requests, indicating an attempt to bypass proxy settings. The use of obfuscated variable names, hardcoded suspicious URLs, execution of shell commands during installation, network communication to external and environment-derived endpoints, and writing of fetched data to files without validation or user notification are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for supply chain attacks and remote code execution during package installation, a known malware vector. The code also creates a temporary file '/tmp/pytest2' without clear purpose, further indicating suspicious activity. Overall, the code abuses the package installation process to perform unauthorized network communication and file manipulation, consistent with malicious behavior."
