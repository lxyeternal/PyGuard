      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides the install method to execute additional code during package installation. This code collects extensive system information including OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, network configuration ('ifconfig' or 'ipconfig'), username ('whoami'), hostname, and public IP address (via HTTP GET to 'http://ifconfig.me'). It then constructs a JSON payload containing this sensitive system information and sends it via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive system information without user consent. The code is embedded in the package installation process, which means it executes automatically when the package is installed, a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names and the hardcoded external webhook URL further indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this data exfiltration. Therefore, this code exhibits clear malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware."
