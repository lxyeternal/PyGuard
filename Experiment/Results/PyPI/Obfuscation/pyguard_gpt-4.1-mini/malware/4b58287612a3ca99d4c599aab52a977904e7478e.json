      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using hexadecimal escape sequences and dynamic evaluation (eval) of reconstructed strings, which is a common technique to hide malicious intent. It imports and uses base64 decoding, zlib decompression, and dynamic execution of decoded data, which strongly indicates that it is decoding and executing hidden payloads at runtime. The code constructs and executes functions that decode and decompress data, then eval or exec the resulting code, a hallmark of malware that attempts to evade static analysis. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns, combined with the absence of legitimate application logic or user interaction, are consistent with malicious behavior such as remote code execution, payload delivery, or information exfiltration. Therefore, this code should be classified as malicious."
