      "malicious_behavior": "The code dynamically fetches Python code from a hardcoded, non-standard external URL ('https://sharetext.me/raw/gf8pcwkix5') using the requests library and immediately executes it with exec(). This pattern is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior because it enables arbitrary code execution from an untrusted remote source without any user interaction, validation, or consent. The code also attempts to install the requests module if it is not present, which facilitates this remote code execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding this network fetch and execution. This behavior is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution, enabling attackers to run arbitrary payloads on the victim system, potentially leading to system compromise, data exfiltration, or further malware deployment."
