      "malicious_behavior": "The code silently collects Telegram Desktop user data from the APPDATA directory, specifically the 'Telegram Desktop\\tdata' folder, which contains sensitive Telegram session and user data. It compresses this data into an in-memory ZIP archive without any user consent or interaction. Then, it immediately exfiltrates this archive via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Telegram Bot API endpoint, sending the data to a specific chat ID controlled by the attacker. This behavior is a classic example of data theft and exfiltration. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setuptools.setup call, which suggests it may be executed during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of environment variables to locate sensitive user data, combined with network exfiltration to a hardcoded external endpoint without user knowledge, strongly indicates malicious intent."
