      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens immediately during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of distutils.core.setup with a suspicious package name and version, combined with the hidden execution of an encoded PowerShell command, strongly indicates malicious intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, further suggesting an attempt to evade detection. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealthy execution, obfuscation, and execution during package installation."
