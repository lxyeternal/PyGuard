      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using hexadecimal and escaped character sequences, dynamic eval calls, and base64 decoding. It dynamically imports standard modules like 'compile', 'exec', 'str.encode', and 'bytes', then defines functions that decode and transform data. The code includes a very large base64-encoded and likely compressed payload that is decoded and then executed dynamically via eval or exec. This pattern of obfuscation, dynamic decoding, and execution of hidden payloads is a hallmark of malicious code. The code does not show any legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the use of eval on decoded data strongly indicates arbitrary code execution. Such behavior is consistent with malware techniques to evade static analysis and deliver payloads at runtime. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
