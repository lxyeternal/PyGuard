      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This execution happens silently within a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, further indicating an attempt to evade detection or error reporting. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used to download or execute further payloads without user consent. Additionally, embedding such execution in a setup script (which runs during package installation) is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls setup() with typical metadata, but this is likely a decoy or cover for the malicious payload. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior consistent with stealthy, obfuscated payload execution during package installation."
