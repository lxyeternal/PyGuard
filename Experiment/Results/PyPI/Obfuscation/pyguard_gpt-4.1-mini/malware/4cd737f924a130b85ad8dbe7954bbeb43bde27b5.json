      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides a method to execute encrypted and obfuscated code during package installation, specifically on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). It imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules dynamically and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during the setuptools install process aligns with known malware behaviors such as remote code execution, payload delivery, and evasion of static analysis. The setup script also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, indicating these are needed for the malicious payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code is designed to run stealthily during installation, which is a critical risk pattern for malware."
