      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during install time strongly indicates malicious intent. Additionally, the setup script requires 'fernet' and 'requests' packages, which are used only in the malicious install hook, further supporting the conclusion that the code is designed to execute hidden malicious payloads on Windows systems during installation."
