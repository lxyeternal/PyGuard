      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary executable from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node') and writes it directly to '/tmp/node' without any validation or user consent. It then sets executable permissions and immediately executes this binary via a shell command. This download-and-execute pattern from an untrusted external source is a classic hallmark of malware, enabling remote code execution and potential system compromise. Additionally, this behavior is triggered automatically during the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The function and variable names are obfuscated, and there is no legitimate application logic or user interaction surrounding the network activity and execution. The presence of exception suppression (catching all exceptions and only printing stack traces) further suggests an attempt to avoid detection or failure notification. All these factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
