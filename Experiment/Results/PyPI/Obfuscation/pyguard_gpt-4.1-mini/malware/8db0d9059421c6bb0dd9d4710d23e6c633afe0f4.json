      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden process, which suggests conditional execution likely to avoid repeated or sandboxed runs. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, without user interaction or consent, is a hallmark of malicious activity. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of the hidden PowerShell execution in the installation context strongly indicates malicious intent."
