      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malware behavior, often used to download or execute further malicious payloads without user consent or visibility. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling execution of malicious code during package installation. The rest of the code (the setup call) appears benign but is overshadowed by the hidden execution of the encoded PowerShell command. The presence of obfuscation, hidden execution, and lack of user interaction or notification strongly indicates malicious intent."
