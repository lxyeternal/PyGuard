      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install process, embedding obfuscated base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed during package installation without user consent. The decoded payload performs environment checks for a Windows system and user directory, then downloads an executable from a suspicious hardcoded URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1152716280571375626/1249682250782478396/build_1.exe?ex=666830ca&is=6666df4a&hm=8b5329d678ac043154f656dc917956a923ec59125b0ce4d00a2436665a842db3) into the user's Windows startup programs folder and executes it. This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution and persistence by installing and running a potentially malicious executable silently during package installation. The use of obfuscation, silent exception handling, hardcoded suspicious URLs, writing to startup folders, and executing shell commands in the install hook are all critical risk indicators of malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
