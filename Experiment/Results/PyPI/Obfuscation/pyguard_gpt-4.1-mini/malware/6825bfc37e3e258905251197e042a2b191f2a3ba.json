      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function rn() that immediately executes a system shutdown command without any user interaction or consent. It checks the operating system platform and issues 'poweroff' on Linux or Darwin (macOS), and 'shutdown /s -f -t 0' on other systems (likely Windows). This causes an immediate shutdown of the user's machine upon running the script or installing the package. The function rn() is called at the top level, so this shutdown command executes immediately when the script is run or the package is installed. This behavior is highly suspicious and malicious because it forcibly powers off the user's system without warning or consent, which can cause data loss or disruption. Additionally, the malicious shutdown command is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The package name 'n0kw6ymes2hjnfi5' is random and suspicious, further indicating malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction to justify this behavior. Therefore, this code is malicious."
