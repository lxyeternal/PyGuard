      "malicious_behavior": "The code uses an extremely obfuscated and complex expression to reconstruct a string that is then executed via exec(). This pattern of converting many floating-point numbers to integers, then to characters, and joining them to form code that is executed dynamically is a classic obfuscation technique used to hide malicious payloads. The use of exec on dynamically reconstructed code is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows arbitrary code execution that is hidden from static analysis. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and automatic execution during package installation. The obfuscation and dynamic execution without any user interaction or transparency strongly suggest that the code is malicious."
