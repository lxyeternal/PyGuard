      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules to create a named temporary file, writes to it a Python script that imports urllib.request and executes a URL fetch from a suspicious external domain ('https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/7bupb/raw'), then closes the file and attempts to execute it as a Python script with a replaced extension from '.exe' to '.exe' (likely a no-op or obfuscation). This behavior is consistent with downloading and executing remote code without user consent, a classic malware pattern. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic execution, and fetching code from a suspicious external URL without validation or user interaction confirms the malicious nature of this code."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed immediately at the start. This payload imports modules to perform a network request to a suspicious URL ('https://pst.klgrtg.io/paste/7bupb/raw'), reads the response, writes it to a temporary file, and then executes it with a system shell command. This pattern of fetching remote code, writing it to disk, and executing it without user consent or validation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of obfuscation via base64 encoding and indirect imports further indicates an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the code uses system commands to clear the screen and set the console title, which are typical in malware to control the user interface stealthily. The initial execution of remote code fetched from an external, non-standard domain without user interaction or notification confirms that this code is malicious."
