      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. It checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to avoid repeated infection or detection. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used to download or execute further payloads without user consent or visibility. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks, enabling execution of malicious code during package installation. The presence of try-except blocks suppressing all exceptions further indicates an attempt to avoid detection or error reporting. Overall, these factors strongly indicate that the code is malicious."
