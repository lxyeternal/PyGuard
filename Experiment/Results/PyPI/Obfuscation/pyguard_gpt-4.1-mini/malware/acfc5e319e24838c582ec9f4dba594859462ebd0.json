      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses the setuptools install command to register a function that executes at exit during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The registered function collects sensitive system information including the public IP address (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current file's directory. It then encodes this information in base64 and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with a constructed query parameter. This behavior constitutes unauthorized system fingerprinting and data exfiltration without user consent. Additionally, the code writes a file named 'bykotko.txt' with the content 'kotko' in the current directory, which may be used as a marker or for persistence. The obfuscated variable names and the embedding of this network exfiltration logic inside the install command class further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent and execute code during package installation, a common supply chain attack technique. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network communication or file writing, and no user interaction or notification is present. Therefore, this code is malicious."
