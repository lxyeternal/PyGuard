      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a keylogger that captures keystrokes silently without user consent or interaction. It uses the 'pynput' library to listen to keyboard events, records all keys pressed (including special keys like enter, backspace, space), and stores them in obfuscated global variables. After the keylogging session ends (triggered by pressing the Escape key), it compiles the captured keystrokes into a string and writes them to a file in a relative '../data/data_file' path. Then, it attempts to send the logged keystrokes via email using hardcoded SMTP credentials (including sender email and password) to a recipient email address. This behavior constitutes unauthorized data collection and exfiltration of potentially sensitive user input, which is a classic malicious activity. The code lacks any user notification, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this behavior. The use of obfuscated variable and function names further indicates an attempt to hide its true intent. Therefore, this code is malicious as it performs covert keylogging and data exfiltration."
