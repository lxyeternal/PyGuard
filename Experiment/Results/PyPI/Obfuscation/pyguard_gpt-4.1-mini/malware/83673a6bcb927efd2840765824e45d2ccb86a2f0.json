      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. Key malicious characteristics include: \n\n1. Hardcoded Discord webhook URL used for exfiltration of stolen data.\n2. Obfuscated and nonsensical variable and function names to hinder analysis.\n3. Use of Windows DPAPI decryption (via crypt32) to decrypt encrypted browser data such as cookies and passwords.\n4. Extraction and decryption of browser login data and cookies from multiple browsers (Chrome, Opera, Brave, Edge, Yandex, etc.) and wallet applications.\n5. Searching user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files with keywords related to passwords, secrets, wallets, tokens, and exfiltrating them.\n6. Uploading stolen files to external services (e.g., transfer.sh) and sending links to the attacker via the Discord webhook.\n7. Use of threading to perform concurrent data collection and exfiltration.\n8. Silent exception handling to avoid detection.\n9. Installation-time execution pattern embedded in a setuptools setup script, indicating possible supply chain attack or malicious package installation.\n10. Use of base64 decoding and AES decryption to handle encrypted data stealthily.\n11. Collection of IP address and environment variables without user consent.\n12. Killing processes related to browsers or wallets to access locked files.\n13. No legitimate application logic or user interaction; all actions are automated and covert.\n\nThese behaviors align with known malware patterns for credential theft, token stealing, and data exfiltration. The presence of a hardcoded webhook URL for data exfiltration and the extensive credential harvesting from browsers and wallets confirm the code is malicious."
