      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It embeds a reverse shell payload inside a string variable that is written to a Python script file named 'remote-access.py' during the package installation process (via a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install). This payload attempts to connect back to a hardcoded external IP address (120.76.194.25) on port 1234 without any user interaction or consent. Upon successful connection, it spawns an interactive shell (cmd.exe on Windows or /bin/bash on Linux) with stdin, stdout, and stderr redirected to the socket, effectively providing remote command execution capabilities to the attacker. The installation class writes this script into the user's home directory (or Documents folder on Windows) and then launches it silently in the background using subprocess.Popen, again without user notification or consent. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. This pattern is a classic remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell implant, which is a critical security risk. The use of hardcoded IP, automatic execution on install, network socket creation, shell spawning, and background execution all confirm malicious intent."
