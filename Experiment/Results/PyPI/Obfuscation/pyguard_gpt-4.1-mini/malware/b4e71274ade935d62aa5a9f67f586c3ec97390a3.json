      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses heavy obfuscation techniques such as hex-encoded strings, dynamic evaluation via eval, and dynamic imports to hide its true intent. The code decodes and decompresses a large base64-encoded payload, then executes it dynamically, which is a classic hallmark of malware attempting to evade static analysis. The presence of functions that decode and transform data, combined with the use of eval on decoded content, strongly suggests arbitrary code execution. The obfuscated variable and function names, absence of legitimate application logic, and the use of base64 and zlib decompression followed by eval are consistent with known malware patterns. Additionally, the code appears to prepare and execute shell commands or payloads without user consent or interaction, which is typical in supply chain attacks or remote code execution malware. Given these factors and the extensive knowledge points on malicious Python code, this script is highly likely to be malicious."
