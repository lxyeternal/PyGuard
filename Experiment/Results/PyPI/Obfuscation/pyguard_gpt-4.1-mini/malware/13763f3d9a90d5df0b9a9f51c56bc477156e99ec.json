      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious IP address (http://194.163.191.205:6963/builds/Netflix_Checker.exe) directly into the user's Documents directory without any user interaction, validation, or notification. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using os.startfile. This pattern of downloading and executing a binary from an untrusted, hardcoded external source without user consent is a classic hallmark of malware. The use of a direct IP address rather than a legitimate domain, the naming of the executable to mimic a popular service (Netflix_Checker.exe), and the lack of any legitimate application logic or error handling further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."
