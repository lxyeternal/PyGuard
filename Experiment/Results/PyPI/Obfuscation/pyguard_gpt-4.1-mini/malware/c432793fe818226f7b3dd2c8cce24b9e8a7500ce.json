      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This means arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent or interaction. The use of encrypted payload and dynamic execution during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscated variable names and the absence of any legitimate application logic further support this conclusion. The code also specifies setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious install hook, indicating these dependencies are pulled in to facilitate the attack. Overall, this is a clear case of malicious behavior embedded in the package installation process, enabling arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine."
