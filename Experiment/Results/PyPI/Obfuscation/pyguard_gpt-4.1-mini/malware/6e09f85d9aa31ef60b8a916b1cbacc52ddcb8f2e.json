      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the install process of a Python package. During installation, it initiates a TCP connection to a hardcoded IP address (49.233.121.53) on port 54. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), and spawns an interactive shell (/bin/sh -i) connected to this socket. This effectively creates a reverse shell, allowing remote command execution on the victim machine without user consent or interaction. The use of base64 encoding to obscure the IP and port, obfuscated class and function names, and embedding this behavior in the package installation process are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware, specifically a remote access trojan (RAT) or backdoor, enabling unauthorized remote control of the host system."
