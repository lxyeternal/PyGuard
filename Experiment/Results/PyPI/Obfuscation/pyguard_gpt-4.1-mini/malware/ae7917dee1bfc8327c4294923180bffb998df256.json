      "malicious_behavior": "The code is embedded in a setuptools install subclass, which triggers execution during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. It uses obfuscated function and variable names to hide intent. The function kfwDctyxXgshseWPOwGlcitlUEcsDYqU collects system information such as platform details, current username (via 'whoami'), and home directory (via 'echo $HOME'). It then performs two silent HTTP GET requests using curl to a hardcoded suspicious IP address (http://3.221.152.203:8000) with URL paths constructed from system and user information. These requests are executed without user consent or notification, and their output is discarded, indicating covert data exfiltration or beaconing. The code lacks error handling, logging, or any legitimate application logic around these network calls. The use of os.popen with shell commands to gather sensitive environment data and send it to an external IP during installation is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The obfuscation, hardcoded external IP, execution during install, and silent exfiltration of system/user data collectively classify this code as malicious."
