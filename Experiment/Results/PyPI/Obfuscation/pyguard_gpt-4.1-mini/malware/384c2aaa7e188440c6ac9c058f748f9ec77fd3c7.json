      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects detailed system information including the stack trace, environment variables, system uname data, and the public IP address of the host by querying 'https://ipinfo.io/ip'. This information is then encoded as JSON and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded, obfuscated URL ('https://hooks.slack.com/services/...'), which is a suspicious external endpoint unrelated to any legitimate application context. The URL is base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, a common obfuscation technique to evade detection. The code also performs environment checks to avoid running on specific hostnames or filenames, likely to evade analysis or sandbox environments. There is no user interaction or consent, and the program forcibly exits after sending the data, which is typical of data exfiltration malware. The use of obfuscated function and variable names further suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Taken together, these behaviors align with known patterns of information-stealing malware that fingerprint the host and exfiltrate sensitive system data to an attacker-controlled server."
