      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The command is executed only if a directory named 'tahg' does not exist, suggesting conditional execution to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens during the import/setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the process window, increasing stealth. The rest of the code is a standard setup call, but the presence of this hidden, encoded PowerShell execution in a setup-related script strongly indicates malicious intent, likely to download or execute further payloads or perform unauthorized actions on the host system."
