      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens immediately upon import or execution of the script, without user interaction or consent, and is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
