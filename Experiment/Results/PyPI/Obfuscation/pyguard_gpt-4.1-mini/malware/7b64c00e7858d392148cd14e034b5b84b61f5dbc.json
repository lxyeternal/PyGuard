      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools' install command that overrides the install process to perform unauthorized data exfiltration. Specifically, during installation, it collects sensitive environment information including the hostname (via socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the current username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information as a dictionary in an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://1y05ug5pi97xa0bk2bjhdwp5yw4nsdg2.oastify.com), which is not associated with any legitimate service and appears to be a domain used for out-of-band interaction testing or potentially malicious data collection. The class and method names are obfuscated, indicating an attempt to hide the true intent. The network communication occurs silently during package installation without user consent or notification, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as: execution of code during package installation, exfiltration of sensitive system information to a suspicious external endpoint, use of obfuscated names, and absence of legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity. Therefore, this code is malicious."
