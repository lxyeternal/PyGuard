      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using character code escapes, dynamic eval calls, and base64 decoding. It dynamically imports standard modules like 'compile', 'exec', 'str.encode', and 'bytes', then defines functions that decode and transform data. The code includes a very large base64-encoded and obfuscated byte string that is decoded and then executed dynamically via eval. This pattern of zlib or base64 decompression followed by eval is a strong indicator of malicious intent, as it allows execution of hidden arbitrary code. The obfuscation and dynamic execution without any user interaction or legitimate application logic strongly suggest this code is designed to conceal and execute a malicious payload. Such behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payloads, dynamic code execution, and absence of benign context. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
