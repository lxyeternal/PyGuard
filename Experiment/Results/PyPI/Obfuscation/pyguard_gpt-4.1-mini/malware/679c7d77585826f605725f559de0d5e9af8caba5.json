      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is a common obfuscation method to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload delivery, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent or notification. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
