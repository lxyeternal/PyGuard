      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that performs an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard, hardcoded URL ('https://minagolosinastorpedolocutormarcar.com/golosinapastortorpedopularie.html') which is unrelated to any legitimate package source. It then creates a raw socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 8080 and duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls). Immediately after, it spawns a shell (/bin/sh) connected to this socket, effectively creating a reverse shell. This allows remote command execution on the victim machine without user consent or interaction. Furthermore, this malicious payload is embedded within a subclass of setuptools' install command, overriding an install method to execute the reverse shell function during package installation. This is a classic supply chain attack vector, where malicious code executes automatically upon package installation, without user awareness. The obfuscated function and class names, lack of error handling, and absence of legitimate application logic further confirm the intent to conceal malicious activity. All these factors combined make this code a high-risk, critical malicious threat."
