      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the installation process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The code abuses the package installation process (setup.py install hook) to run hidden, potentially harmful code on the victim's machine. This pattern is a known supply chain attack vector and is highly suspicious and dangerous."
