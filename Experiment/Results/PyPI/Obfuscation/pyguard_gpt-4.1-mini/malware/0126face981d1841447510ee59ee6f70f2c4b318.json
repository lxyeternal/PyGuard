      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides a method to execute encrypted and obfuscated code during package installation on Windows systems. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This behavior is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is executed at install time without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also requires 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup dependencies, which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the payload is executed silently during installation, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
