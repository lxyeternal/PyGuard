      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed environment information including the system's nodename, current user, current working directory, and a hardcoded string that resembles a package name. It encodes this information in base64 and then further encodes it into hex strings with randomization. It then constructs domain names using suspicious, non-standard domains (e.g., 'deliverycontent.online' and its subdomain). The code performs multiple 'ping' commands to these constructed domain names, which is unusual and likely a covert channel or beaconing technique. Subsequently, it attempts multiple HTTP requests (GET and POST) to these suspicious domains, sending the encoded environment data as parameters or payloads. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, indicating an attempt to evade detection. The obfuscation of variable names, the encoding and splitting of data, the use of non-standard domains, and the exfiltration of system information without user consent are all strong indicators of malicious behavior. This pattern matches known malware techniques for system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers. Therefore, this code is malicious."
