      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which suggests conditional execution likely to avoid repeated runs or detection. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command is a hallmark of malicious behavior, often used to download or execute further payloads, establish persistence, or perform unauthorized actions. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, which may be a decoy or to disguise the malicious intent within a seemingly benign package installation script. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup, all without user consent or transparency."
