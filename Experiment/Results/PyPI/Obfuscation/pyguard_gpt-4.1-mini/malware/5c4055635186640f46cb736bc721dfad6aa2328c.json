      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also requires 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup dependencies, which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction surrounding this network or execution activity. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code execution during install, obfuscation, encrypted payload execution, and use of network libraries for potential further malicious actions."
