      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and automatic execution during package installation without user consent. The script executes numerous shell commands to collect sensitive information such as AWS IAM security credentials from the instance metadata service, AWS credentials files, SSH keys, environment files, and system details (hostname, current working directory, username, IP address). It then aggregates this sensitive data and exfiltrates it to suspicious external endpoints (http://graph.pygrata.com:8000/upload and http://graphs.pygrata.com/api.php) via HTTP POST requests without any user interaction or notification. The code also writes this data to randomly named temporary files, uploads them, and deletes them afterward, which is a typical anti-forensics technique. Additionally, it performs DNS queries to attacker-controlled domains constructed from encoded user information, likely for tracking or command-and-control purposes. The use of obfuscated variable names, suppression of exceptions, and hardcoded suspicious URLs further confirm malicious intent. Overall, this code is designed to stealthily harvest and exfiltrate sensitive credentials and system information from the victim environment, constituting clear malicious behavior."
