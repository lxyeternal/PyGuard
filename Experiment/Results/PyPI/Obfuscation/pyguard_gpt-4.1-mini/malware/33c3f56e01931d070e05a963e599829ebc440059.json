      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via exec(). The decoded payload is a large block of obfuscated code that is executed immediately. Such use of base64 decoding combined with exec() is a classic and strong indicator of malicious intent, as it hides the true behavior of the code and bypasses static analysis. The code lacks any user interaction or legitimate application logic and instead uses obfuscation to conceal its actions. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including dynamic code execution from obfuscated sources, absence of transparency, and evasion of detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
