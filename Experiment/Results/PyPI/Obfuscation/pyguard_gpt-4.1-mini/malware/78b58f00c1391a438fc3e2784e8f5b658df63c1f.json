      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed via exec(), which is a strong indicator of obfuscated malicious intent. The decoded payload performs several suspicious actions: it checks for the existence of a specific Windows Start Menu path, writes multiple files with PowerShell scripts (.vbs, .pyw) into user directories, and executes shell commands that download and run executables from hardcoded external URLs (e.g., https://api-hw.com/dl/runtime and https://api-hw.com/dl/w). These actions include running PowerShell in hidden mode, downloading files without validation or user consent, and executing them, which are classic behaviors of malware for persistence, remote code execution, and potential payload delivery. The obfuscation via base64 encoding, execution during package setup, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution of shell commands without user interaction collectively confirm malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The import statement 'from pyrequester.requester import send' references a non-standard and suspicious module name 'pyrequester', which is not a known or widely used legitimate Python package. The name suggests network request capabilities, potentially for sending data. Given the context of typical malicious code characteristics, such a module could be used for unauthorized data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The import alone, without further context, is suspicious because it may be part of a malicious payload or backdoor functionality. The module name does not correspond to standard libraries or well-known packages, raising the risk of malicious intent, especially if used in conjunction with network communication without user consent or legitimate application logic."
