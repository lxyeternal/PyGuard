      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It performs an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded external URL (https://www.baidu.com) without user interaction or consent, which is suspicious in itself. 2) The function MKWFpGGtegsmECPWmWXKAgMLrhUQvqHe constructs and executes a shell command via subprocess.run with shell=True, which uses curl to POST extensive system information (hostname, current user, working directory, directory listings, user home directory contents, /etc/passwd, installed npm modules, and bash history) to a hardcoded external IP address (http://43.139.166.32:8080). This is a clear data exfiltration attempt. 3) The data exfiltration includes sensitive system and user information, which is a hallmark of information-stealing malware. 4) The code is embedded in a setup script context (setuptools.setup call), which can be used as a supply chain attack vector to execute malicious code during package installation. 5) There is no user notification, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying these actions. 6) The use of obfuscated function and variable names further suggests an attempt to hide malicious intent. Taken together, these factors strongly indicate that the code is malicious and designed to exfiltrate sensitive system information to an attacker-controlled server."
