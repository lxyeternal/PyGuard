      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method to execute encrypted and obfuscated code during package installation. Specifically, it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules, then uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload, which is then executed via exec(). This occurs conditionally only on Windows systems (os.name == 'nt'). The payload is embedded in the setup.py install hook, which is a known supply chain attack vector allowing arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code during installation strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also declares setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests', likely to ensure dependencies for the malicious payload. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the payload is hidden behind encryption and dynamic execution, which is a classic malware behavior pattern. Therefore, this code is malicious and represents a supply chain attack vector that executes hidden code on installation."
