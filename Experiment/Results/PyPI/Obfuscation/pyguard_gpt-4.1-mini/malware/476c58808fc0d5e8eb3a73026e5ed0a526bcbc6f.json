      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides the install method to execute additional code during package installation. Inside this method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt a large encrypted payload. The decrypted payload is then executed via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation strongly suggests the code is designed to run hidden malicious code on the victim's machine upon package installation. The presence of 'requests' and 'fernet' in setup_requires further supports that the package intends to perform network and cryptographic operations. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code is triggered automatically during install, which is a high-risk behavior consistent with malware."
