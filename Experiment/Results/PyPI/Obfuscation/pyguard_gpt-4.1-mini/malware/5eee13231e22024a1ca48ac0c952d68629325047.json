      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it dynamically imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent or interaction, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also specifies setup_requires for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used solely for this hidden payload execution. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including code execution during install, obfuscation, use of cryptography to hide payload, and dynamic execution of decrypted code. Therefore, this code is malicious."
