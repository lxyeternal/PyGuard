      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script that contains a command to fetch and execute code from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/97vnn/raw) without any user interaction or validation. It then attempts to execute this temporary script using a system call that launches a new Python interpreter process. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code dynamically during package setup—is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temporary file, and executing it immediately without user consent or validation strongly suggests a supply chain attack or remote code execution payload delivery. The code is embedded in a setup script, which is a known vector for malware in Python packages. Therefore, this code is malicious."
