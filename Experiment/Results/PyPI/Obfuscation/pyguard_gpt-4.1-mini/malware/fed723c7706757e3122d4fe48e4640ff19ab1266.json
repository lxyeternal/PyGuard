      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which executes a shell command during the package installation process without user interaction or consent. Specifically, it runs a bash reverse shell command that attempts to open an interactive shell and redirect input/output over a TCP connection to a hardcoded external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7888. This behavior is a classic indicator of a reverse shell backdoor, enabling remote code execution and unauthorized remote control of the victim's system. The use of a hardcoded IP address, execution of shell commands during install, and lack of legitimate application logic or user notification strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks and remote access trojans (RATs)."
