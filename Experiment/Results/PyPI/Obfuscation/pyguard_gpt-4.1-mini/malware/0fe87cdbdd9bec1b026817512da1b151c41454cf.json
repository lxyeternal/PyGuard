      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes shell commands during the package setup process without user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Specifically, it runs 'dig @1.1.1.1 install14.api.pygrata.com' and then attempts to upgrade/install a package 'pygrata-utils' via pip. The use of subprocess.getoutput in setup.py to perform network queries and install packages dynamically is suspicious and can be abused to execute arbitrary code or download malicious payloads. The domain 'install14.api.pygrata.com' is hardcoded and non-standard, raising suspicion about the intent. The code suppresses all exceptions silently, which can hide failures or detection. This pattern aligns with critical risk indicators for malicious behavior, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, use of hardcoded suspicious domains, and execution of shell commands without validation or user notification."
