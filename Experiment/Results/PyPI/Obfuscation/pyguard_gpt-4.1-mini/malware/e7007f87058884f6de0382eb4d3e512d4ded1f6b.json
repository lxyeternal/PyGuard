      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports the 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of executing arbitrary, obfuscated code at install time without user consent or interaction, which is a hallmark of supply chain attacks and malicious packages. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during the setup install phase strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, likely to ensure the environment can decrypt and execute the payload. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution during package installation, obfuscated and encrypted payload execution, and use of network-related libraries in an install hook, all of which are consistent with malware behavior."
