      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that downloads an executable file named 'Cleaner.exe' from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://a4a08d21-3950-435e-8b39-12ab7788cd10.id.repl.co/Cleaner.exe') without any user consent or validation. It writes this executable directly to disk and then executes it using os.system with a command that attempts to run it with 'RunAsInvoker' privilege level, which is a known technique to bypass privilege escalation prompts. This download-and-execute pattern is embedded in custom install and develop commands of setuptools, meaning the malicious payload is triggered automatically during package installation or development setup, a classic supply chain attack vector. The code uses obfuscated variable names and imports the 'requests' module dynamically inside the function, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, no error handling, no user interaction, and no validation of the downloaded content. These factors combined—hardcoded suspicious URL, automatic download and execution of an external executable during package installation, obfuscation, and privilege bypass attempts—are definitive hallmarks of malware."
