      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, which is commonly used to evade static detection. The command is executed via subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing the command, which suggests conditional execution possibly to evade sandbox or analysis environments. This execution happens at import or setup time without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, but the key malicious action is the hidden PowerShell execution. Given the use of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell commands executed silently during package setup, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
