      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, a common obfuscation method to evade detection. The command is executed only if a suspicious directory named 'tahg' does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade analysis or ensure persistence. The use of subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution occurs outside of any user interaction or legitimate application logic, embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspiciously random package name and version, but this is likely a decoy or to disguise the malicious intent. Overall, the combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered during package setup, with no user consent or transparency, matches multiple critical risk patterns associated exclusively with malware."
