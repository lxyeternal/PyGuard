      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that registers an atexit handler function, which executes automatically after installation without user consent. This function writes a file named 'bykotko.txt' with the content 'kotko' to the local directory, which is suspicious and unnecessary for typical package installation. It then collects sensitive environment information: the public IP address of the host (via https://api.ipify.org), the hostname (via os.uname()[1]), and the absolute path of the current file's directory (percent-encoded). This data is concatenated, base64-encoded, and sent via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious external domain 'https://kotko.org' with a constructed query parameter. The use of obfuscated variable names, embedding this data exfiltration in the install process, and the lack of any legitimate application logic around this network activity strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector. The code performs environment fingerprinting and covert data exfiltration during package installation, which is a hallmark of malicious Python packages. There is no user interaction, no error handling, and no legitimate purpose for these actions, confirming the code is malicious."
