      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated using hexadecimal string encoding, dynamic eval and exec calls, and multiple layers of decoding. It imports standard modules like base64, zlib, and others dynamically and uses them to decode and decompress large blocks of encoded data. The code then executes this decoded data dynamically. This pattern is a classic hallmark of malicious code designed to evade static analysis and hide its true intent. The use of eval on dynamically reconstructed strings, combined with base64 decoding and zlib decompression, strongly indicates that the code is executing hidden payloads. Such behavior is typical of malware that downloads or contains encrypted payloads and executes them at runtime without user consent or interaction. The obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques are consistent with supply chain attacks, remote code execution, and payload delivery mechanisms. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
