      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a shell command via os.system that performs the following actions without user consent or validation: it renames the existing '/usr/local/bin/ls' binary to '/usr/local/bin/ls_101', then downloads a file from a hardcoded suspicious IP address (159.89.160.135) to '/usr/local/bin/ls', and finally sets executable permissions on the downloaded file. This sequence effectively replaces a standard system utility ('ls') with a potentially malicious executable fetched from an untrusted external source. Such behavior is a classic indicator of malware aiming to persist and execute arbitrary code on the victim system by hijacking a common command. The use of a hardcoded IP address, lack of error handling, absence of user interaction, and direct execution of shell commands for payload replacement are all strong indicators of malicious intent."
