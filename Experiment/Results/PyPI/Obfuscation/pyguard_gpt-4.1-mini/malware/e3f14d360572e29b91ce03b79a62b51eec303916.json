      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is a Base64-encoded PowerShell script that is executed without user consent or interaction, indicating covert activity. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before launching this hidden process, which is a common evasion or staging tactic. The use of subprocess.Popen with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further suppresses any visible window, enhancing stealth. Additionally, this execution occurs in the context of a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The combination of obfuscated, encoded PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and execution triggered during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent."
