      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that fetches and executes code from a hardcoded, suspicious external IP address (http://54.237.36.60/inject/QrvxFGKvsSJ5E5bx) without any user interaction or validation. It then attempts to execute this temporary file using a system shell command that runs the Python executable in windowed mode. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code dynamically, writing to temp files, using obfuscated variable names, and executing shell commands without user consent—is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior. The use of exec() on network-fetched code is a critical red flag indicating arbitrary code execution, which can lead to system compromise, persistence, or further payload delivery. The absence of error handling and silent exception suppression further supports malicious intent."
