      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the hostname, username, current working directory, and a hardcoded string disguised as a package name. It encodes this information in base64, then further obfuscates it by converting to hex and splitting into chunks. It constructs domain names with suspicious, non-standard domains (e.g., 'deliverycontent.online' and its subdomain) and sends the encoded system information to these domains via multiple HTTP requests using urllib and requests libraries. Additionally, it executes multiple 'ping' commands to these constructed domain names, which is a covert channel often used for data exfiltration or command-and-control signaling. The code suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection and uses obfuscation techniques such as meaningless variable names and encoding to hide its intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the network activity is directed to suspicious external domains. These behaviors are consistent with information-stealing malware that performs system fingerprinting and data exfiltration to attacker-controlled servers."
