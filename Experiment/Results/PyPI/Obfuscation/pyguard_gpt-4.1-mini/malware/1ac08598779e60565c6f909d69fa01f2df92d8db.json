      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://kekwltd.ru/kekwltd.exe) and saves it to a hidden system directory under the user's APPDATA path (Microsoft folder). It then immediately executes this downloaded file using subprocess.call with the 'start' command, without any user interaction, validation, or notification. This pattern of fetching an executable from an untrusted external source, writing it to a system directory, and executing it directly is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The use of obfuscated variable names and lack of error handling further supports malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent involved, and the domain is not associated with any known safe or standard software distribution. Therefore, this code is highly indicative of malicious behavior, likely aiming to deploy and run a malware payload on the victim's system."
