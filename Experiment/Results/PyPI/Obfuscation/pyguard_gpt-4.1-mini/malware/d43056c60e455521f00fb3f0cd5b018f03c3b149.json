      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a function that retrieves the current username and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard domain (lqprfk1g9i68xn4f.b.requestbin.net), which is commonly used for capturing and analyzing HTTP requests, indicating potential data exfiltration. It then creates a raw TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (194.233.164.169) on port 1337, duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, and spawns a shell ('sh') via pty.spawn. This sequence is a classic reverse shell pattern, allowing an attacker remote command execution on the victim's machine. Furthermore, this malicious function is invoked during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools' install command and overriding its method to call the reverse shell function, which means the malicious code executes automatically upon package installation without user consent. The code also uses obfuscated variable names and imports, further indicating an attempt to hide malicious intent. These behaviors align with known supply chain attack vectors and remote access trojan (RAT) techniques, making the code definitively malicious."
