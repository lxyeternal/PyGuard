      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setup script, which triggers execution during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The code conditionally executes different payloads depending on the operating system, both of which are base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The Windows branch decodes and executes a large base64 string that, upon analysis, performs environment discovery, collects system and user information, and likely downloads and executes further payloads. The non-Windows branch similarly decodes and executes obfuscated code that performs network communication, environment fingerprinting, and remote command execution. The code uses dynamic execution functions (exec) on decoded data, writes files, and runs shell commands without user consent or validation. It also attempts to hide its activity by running processes in hidden windows and suppressing exceptions. The presence of hardcoded suspicious URLs, encoded payloads, environment enumeration, and network communication to external endpoints strongly indicate that this code is designed for unauthorized remote code execution, data exfiltration, and persistence. Therefore, this code is malicious."
