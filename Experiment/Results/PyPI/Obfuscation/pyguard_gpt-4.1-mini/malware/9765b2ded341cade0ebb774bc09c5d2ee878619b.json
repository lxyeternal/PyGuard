      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a network socket and connects to a hardcoded external IP address (3.228.3.164) on port 80 without any user interaction or consent. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls), effectively redirecting the shell's input/output to the network socket. Subsequently, it spawns an interactive shell (/bin/bash) using pty.spawn, which allows the remote host to execute arbitrary shell commands on the victim machine. The environment variable HISTFILE is set to /dev/null to prevent command history logging, indicating an attempt to evade detection. This pattern is a classic reverse shell implementation, a well-known malicious behavior that enables unauthorized remote control of the host system. There is no legitimate application logic, user consent, or error handling, and the use of a hardcoded external IP address further confirms the malicious intent."
