      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install with an obfuscated class name and overrides a method (likely the install method, but with an obfuscated name). Inside this method, it collects system information including the hostname (socket.gethostname()), current working directory (os.getcwd()), and the current username (getpass.getuser()). It then sends this information as a dictionary in an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL 'https://cdf5rwk2vtc0000c78d0ggz1hqeyyyyyb.oast.fun'. This behavior is embedded in the package installation process (setup call with a custom install command), which means it executes automatically during package installation without user consent or interaction. The use of obfuscated names, hardcoded suspicious external domain, collection and exfiltration of system information during install, and embedding this in the install command are all strong indicators of malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including data exfiltration, supply chain attack vector, and unauthorized network communication during installation."
