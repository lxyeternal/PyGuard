      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code contains strong indicators of malicious behavior. It includes a large block of obfuscated data that is base64 encoded, reversed, compressed with zlib, and then decrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption scheme with a hardcoded key. The decrypted data is then dynamically deserialized and executed via eval/exec, which is a classic technique for hiding and executing malicious payloads. The code uses multiple layers of encoding and encryption to evade static analysis and detection. Additionally, the code imports cryptography libraries and performs complex decoding and decryption steps before executing the payload, which is typical of malware attempting to conceal its true intent. The presence of such obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and cryptographic operations without any legitimate application logic or user interaction strongly suggests that this code is designed to execute hidden, potentially harmful actions on the host system."
