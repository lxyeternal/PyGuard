      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, Edge, Opera, Chrome) using the browser_cookie3 module without user consent. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects sensitive user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, creation date, and IP address. This sensitive data, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. There is no user interaction or consent, and the data exfiltration is done silently. These behaviors—unauthorized credential harvesting, sensitive data collection, and exfiltration to an attacker-controlled endpoint—are classic hallmarks of malicious credential-stealing malware."
