      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior embedded within what appears to be a legitimate setup script. After the setup() call, there are two nearly identical try-except blocks that perform the following suspicious actions: they collect environment information including the current working directory's last segment, the current user's username, and the hostname. This information is concatenated into a string, then obfuscated by XORing each character with a repeating key. The obfuscated string is base64-encoded and sent as part of a crafted HTTP GET request to a hardcoded remote server IP address (decoded from base64 as 'MTIxLjQyLjIxNy40NA==', which corresponds to '121.42.217.44') on port 0o17620 (octal for 6304 decimal). The network communication is done silently with exceptions suppressed, indicating an attempt to avoid detection. This pattern of environment fingerprinting combined with covert exfiltration of data to a hardcoded external IP during package installation is a classic hallmark of malicious code, often used for reconnaissance or as a staging step for further attacks. The obfuscation, lack of user consent or interaction, and embedding in the setup script strongly indicate a supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code is malicious."
