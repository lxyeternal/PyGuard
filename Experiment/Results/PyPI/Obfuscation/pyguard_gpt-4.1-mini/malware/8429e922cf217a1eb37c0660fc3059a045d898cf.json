      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (a GitHub raw URL hosting 'test.exe') without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable to disk with a temporary, suspicious filename and immediately executes it using os.system with the 'start' command on Windows. This behavior is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and execution, commonly used in malware delivery and execution. The function and variable names are obfuscated, and the malicious payload is triggered immediately during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. There is no validation, user notification, or integrity check on the downloaded file, and the code quits silently on non-Windows platforms, indicating targeted malicious intent. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code contains malicious behavior."
