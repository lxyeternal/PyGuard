      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, it collects sensitive system information such as the hostname, current working directory, and username, then sends this data via multiple HTTP GET requests to suspicious, hardcoded external domains (e.g., 'j0j0.xyz'). Furthermore, it attempts to read highly sensitive system files '/etc/passwd' and '/etc/shadow' (which contain user account and password hash information on Unix-like systems) and exfiltrates their contents via HTTP POST requests to the same external domain. This behavior occurs silently during package installation without user consent or interaction, indicating a supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded suspicious URLs, and exfiltration of sensitive files are strong indicators of malicious intent consistent with information-stealing malware. Therefore, this code is malicious."
