      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection and analysis. The subprocess.Popen call runs this command without user interaction or consent and suppresses exceptions silently, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. Additionally, this execution is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The combination of obfuscated, hidden execution of encoded PowerShell commands, silent exception handling, and embedding in a setup script strongly aligns with known malicious patterns and supply chain attack techniques."
