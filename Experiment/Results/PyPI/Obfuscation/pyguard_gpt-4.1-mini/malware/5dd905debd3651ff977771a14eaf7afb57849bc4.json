      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to stealthily extract Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers installed on the victim's machine using the browser_cookie3 library. It collects these sensitive cookies without user consent or interaction. Then, it validates the cookie and, if valid, gathers detailed user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, and creation date via Roblox APIs. It also fetches the victim's public IP address. Subsequently, it exfiltrates all this sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, the IP address, and account details, to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL (assigned to the variable VCMTzrTvLAHDEoNLbshluxgmzujYZlJL). The webhook URL is embedded in the code and used in multiple POST requests to send stolen credentials and user data. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions silently to avoid detection. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic justifying this behavior. The combination of stealing authentication cookies, collecting personal account data, and exfiltrating it to an external webhook without authorization is a classic pattern of credential theft and data exfiltration malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
