      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and dynamic execution via exec(). The decoded payload is executed immediately, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Such obfuscation is commonly used to hide the true behavior of the code and evade static analysis. The code does not contain any user interaction or legitimate application logic and instead relies on executing hidden, encoded payloads. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including dynamic code execution of obfuscated data, lack of transparency, and evasion techniques. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
