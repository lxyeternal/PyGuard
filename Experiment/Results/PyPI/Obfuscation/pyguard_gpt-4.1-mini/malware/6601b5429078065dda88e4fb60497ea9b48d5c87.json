      "malicious_behavior": "The code creates a TCP socket and connects to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain 'dzgi0h7on1jhzdg0vknw9pp9309rxjl8.oastify.com' on port 10010 without any user interaction or consent. It then duplicates the socket's file descriptor to stdin, stdout, and stderr using os.dup2, effectively redirecting the standard input/output/error streams to the network socket. This is a classic technique used in reverse shell implementations, allowing remote command execution. Furthermore, the code decodes a base32-encoded string (with a minor obfuscation by replacing '!' with 'G') to obtain a command string, which is then executed via subprocess.call with the '-i' argument, likely to spawn an interactive shell. The obfuscation, hardcoded suspicious domain, network connection, and spawning of an interactive shell over the network are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with a reverse shell or remote access trojan (RAT). There is no legitimate application logic, user consent, or error handling, further confirming the malicious intent."
