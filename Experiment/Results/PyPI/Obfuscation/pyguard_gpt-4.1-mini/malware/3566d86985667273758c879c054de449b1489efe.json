      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. It first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens outside of any user interaction or consent and is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, a common vector for supply chain attacks. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with suspiciously random package name and version, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload execution during installation, and stealthy command execution without user consent, all of which are hallmark signs of malicious activity."
