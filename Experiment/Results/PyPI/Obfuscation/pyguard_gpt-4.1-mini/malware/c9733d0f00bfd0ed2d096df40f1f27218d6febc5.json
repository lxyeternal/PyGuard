      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/jagermager999/8746465cdg78cdsxasy8a/raw/main/test.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It saves this executable with a suspicious temporary filename ('tmp_file_pypi_29x7d0kf8.exe') and immediately executes it using os.system with the 'start' command on Windows. This behavior is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and execution, which is a strong indicator of malware. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The obfuscated function and variable names further suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. There is no validation, user notification, or legitimate application logic surrounding the network activity and execution. The code also quits immediately if not on Windows, indicating targeted malicious behavior. All these factors combined confirm that the code contains malicious behavior."
