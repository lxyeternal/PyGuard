      "malicious_behavior": "The code silently extracts Roblox authentication cookies (.ROBLOSECURITY) from multiple browsers on the victim's machine using the browser_cookie3 library without user consent. It then validates the cookie and, if valid, collects detailed user information such as UserID, Robux balance, friends count, account age, RAP, creation date, and IP address. This sensitive information, including the .ROBLOSECURITY cookie itself, is exfiltrated to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL via HTTP POST requests. The code uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. There is no user interaction or consent, and the data exfiltration is covert. These behaviors align with typical malicious patterns of credential theft and data exfiltration, making this code malicious."
