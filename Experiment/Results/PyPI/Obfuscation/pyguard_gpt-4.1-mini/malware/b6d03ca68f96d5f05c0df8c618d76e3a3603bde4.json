      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens during the import or setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a typical supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of obfuscated, hidden PowerShell execution triggered conditionally, without error reporting, and embedded in a setup script is a strong indicator of malicious intent consistent with known malware patterns."
