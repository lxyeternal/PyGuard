      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only then runs the hidden PowerShell command, which is a common evasion or staging technique. This execution happens at import or setup time without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a package setup script. The use of subprocess with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW further hides the execution window. These patterns are strongly associated with malicious behavior, including stealthy payload execution, potential persistence, or further payload download/execution. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package installation script. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malware, including obfuscated command execution, hidden process spawning, and execution triggered during package setup, consistent with supply chain attack vectors."
