      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads a binary executable from a hardcoded, suspicious URL ('https://github-bebra.s3.filebase.com/node') and writes it to a temporary directory (/tmp/node) without any validation or user consent. It then sets executable permissions and immediately executes this downloaded file using a shell command. This behavior is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and execution, commonly used in malware for payload delivery and system compromise. The function name is obfuscated, and the code is executed immediately during package setup, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The absence of any legitimate application logic, user interaction, or error handling around this network and execution activity further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."
