      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens immediately upon import or run, without user interaction or consent, embedded in what appears to be a setup script (using distutils.core.setup), which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The use of subprocess with creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth. The rest of the code attempts to run a standard setup call but is overshadowed by the hidden PowerShell execution. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as hidden process execution, obfuscated payload delivery, execution during package installation, and lack of user consent or transparency, all of which strongly indicate malicious intent."
