      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a direct call to os.system with a hardcoded curl command that fetches a script from a suspicious external IP address (http://108.61.251.172:8080/revssh/108.61.251.172/2222) and pipes it directly to /bin/bash for execution. This pattern is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior, as it downloads and executes remote code without any user interaction, validation, or consent. The use of a raw IP address instead of a domain name, combined with immediate shell execution, strongly suggests a reverse shell or remote access trojan payload. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script context, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks, enabling arbitrary code execution during package installation. The rest of the code appears to be obfuscated with meaningless variable names, which is often used to hide malicious intent. Therefore, this code is highly likely to be malicious."
