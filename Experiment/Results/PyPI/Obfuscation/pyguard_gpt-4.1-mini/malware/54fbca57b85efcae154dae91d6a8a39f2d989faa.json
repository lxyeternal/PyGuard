      "malicious_behavior": "The code executes a subprocess command during package setup that runs a PowerShell command to download an executable file from a hardcoded Dropbox URL (https://dl.dropbox.com/s/mkd3enun97s8zag/Oxzy.exe?dl=0) and saves it as '~/WindowsCache.exe'. It then immediately executes this downloaded file using Invoke-Expression. This behavior is a classic example of remote payload retrieval and execution without user consent or validation, which is a hallmark of malware. The code suppresses exceptions silently, attempts to install subprocess if missing, and runs the payload in a hidden window context (subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW). The use of a setup script to trigger this download-and-execute sequence indicates a supply chain attack vector or malicious package installation. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, no validation of the downloaded file, and the URL is hardcoded and suspicious. All these factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent."
