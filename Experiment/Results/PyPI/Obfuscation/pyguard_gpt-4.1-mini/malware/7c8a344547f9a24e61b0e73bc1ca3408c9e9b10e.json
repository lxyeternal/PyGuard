      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens silently without user interaction or consent, and the subprocess is created with the CREATE_NO_WINDOW flag to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The presence of this obfuscated, hidden, encoded PowerShell execution in a setup script context strongly indicates malicious intent, as it is a common vector for malware delivery, persistence, or payload execution during package installation. The rest of the code is a standard setup call but is overshadowed by the suspicious subprocess invocation. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
