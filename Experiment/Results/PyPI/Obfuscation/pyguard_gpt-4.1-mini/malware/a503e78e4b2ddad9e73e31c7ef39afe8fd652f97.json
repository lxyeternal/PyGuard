      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the standard setuptools install command. Inside the run() method, it contains a large obfuscated string and a long numeric string. The code then performs a character-wise XOR operation between these two strings to reconstruct a hidden payload. This payload is then dynamically compiled and executed using eval(compile(...)). This pattern of obfuscated payload reconstruction and dynamic execution during package installation is a classic hallmark of malicious behavior, enabling arbitrary code execution without user consent. The obfuscation and execution occur silently inside the install hook, suppressing all exceptions, which further indicates an attempt to evade detection. The package name 'sq1ryotmjrogb0k6' is suspicious and does not correspond to any known legitimate package. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this behavior. According to the provided knowledge points, such obfuscated dynamic code execution in setup/install scripts is a critical risk and a strong indicator of malware or supply chain attack. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
