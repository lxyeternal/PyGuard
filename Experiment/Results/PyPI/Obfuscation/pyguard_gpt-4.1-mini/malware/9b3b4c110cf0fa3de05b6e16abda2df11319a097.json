      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware. It collects sensitive user data such as Discord tokens, emails, phone numbers, billing information, and user badges by querying Discord APIs with stolen tokens. It also searches local directories for browser data including cookies, passwords, and local storage files, decrypts them using Windows DPAPI, and extracts credentials and tokens. The code then uploads stolen data to external servers via HTTP POST requests to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, effectively exfiltrating sensitive information without user consent. It uses obfuscated variable and function names, suppresses exceptions, and employs threading to perform background data collection and exfiltration stealthily. The presence of cryptographic decryption functions, base64 decoding, and Windows API calls for DPAPI decryption further confirm its intent to steal protected credentials. Additionally, it kills browser processes to access locked files, compresses data into zip archives, uploads them to file hosting services, and sends detailed reports to the attacker-controlled webhook. The code does not require user interaction and operates autonomously, fulfilling many typical characteristics of malware such as credential theft, data exfiltration, and stealthy operation. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code imports a module named 'module.pytoolib' and calls a function with an obfuscated name 'IUOCZmJRhWyhkGhhqjbRabLbYKuKHuWK' passing the string 'boolean' as an argument. The use of a non-standard module name 'module.pytoolib' and an obfuscated function name is a strong indicator of obfuscation, which is a common tactic in malicious code to hide intent. The code snippet provides no context or legitimate application logic, and the obfuscation suggests it may be executing hidden or unauthorized actions. Given the extensive knowledge points, such obfuscation and indirect invocation without clear purpose or user interaction is suspicious and typical of malware attempting to evade detection. Without further code, the exact behavior cannot be fully determined, but the pattern strongly aligns with malicious intent."
