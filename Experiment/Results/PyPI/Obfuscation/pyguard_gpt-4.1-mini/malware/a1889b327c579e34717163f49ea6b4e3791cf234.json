      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (a Discord CDN link hosting 'Setup.exe') without any user interaction, validation, or notification. It writes the downloaded content directly to disk as 'download.exe' and then immediately executes it using os.startfile. This pattern of fetching an executable from an external source and running it without consent or integrity checks is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. The obfuscated function and variable names further suggest an attempt to hide intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user consent involved, and the code performs network activity followed by writing and executing a potentially untrusted binary, which is a critical risk indicator of malicious behavior."
