      "malicious_behavior": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated and contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It uses obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic code execution via exec and eval on decompressed and decoded data, and embeds large blocks of compressed binary data that are decompressed and executed at runtime. The code also includes patterns typical of malware such as dynamic imports, zlib decompression followed by eval, and execution of code during package installation (setup.py context). The presence of hardcoded URLs (e.g., Discord webhook, GitHub repo with suspicious naming), obfuscated payloads, and dynamic execution without user consent strongly indicate this is a supply chain attack or malware payload. The code attempts to hide its intent by using confusing variable names, indirect function calls, and encoded payloads. These behaviors match multiple critical risk indicators for malicious Python code, including arbitrary code execution from obfuscated sources, payload delivery during installation, and evasion techniques. Therefore, this code is malicious."
