      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded string that is decoded and executed dynamically via exec(). The decoded payload creates a socket connection to a hardcoded IP address (192.168.43.113) on port 8080, attempts to connect, and then enters a loop receiving data, decompressing it with zlib, decoding from base64, and executing it. This pattern is a classic reverse shell or remote code execution backdoor, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the victim machine. The use of obfuscation (base64 encoding), dynamic execution (exec), and network connection to a hardcoded IP without user consent or interaction are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, this code is embedded in a setup script, which means it executes during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. All these factors combined confirm that the code is malicious."
