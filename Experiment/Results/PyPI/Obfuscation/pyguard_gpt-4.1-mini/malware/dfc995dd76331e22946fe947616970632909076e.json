      "malicious_behavior": "The code collects detailed system information including the hostname, current user, current working directory, and a hardcoded string 'AadhaarCrypt_1.0'. It encodes this information in base64, then further obfuscates it by converting to hex and splitting it into chunks. It then constructs domain names using hardcoded suspicious domains ('deliverycontent.online' and its subdomain) and sends this encoded system information to these domains via multiple methods: ping commands to crafted subdomains, HTTP GET and POST requests using urllib and requests libraries. The code suppresses all exceptions to avoid detection and uses obfuscation techniques such as random chunking, hex encoding, and base64 encoding to hide the data being exfiltrated. There is no user interaction or consent, and the data sent includes potentially sensitive system identifiers. The use of hardcoded suspicious external domains, obfuscated data exfiltration, and execution of system commands (ping) to communicate covertly are strong indicators of malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware or a command-and-control beacon. Therefore, this code is malicious."
