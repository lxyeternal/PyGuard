      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded PowerShell command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence technique. This execution happens silently within a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, further indicating an attempt to avoid detection. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command during the setup script execution strongly suggests malicious intent, as it enables arbitrary code execution without user consent or interaction. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload within a seemingly benign package installation script. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including obfuscated payload execution, stealth process spawning, and abuse of the package installation process for unauthorized code execution."
