      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which is executed during package installation. In the overridden install method, it collects extensive system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, network configuration (ifconfig or ipconfig), public IP address (via curl ifconfig.me), current user (whoami), hostname, and running processes (tasklist on Windows). It then sends all this sensitive system and user information via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL (https://hooks.slack.com/services/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) without any user consent or notification. This behavior is a classic example of information stealing and data exfiltration embedded in a package installation script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, execution during install time, no legitimate application logic, and hardcoded external webhook URL for exfiltration are strong indicators of malicious intent. Therefore, this code is malicious."
