      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, external URL (a Discord CDN link) without any user interaction or validation, writes it to a suspicious path within the user's AppData Local directory as 'explorer.exe' (a name mimicking a legitimate Windows process), and then executes it via subprocess.run with shell=True. This sequence is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and execution, commonly used by malware for persistence or further compromise. The use of environment variables to construct the path, absence of error handling or user consent, obfuscated variable names, and direct execution of downloaded content without integrity checks strongly indicate malicious intent."
