      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits clear malicious behavior characterized by unauthorized data exfiltration and privacy violation. It uses hardcoded Telegram bot tokens and chat IDs to send files and images from the victim's device to an attacker-controlled Telegram chat. Specifically, it enumerates files in sensitive directories such as '/storage/emulated/0' and '/sdcard/DCIM', targeting file types like '.py', '.php', '.zip', and image files ('.png', '.jpg', '.jpeg'). It silently reads these files and sends their contents or the files themselves via Telegram API calls without any user interaction or consent. The obfuscated variable and function names, absence of error reporting, and the use of concurrent threads to perform these actions stealthily further indicate malicious intent. This behavior aligns with typical data exfiltration malware patterns, violating user privacy and security."
