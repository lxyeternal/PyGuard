      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior: 1) It contains a hardcoded Discord webhook URL to which it immediately sends a POST request notifying that the package 'reverse_shell' has been installed, indicating unsolicited data exfiltration without user consent. 2) The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. 3) It clones a GitHub repository from a suspicious source ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') into a hardcoded Windows user directory path ('C:\\Users\\repo'), which is unusual and potentially used for staging or persistence. 4) It changes the working directory to this cloned repo and executes a Python script ('bypass.py') via subprocess without any validation or user interaction, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. 5) The code is embedded in a setup script context, which means it can execute automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. 6) There is no error handling or user notification, and the network communication is unsolicited and to a non-standard endpoint. These factors combined strongly indicate that the code is designed to perform unauthorized remote code execution and data exfiltration, classifying it as malicious."

This is a form of data exfiltration or notification to an attacker-controlled endpoint without user consent. 2) It clones a Git repository from a hardcoded URL ('https://github.com/NotInfected/updater.git') into a fixed directory on the user's system ('C:\\Users\\repo'), which is suspicious as it downloads and stages code without user interaction or validation. 3) It changes the working directory to this cloned repo and executes a Python script ('bypass.py') via subprocess.run without any error handling or user notification, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. 4) The function and variable names are obfuscated, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. 5) The overall pattern—silent network communication to an external webhook, automatic cloning of remote code, and execution of that code—is a classic supply chain or post-installation malware behavior.

These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as unsolicited network communication to attacker-controlled endpoints, remote code retrieval and execution, and obfuscation, all of which are hallmarks of malware or supply chain attacks."
