      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that executes during package installation without user consent. It sets an environment variable to suppress gitpython warnings, then uses gitpython to clone a GitHub repository into the Windows Startup folder under a suspiciously named 'boot' directory. It then renames a Python script from the cloned repository into the Startup folder, effectively placing a script that will run automatically on user login. This behavior is a classic persistence mechanism used by malware to maintain execution on system startup. The use of obfuscated class and method names, hardcoded paths targeting the user's AppData Startup folder, and cloning from an external GitHub repository without validation or user interaction are strong indicators of malicious intent. The code executes this payload during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior aimed at stealthy persistence and unauthorized code execution on the victim's machine."
