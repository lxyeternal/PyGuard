      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install with an obfuscated class name and overrides an install-related method to perform unauthorized data exfiltration during package installation. It collects the local machine's hostname and IP address using the socket module and gathers detailed platform information via the platform module. It then sends this sensitive system information to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, non-standard endpoint unrelated to any legitimate package functionality. This exfiltration occurs silently during the installation process without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The use of an obfuscated class name, embedding malicious network communication in the install command, and sending system fingerprinting data to a hardcoded external webhook are strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this behavior, and the code abuses the package installation process to perform covert data exfiltration, making it malicious."
