      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding, zlib compression, and character code transformations to hide its true intent. The code dynamically reconstructs and executes code via eval and exec calls on decompressed and decoded payloads, a classic hallmark of malware designed to evade static analysis. The presence of compressed and encoded data that is decoded and executed at runtime strongly suggests arbitrary code execution capabilities. The obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns align with known malware techniques for payload delivery and execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the code uses suspicious constructs to hide its operations. Based on these factors and the known risk patterns, this code is malicious."
