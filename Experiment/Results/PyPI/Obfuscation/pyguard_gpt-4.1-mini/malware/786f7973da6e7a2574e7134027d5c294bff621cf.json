      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is a malicious credential stealer targeting Discord tokens, browser passwords, cookies, and other sensitive data. It collects Discord tokens from various local storage paths of browsers and Discord clients, decrypts stored passwords and cookies using Windows DPAPI (CryptUnprotectData), and exfiltrates this data to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL. The code also searches user directories (Desktop, Downloads, Documents) for files containing keywords related to accounts, passwords, and secrets, uploads them to an anonymous file hosting service, and sends links to the attacker. It uses threading to perform these actions stealthily and suppresses exceptions to avoid detection. The presence of a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, the use of Windows API calls to decrypt protected data, the collection of sensitive credentials without user consent, and the immediate exfiltration of this data over the network are strong indicators of malicious intent. Additionally, the code is embedded in a setup script context, which can be used for supply chain attacks or to execute upon package installation without user awareness. All these factors confirm that the code is designed for unauthorized data theft and exfiltration, classifying it as malicious."
