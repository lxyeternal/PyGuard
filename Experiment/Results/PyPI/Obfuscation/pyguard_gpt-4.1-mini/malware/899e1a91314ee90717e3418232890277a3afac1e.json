      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with an encoded payload using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of potentially malicious code. The encoded command is obfuscated and executed without user consent or interaction, indicating an attempt to evade detection. Additionally, the code checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' before executing this command, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. The use of subprocess with CREATE_NO_WINDOW suppresses any visible window, further indicating stealth behavior. This execution occurs outside of any legitimate build or setup logic, and the encoded PowerShell command likely downloads or executes further payloads. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except block, which appears benign but is overshadowed by the hidden PowerShell execution. These factors combined strongly indicate malicious intent consistent with supply chain attacks or malware delivery mechanisms."
