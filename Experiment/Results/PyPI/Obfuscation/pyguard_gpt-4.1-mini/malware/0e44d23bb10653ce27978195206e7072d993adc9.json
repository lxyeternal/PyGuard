      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It defines a custom install command class that overrides the setuptools install process to execute the function sfvECQfFOzINIUxceqhyIrGARaZukMEs() during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The function reads system uptime from /proc/uptime, collects detailed system information including OS version and IP address, and then creates a raw TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external IP address (134.209.85.64) on port 80. It sends the collected system information over this connection without any user consent or notification, indicating data exfiltration. The use of obfuscated variable and function names, absence of error handling, and embedding of this behavior in the install hook further confirm malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this network communication or data collection. This pattern matches critical risk indicators for malware, including unauthorized environment discovery and exfiltration triggered during package installation, a classic supply chain attack technique."
