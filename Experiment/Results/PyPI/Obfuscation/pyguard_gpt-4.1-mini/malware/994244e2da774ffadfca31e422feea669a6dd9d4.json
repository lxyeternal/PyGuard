      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a temporary Python script that imports urllib.request and executes code fetched from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/c24j2/raw) without any user interaction or validation. It then attempts to execute this temporary script using os.system with a Windows-specific command that runs the Python interpreter in windowed mode. This pattern—downloading and executing remote code dynamically during package setup—is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior, often used in supply chain attacks or malware delivery. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing and executing a temp file, and fetching code from an untrusted external source during installation without user consent confirms the code is malicious."
