      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It defines a base64 decoding function that decodes a hardcoded base64 string representing a shell command. This command uses 'curl' to fetch data from a suspicious external URL (https://ac9c-54-204-140-51.ngrok-free.app) and executes it via os.system without any user interaction or consent. The code hooks into setuptools installation commands (install and develop) by subclassing and overriding methods to execute this network fetch and command execution during package installation or development setup. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector, enabling remote code execution at install time, which is a critical risk. The obfuscation of function and class names, the use of base64 encoding to hide the payload, the hardcoded suspicious external URL, and the execution of shell commands during package installation without user consent all strongly indicate malicious intent."
