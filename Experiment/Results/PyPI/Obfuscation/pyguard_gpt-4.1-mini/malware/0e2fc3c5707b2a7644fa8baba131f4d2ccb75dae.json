      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class for setuptools that overrides the install process. During installation, if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts an encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This behavior is a classic example of arbitrary code execution triggered during package installation without user consent, which is a common supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution of decrypted code at install time strongly indicates malicious intent. The code also specifies 'fernet' and 'requests' as setup requirements, which are likely used to facilitate the malicious payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the payload is hidden inside the install hook, which is a known tactic to evade detection. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
