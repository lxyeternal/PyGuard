      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded within a setup script, which triggers execution during package installation, a common supply chain attack vector. The code conditionally executes different payloads based on the operating system, both of which are base64-encoded and decoded at runtime, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. The Windows branch executes a heavily obfuscated PowerShell command in hidden mode, a hallmark of stealthy malware execution. The non-Windows branch performs environment discovery, collects system and user information, and sends it to suspicious external endpoints. It also dynamically imports modules, writes files, and executes shell commands without user consent or validation. The code uses obfuscated directory and file names, temporary files, and network communication to download and execute further payloads. These behaviors align with known malicious patterns such as remote code execution, data exfiltration, persistence establishment, and evasion techniques. Therefore, this code is conclusively malicious."
