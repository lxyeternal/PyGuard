      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that executes during package installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. It performs the following suspicious and malicious actions without user consent or notification: 1) It creates directories inside the Windows user's Start Menu Programs folder, including a Startup\\boot directory and a Powerpoint directory, which are unusual and likely intended for persistence. 2) It clones two GitHub repositories from hardcoded URLs (https://github.com/dcsage/test2lmaos.git and https://github.com/dcsage/defonotagrabber.git) directly into these directories, which is a classic remote payload retrieval technique. 3) It renames a Python script from the cloned repository into the Startup folder, likely to ensure execution on user login, establishing persistence. 4) It immediately executes a binary named main.exe from the cloned defonotagrabber repository, which is highly suspicious and likely malicious payload execution. 5) The entire sequence is triggered automatically during the package installation process (via setuptools install subclass), without any user interaction or validation, which is a critical risk and hallmark of malicious supply chain attacks. 6) The use of obfuscated class and method names further indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. These behaviors align with multiple critical risk indicators such as unauthorized code execution during install, persistence via Startup folder manipulation, remote payload download and execution, and obfuscation. Therefore, this code is malicious."
