      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names and uses XOR-based string decoding to hide module names, function names, and string literals. It dynamically imports modules with obfuscated names, including network communication libraries (e.g., httpx_socks), threading, and others, which it uses to perform covert operations. The code constructs file paths and filenames in an obfuscated manner and writes data to disk without user consent or validation. It performs network requests to suspicious, obfuscated URLs and sends encoded or encrypted data, consistent with data exfiltration or command-and-control communication. The code uses threading to run background tasks, likely to evade detection. It also includes functions that decode and execute dynamically constructed code, a hallmark of malware enabling arbitrary code execution. The overall structure, obfuscation, dynamic imports, network communication to suspicious endpoints, file writing, and execution of decoded payloads strongly align with known malicious patterns such as remote payload retrieval, persistence mechanisms, and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names and encoded strings that are dynamically decoded and imported. It performs dynamic imports of standard and non-standard modules using obfuscated names, indicating an attempt to hide its true functionality. The code constructs and sends HTTP requests to suspicious, obfuscated URLs, downloads content from these URLs, writes the content to disk with suspicious filenames, and executes it without any user interaction or consent. It uses threading and event waiting to manage execution flow, likely to evade detection. The code also performs environment fingerprinting by collecting system information and sending it to remote servers. The presence of subprocess and importlib usage combined with obfuscated network communication, file writing, and execution strongly indicates malicious intent. These behaviors align with typical malware patterns such as remote payload retrieval, persistence setup, and covert execution. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."

      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, encoded strings, and dynamic imports, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent. It uses complex lambda functions and character-wise XOR operations to decode strings, including module names and data, indicating an attempt to evade static analysis. The code dynamically imports modules using obfuscated names, which is suspicious. It also creates and starts threads with obfuscated targets, suggesting background execution of hidden payloads. The presence of decoded data that appears to be encrypted or encoded payloads, combined with dynamic execution patterns, strongly indicates that the code is designed to execute hidden or remote code. The code matches multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscation, dynamic code execution, threading for stealth, and indirect imports, all of which are hallmark behaviors of malware. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
