      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to avoid repeated detection or analysis. This execution happens during the import/setup phase without user interaction or consent, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks or malware installation. The use of distutils.core.setup with a suspicious package name and version alongside this hidden execution further suggests an attempt to disguise malicious activity within a package installation script. The subprocess call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, increasing stealth. The overall pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators: obfuscated payload execution, hidden process spawning, execution during package setup, and lack of user consent or notification. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
