      "malicious_behavior": "The code implements a reverse shell backdoor. It performs a DNS TXT record lookup on the suspicious domain 'poiqwe.info' to retrieve a port number, then establishes a TCP connection to that domain and port. It duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error, and spawns a bash shell connected to this socket, effectively giving remote command execution control to the attacker. The function and variable names are obfuscated, and the domain is hardcoded and suspicious. Additionally, if the script is imported as a module (not run as main), it sends an HTTP GET request to 'http://poiqwe.info/install_bad', which is likely a beacon or tracking call. The code lacks any user interaction, consent, or legitimate application logic, and uses classic reverse shell techniques. These behaviors are hallmark indicators of malicious remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors."

      "malicious_behavior": "The code subclasses setuptools install and develop commands to perform HTTP GET requests to suspicious, hardcoded external URLs (http://poiqwe.info/install_post_dev, http://poiqwe.info/install_post, http://poiqwe.info/install_pre_dev, http://poiqwe.info/install_pre) during package installation and development setup phases. These requests occur without any user interaction or consent, embedded directly in the package setup process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The domain poiqwe.info is non-standard and unrelated to typical package sources, indicating potential command-and-control or data exfiltration behavior. The obfuscated class and method names further suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user notification surrounding these network calls. This pattern aligns with critical risk indicators for malware that execute code or communicate with attacker-controlled servers during package installation, enabling remote code execution or payload delivery. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
