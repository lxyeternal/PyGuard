      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools' install command that overrides an installation method to collect detailed system information including hostname, current working directory, fully qualified domain name, IP address, reverse DNS lookup, and the current username. It then sends this collected sensitive environment and user data via an HTTP GET request to a hardcoded, suspicious external domain ('https://cas54n1gfihn6082nil0kz451ubndy6rt.dooracle.in') without any user interaction or consent. The class and method names are obfuscated, and the network communication is embedded in the package installation process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. This behavior matches multiple critical risk indicators such as environment fingerprinting, data exfiltration to a suspicious hardcoded URL during package installation, obfuscation, and lack of legitimate application logic. Therefore, this code exhibits malicious behavior consistent with information-stealing malware embedded in a Python package installation script."
