      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a subclass of setuptools.command.install.install and overrides an install-related method to execute system commands during package installation without user consent. It collects extensive system information including OS details (via uname or systeminfo), current working directory, network configuration (ifconfig/ipconfig), public IP address (via curl ifconfig.me), username (whoami), hostname, and running processes (tasklist on Windows). It then sends all this sensitive system and user information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL, which is an external endpoint unrelated to any legitimate package functionality. This behavior is a classic example of information stealing and data exfiltration triggered automatically during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated class and variable names, execution of shell commands without validation, and immediate outbound network communication to a suspicious hardcoded webhook URL strongly indicate malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying these actions. Therefore, this code is malicious."
