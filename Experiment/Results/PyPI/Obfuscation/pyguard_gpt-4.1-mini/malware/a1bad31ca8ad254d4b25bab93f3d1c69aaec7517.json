      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple clear indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to locate and read files from local storage directories of popular applications such as Discord, Chrome, Opera, Brave, and Yandex browsers, specifically targeting files with extensions '.log' and '.ldb' within 'leveldb' folders. It uses regular expressions to extract Discord authentication tokens (patterns matching Discord token formats) from these files. The collected tokens are then compiled into a message and sent via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Discord webhook URL, which is an external, attacker-controlled endpoint. The code uses obfuscated variable and function names to hide its intent and suppresses exceptions silently to avoid detection. There is no user interaction or consent, and the data exfiltration is automatic upon execution. These behaviors align with known patterns of credential theft and data exfiltration malware, specifically targeting Discord tokens for unauthorized access or abuse. Therefore, this code is malicious."
