      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setuptools installation script, which is a known vector for supply chain attacks. The function tvrAQIYoOjmMWoRDqRHQdZafINxbURTG() collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (system fingerprinting) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://linkedopports.com/pyp/resp.php). Then, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL (https://python-release.com/python-install.scr) and writes it to disk with a suspicious filename (ini_file_pyp_41.exe). Immediately after, it executes this downloaded file using os.system('start ...'), which launches the executable without user consent or validation. The entire operation is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, hiding failures and evading detection. The malicious function is triggered automatically during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the install command, which means the payload executes silently upon package installation. The use of obfuscated function and variable names further indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. These behaviors—system fingerprinting, data exfiltration, downloading and executing untrusted code, silent failure suppression, and execution during package installation—are classic hallmarks of malware and supply chain attacks."
