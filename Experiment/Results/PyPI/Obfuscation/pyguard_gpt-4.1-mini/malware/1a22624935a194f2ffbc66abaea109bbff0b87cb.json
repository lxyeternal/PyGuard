      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It subclasses setuptools.command.install.install to override the install process, which is a known supply chain attack vector. During installation, it conditionally imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and uses a hardcoded Fernet key to decrypt an encrypted payload. This decrypted payload is then executed dynamically via exec(), enabling arbitrary code execution at install time without user consent. The use of obfuscated variable names and encrypted payload hides the true intent, which is a common evasion technique. The code targets Windows systems (os.name == 'nt') and executes the decrypted code silently during package installation, which is a critical risk pattern associated exclusively with malware. The package setup metadata is also obfuscated and suspicious (random strings for name and keywords). Overall, this is a classic example of a malicious Python package that executes hidden, encrypted code during installation, enabling remote code execution and potential further payload delivery."
