      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains a base64-encoded payload that is decoded and executed dynamically at runtime using exec and compile, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. The decoded payload imports modules to download a file from a suspicious hardcoded IP address (http://51.103.210.236:80/inject/VSpinLJKHaPMTkic), writes it to a temporary file with a .exe extension, executes it, and then deletes the temporary file. This pattern of downloading and executing a remote executable without user consent is a classic malware behavior. Additionally, the use of obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic imports, and execution of shell commands further supports the malicious nature. The code also includes Windows-specific API calls to manipulate console cursor visibility and clear the screen, which are often used in malware to control user interface behavior stealthily. Overall, the code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators such as obfuscated payload execution, remote code download and execution, and lack of user interaction or notification, confirming it is malicious."
