This pattern is a classic indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables remote code execution from an untrusted source. The code is embedded in a setup script, which can trigger execution during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before execution, increasing the risk. The use of obfuscated variable names and the absence of legitimate application logic around the network and execution actions further support the conclusion that this code is malicious."

This pattern is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution, enabling remote code execution on the victim's system. The absence of error handling, user notification, or integrity checks, combined with the use of a suspicious external domain and direct execution of the downloaded binary, strongly indicates malicious intent."
