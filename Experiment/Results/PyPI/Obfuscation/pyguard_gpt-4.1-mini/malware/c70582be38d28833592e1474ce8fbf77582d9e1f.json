      "malicious_behavior": "The provided Python code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is heavily obfuscated using base64 encoding and zlib compression, which is a common tactic to evade static analysis. The code imports numerous modules related to system information gathering, cryptography (AES), Windows-specific APIs (win32crypt), and network communication (requests, discord webhooks). It collects sensitive system information such as hardware IDs, usernames, hostnames, MAC addresses, and installed software details. It extracts and decrypts stored credentials, cookies, browser history, and payment card data from various browsers by accessing and copying SQLite databases, then decrypting them using Windows DPAPI and AES. The code kills processes related to Discord to avoid detection or interference. It sends the stolen data to attacker-controlled Discord webhooks and external URLs, indicating data exfiltration. The code also creates hidden directories, writes files with random or suspicious names, and executes downloaded or dynamically generated code. It hooks into the package installation process (setup.py) to trigger execution without user consent, a classic supply chain attack vector. The presence of blacklists for users, PCs, IPs, and processes suggests anti-analysis and evasion techniques. Overall, the code is a sophisticated information stealer and backdoor that collects and exfiltrates sensitive user data stealthily, executes arbitrary code, and maintains persistence, all hallmarks of malware."
