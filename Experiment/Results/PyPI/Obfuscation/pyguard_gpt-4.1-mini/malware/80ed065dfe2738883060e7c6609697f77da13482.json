      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a function with an obfuscated name that immediately executes a shell command using os.system to run 'wget' to download content from a hardcoded, suspicious, non-standard URL (https://kymslgsrz9xelqdvm7uxogrrnit9ha5z.oastify.com/test). This function is called directly during the setup script execution, meaning the download is triggered automatically during package installation without user interaction or consent. The use of a setup.py script to execute arbitrary shell commands that fetch data from an untrusted external domain is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. There is no validation, error handling, or legitimate application logic surrounding this network activity. The domain used is suspicious and unrelated to any known legitimate package source. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution during package installation, use of hardcoded suspicious URLs, and execution of shell commands without user consent."
