      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/jagermager999/8746465cdg78cdsxasy8a/raw/main/test.exe) without any user interaction or consent. It writes this executable to a temporary file with an obfuscated name ('tmp_file_pypi_29x7d0kf8.exe') and immediately executes it using os.system with the 'start' command on Windows. This behavior is a classic pattern of remote payload retrieval and execution, commonly used in malware for payload delivery and persistence. The code is embedded in a setup script, which means it will execute during package installation, a known supply chain attack vector. There is no validation, integrity check, or user notification before downloading and running the executable. The obfuscated function and variable names further indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code also quits immediately if not running on Windows, limiting execution to a specific platform, which is typical for targeted malware. Overall, this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior, including unsolicited download and execution of a remote binary during package installation."
