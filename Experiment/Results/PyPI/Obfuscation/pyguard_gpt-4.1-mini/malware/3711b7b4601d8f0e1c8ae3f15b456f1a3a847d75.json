      "malicious_behavior": "The code writes a Python snippet to a temporary file that imports urllib.request to fetch and execute code directly from a hardcoded external URL (https://paste.bingner.com/paste/6d6ze/raw) without any user interaction, validation, or consent. It then immediately executes this temporary file using a system shell command that launches a new Python interpreter process. This pattern of dynamically downloading and executing remote code during package setup is a classic and critical indicator of malicious behavior, as it enables arbitrary code execution on the victim's system. The use of obfuscated variable names, writing to a temporary file, and executing it via os.system further supports the intent to evade detection. This behavior is consistent with supply chain attacks and remote code execution malware, making the code highly suspicious and malicious."
