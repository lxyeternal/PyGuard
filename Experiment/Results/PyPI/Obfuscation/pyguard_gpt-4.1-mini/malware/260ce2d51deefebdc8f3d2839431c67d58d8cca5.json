      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The subprocess.Popen call uses creationflags=subprocess.CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. The code checks for the existence of a suspicious directory named 'tahg' before executing the payload, which is a common tactic to avoid repeated execution or to detect analysis environments. This execution happens at import or setup time without any user interaction or consent, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with a suspicious package name and version, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. The combination of obfuscated PowerShell execution, hidden process spawning, and execution during package setup strongly indicates malicious intent consistent with malware delivery, persistence, or remote code execution."
