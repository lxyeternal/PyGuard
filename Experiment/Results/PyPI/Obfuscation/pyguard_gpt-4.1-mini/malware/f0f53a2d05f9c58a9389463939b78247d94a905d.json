      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, indicating obfuscation to evade detection. It first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the command if it does not exist, which is a common evasion or persistence tactic. The subprocess is launched with CREATE_NO_WINDOW to suppress any visible window, further indicating stealth. This execution happens at import time or setup time without user consent or interaction, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The rest of the code is a standard setup call wrapped in a try-except that suppresses errors, likely to mask failures. Given these factors—hidden execution, obfuscated PowerShell payload, conditional execution based on directory presence, and execution during package setup—this code exhibits multiple critical risk indicators of malicious behavior."
