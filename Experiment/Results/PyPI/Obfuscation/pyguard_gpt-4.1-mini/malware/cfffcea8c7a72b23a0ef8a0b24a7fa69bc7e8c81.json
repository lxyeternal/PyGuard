      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the install process in a setuptools setup script. During installation, if the operating system is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), it imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and then decrypts a hardcoded encrypted payload using a hardcoded Fernet key. The decrypted payload is executed immediately via exec(). This pattern of decrypting and executing code at install time without user consent is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during package installation (setup.py) is consistent with malware behavior. The code also specifies 'setup_requires' for 'fernet' and 'requests', which are used only in the malicious payload execution. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction, and the payload is executed silently during installation, which can lead to arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine. Therefore, this code contains malicious behavior."
