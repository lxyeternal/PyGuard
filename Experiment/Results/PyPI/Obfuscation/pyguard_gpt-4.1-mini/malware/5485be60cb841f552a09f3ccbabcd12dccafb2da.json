      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains malicious behavior. It embeds a base64-encoded shell command that is executed during the package installation process (in the AfterInstall class's run method). The decoded command uses 'curl' to silently download a file named 'strings.bat' from a suspicious external URL (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1169414844689174588/1188945374312943665/strings.bat) into a temporary directory and then executes it via 'start /min cmd /c'. This pattern is a classic supply chain attack vector where arbitrary code is fetched and executed without user consent during package installation. The use of base64 encoding to hide the command, the hardcoded external URL pointing to a Discord CDN (not a standard or trusted package source), and the execution of a downloaded batch file all strongly indicate malicious intent. This behavior enables remote code execution on the victim's system, potentially leading to further compromise, persistence, or payload delivery. There is no legitimate application logic or user interaction justifying this network fetch and execution, making it a high-risk malicious pattern."
