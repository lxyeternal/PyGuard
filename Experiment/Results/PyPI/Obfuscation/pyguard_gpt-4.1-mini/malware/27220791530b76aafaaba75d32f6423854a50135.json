      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL (a MediaFire link hosting 'supra.exe') directly into the Windows Startup folder under a misleading name 'minecraft_servers.exe'. This is a classic persistence technique to ensure the executable runs on user login without consent. Immediately after downloading, the code executes this file using subprocess.call, suppressing stdout and stderr, which indicates an attempt to hide execution details. The entire operation occurs without any user interaction or notification, embedded within a setup script, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of environment variables to construct the path, writing to a sensitive user directory (Startup folder), fetching and executing a remote executable, and suppressing output are all strong indicators of malicious intent. There is no legitimate application logic or validation, and the behavior matches multiple critical risk patterns associated with malware, including remote payload retrieval, persistence establishment, and arbitrary code execution during package installation."
