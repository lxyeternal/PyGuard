      "malicious_behavior": "The code attempts to execute a hidden PowerShell command using subprocess.Popen with the '-WindowStyle Hidden' and '-EncodedCommand' flags, which is a well-known technique for stealthy execution of obfuscated payloads. The encoded command is base64-encoded UTF-16LE PowerShell script, which is typically used to evade static detection. The code first checks for the existence of a directory named 'tahg' and only runs the hidden PowerShell command if it does not exist, indicating conditional execution likely to evade repeated detection or analysis. This behavior is embedded in what appears to be a setup script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks and arbitrary code execution during package installation. The use of subprocess to spawn a hidden PowerShell process with an encoded command, combined with the lack of any legitimate application logic or user interaction, strongly indicates malicious intent. The rest of the code calls distutils.core.setup with generic metadata, likely to disguise the malicious payload as a legitimate package. Overall, this pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including stealth execution, obfuscation, execution during installation, and lack of transparency or user consent."
