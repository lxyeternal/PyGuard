      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class subclassing setuptools.command.install.install, which overrides a method that is called during installation. Inside this method, it checks if the OS is Windows (os.name == 'nt'), then imports 'requests' and 'fernet' modules and executes decrypted code using Fernet symmetric encryption. The encrypted payload is hardcoded and decrypted at install time, then executed via exec(). This pattern of embedding encrypted payloads in setup/install scripts and executing them during package installation is a classic supply chain attack vector and a strong indicator of malicious intent. The use of obfuscated variable names, encrypted payload, and execution during installation without user consent matches multiple critical risk indicators for malware, including arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscation, and use of external dependencies for malicious activity. The code does not perform any legitimate setup tasks but instead runs hidden, decrypted code, which is a hallmark of malicious behavior."
