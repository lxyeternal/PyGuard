      "malicious_behavior": "The code contains clear malicious behavior. It uses base64 decoding and dynamic execution (exec and compile) of the decoded payload during the setup process, which is a classic supply chain attack vector. The decoded payload imports 'tempfile' and 'sys', then writes and executes code fetched from a suspicious hardcoded URL 'http://20.224.2.213/inject/ctE6toLDoHBBjApi' without any user interaction or consent. This behavior is indicative of remote code execution and payload delivery. The use of obfuscation via base64 encoding, dynamic imports, and execution in the setup script, combined with fetching and executing code from a non-standard IP address, strongly indicates malicious intent. This pattern matches multiple critical risk indicators such as arbitrary code execution at install time, obfuscated payload delivery, and network communication with suspicious endpoints, all without user notification or validation."
