      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It collects sensitive environment information such as the username (from USER environment variable), hostname (from HOSTNAME environment variable and socket.gethostname()), and current working directory. It then sends this information via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, hardcoded external URL (https://en0w6ukj0qarx.x.pipedream.net/), which is a known service often used for capturing exfiltrated data. Subsequently, the code creates a raw TCP socket connection to a hardcoded external domain (4.tcp.eu.ngrok.io) on port 19931 and duplicates the socket's file descriptor to standard input, output, and error (os.dup2 calls). This is a classic technique to redirect the shell's input/output to the network socket. Finally, it spawns an interactive shell (pty.spawn('sh')), effectively creating a reverse shell that allows remote command execution on the victim machine. The function and class names are obfuscated and do not correspond to any legitimate application logic. There is no user interaction, consent, or legitimate business logic justifying these actions. These behaviors are consistent with remote access trojans (RATs) or backdoors used for unauthorized remote control and data exfiltration. Therefore, this code is malicious."
