      "malicious_behavior": "The code downloads an executable file from a hardcoded, suspicious URL hosted on Discord's CDN (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895995437457227806/997202935404568606/tser4.exe) without any user interaction or validation. It writes this executable content to a batch file named 'tser.bat' and immediately executes it using os.system. This pattern of fetching a remote executable and running it directly is a classic hallmark of malware delivery and execution. Additionally, the class and function names are obfuscated and the threading usage is incorrect (calling a non-existent 'main' method), which may be an attempt to evade detection or analysis. The absence of error handling, user consent, or any legitimate application logic further supports the conclusion that this code is malicious."
