      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom install command class that overrides the installation process of a Python package. During installation, it collects extensive system information including OS details (via 'uname -a' or 'systeminfo'), current working directory, network configuration ('ifconfig' or 'ipconfig'), public IP address (via 'curl ifconfig.me'), current user ('whoami'), and hostname. It then sends all this sensitive system information in a JSON payload via an HTTP POST request to a hardcoded Slack webhook URL. This exfiltration of detailed system and network information without user consent or notification is a classic malicious behavior pattern. The code is embedded in the package's setup script, triggering automatically on installation, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of obfuscated variable names and the hardcoded external webhook URL further indicate intent to hide malicious activity. There is no legitimate application logic justifying this data collection and exfiltration, making this code a clear example of malicious behavior."
