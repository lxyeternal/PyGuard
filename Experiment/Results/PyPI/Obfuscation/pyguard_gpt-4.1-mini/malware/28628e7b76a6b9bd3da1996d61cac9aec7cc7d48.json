      "malicious_behavior": "The code defines a custom installation command class that overrides the standard setuptools install command. During the installation process, it executes a shell command via os.system that opens a reverse shell connection to a hardcoded external IP address (114.116.119.253) on port 7777 using bash. This behavior is a classic indicator of a remote access trojan (RAT) or reverse shell payload, enabling unauthorized remote control of the victim's system. The execution of this command happens automatically during package installation without any user interaction or consent, which is a known supply chain attack vector. The use of a hardcoded IP address and direct shell command execution in the install hook is strongly associated with malicious intent and is never observed in benign software. Therefore, this code contains critical malicious behavior."
