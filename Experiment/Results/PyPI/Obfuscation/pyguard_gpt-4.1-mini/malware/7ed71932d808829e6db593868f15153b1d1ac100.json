      "malicious_behavior": "The code exhibits multiple strong indicators of malicious behavior. It is embedded in a setuptools installation script, which is a common vector for supply chain attacks. The function cVohYmOzpYpiXnTvOwtCitUtcxEePkGz() collects the COMPUTERNAME environment variable (system fingerprinting) and sends it via an HTTP GET request to a suspicious, non-standard external domain 'linkedopports.com'. Then, if the platform is Windows, it downloads an executable file from another suspicious URL 'https://python-release.com/python-install.scr' and saves it as 'ini_file_pyp_41.exe' without any validation or user consent. Immediately after, it executes this downloaded file using os.system('start ...'), which launches the executable on the victim's machine. The entire operation is wrapped in a try-except block that suppresses all exceptions, hiding any errors and evading detection. The malicious function is triggered automatically during the package installation process by subclassing setuptools.command.install.install and overriding the install command, which means the payload executes without user interaction or consent. The use of obfuscated function and variable names further indicates an attempt to hide malicious intent. These behaviors—system fingerprinting, exfiltration of system info to suspicious domains, downloading and executing untrusted code during package installation without user consent—are classic hallmarks of malware and supply chain attacks."
