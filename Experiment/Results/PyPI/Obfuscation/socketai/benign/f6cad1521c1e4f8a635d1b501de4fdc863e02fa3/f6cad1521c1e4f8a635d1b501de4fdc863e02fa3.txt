The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard subprocess management utility with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The malware score is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is moderate to high (~0.7). Overall, the code appears benign, but obfuscation warrants cautious review in broader context."
