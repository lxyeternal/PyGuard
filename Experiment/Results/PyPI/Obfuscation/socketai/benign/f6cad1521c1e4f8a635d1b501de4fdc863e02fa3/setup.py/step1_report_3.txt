  "purpose": "This script is a setup configuration for a Python package, defining package metadata and reading version info from a file.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from a file specified by relpath parameter",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data outputs or external communications",
  "flows": "read() function reads from a file, then regex extracts version info",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function names; dynamic path handling; regex searches for version string in files; no evident malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for file path resolution and reading file content, then extracts a version string using regex. The setup() function uses standard metadata and module info, with no evidence of dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior. Function names are intentionally obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or hidden behaviors detected. The pattern is consistent with typical package setup scripts, with no malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated function names but no malicious intent. No malware or security risks identified.",
