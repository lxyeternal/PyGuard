  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be a stylistic or automated artifact rather than an indicator of sabotage. The malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score around 0.65, and the security risk score low (~0.15), consistent with the analysis."
