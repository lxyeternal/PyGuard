  "purpose": "Assigning a version string to a variable",
  "sources": "Assignment statement: XwRdIGGAGGNAnOVHVFbDWVoZbWwkRbUG = \"1.9.1\"",
  "sinks": "The code simply assigns a string value; no sinks involved",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated and nonsensical, which could indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent; however, no malicious behavior is evident",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single line assigning a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no input sources, no data leaks, no network activity, or other suspicious actions. The obfuscated variable name might suggest hiding intent, but with no additional code, it's harmless.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks; it is a benign assignment with obfuscated variable naming that does not indicate malicious intent.",
