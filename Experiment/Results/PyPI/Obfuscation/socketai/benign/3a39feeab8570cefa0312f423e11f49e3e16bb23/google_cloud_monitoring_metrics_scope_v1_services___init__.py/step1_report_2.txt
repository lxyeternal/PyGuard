  "purpose": "No functional purpose provided; the code contains only a coding declaration.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No data output, network communication, or sensitive operation is evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are detectable.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a coding declaration with no actual executable statements, no imports, no variables, and no logic. This is unusual and suggests incomplete or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is only a header specifying UTF-8 encoding with no functional content. There are no data sources, no code execution paths, and no suspicious activities. Given the minimal content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues. The code appears to be an incomplete snippet or a placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is essentially empty apart from the encoding declaration. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. The overall security risk is negligible, and there is no malware indication. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the lack of any substantive code.",
