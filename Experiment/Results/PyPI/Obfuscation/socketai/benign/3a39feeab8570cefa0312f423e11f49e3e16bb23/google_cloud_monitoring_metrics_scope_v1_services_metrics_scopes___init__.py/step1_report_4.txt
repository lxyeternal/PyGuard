  "purpose": "Re-exporting classes MetricsScopesClient and MetricsScopesAsyncClient for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .async_client and .client",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only re-exports classes without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Imported classes have obscure, non-descriptive names (kCEdHwFuQYUYxqyIuIBHTdLzAQOcSdVl and TMDVMcByALlUwudrpmPcwZdZFsZvBsKK), indicating potential obfuscation or placeholder names. No other suspicious code or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports two classes with non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated names from local modules and exposes them through __all__ for public use. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation techniques beyond obfuscated class names. The pattern suggests typical package re-exporting, though the class names could be intentionally obfuscated, which warrants cautious review of the source modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward module re-export, possibly with obfuscated class names. No direct malicious behavior detected in this snippet. The obfuscation of class names is unusual but not necessarily malicious. Further review of the source modules is recommended to ensure they do not contain malicious code.",
