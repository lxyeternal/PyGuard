  "purpose": "Module exports two client classes with obfuscated names, likely for an SDK or API interface.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.async_client and .client) with obfuscated class names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class names, which could conceal malicious code or proprietary complexity.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated names and exposing them via __all__. No logic, data handling, or external interactions are visible. The obfuscated class names are suspicious but not proof of malicious intent; they could be auto-generated or proprietary. The scores from reports assign low malware suspicion (around 0.2), high obfuscation suspicion (around 0.75), and low security risk (around 0.2), which are consistent with the evidence. Further review of the actual class implementations is necessary to confirm whether the obfuscation conceals malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation but the obfuscated class names warrant further inspection of their definitions. The current scores are appropriate, reflecting low malware likelihood but moderate suspicion due to obfuscation. No active malicious behavior is evident in this snippet.",
