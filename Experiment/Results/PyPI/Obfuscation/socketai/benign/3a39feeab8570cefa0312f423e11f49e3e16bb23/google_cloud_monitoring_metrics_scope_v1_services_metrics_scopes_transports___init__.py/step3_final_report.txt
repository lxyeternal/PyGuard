{
  "purpose": "Organizes imported transport classes into an ordered dictionary for gRPC communication and exposes them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.base, .grpc, .grpc_asyncio).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or data handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports -> OrderedDict assignment -> __all__ declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, likely due to code generation or obfuscation, but no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes/functions from local modules, stores them in an OrderedDict with obfuscated variable names, and defines __all__ for public API exposure. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling that could indicate malicious intent. The obfuscated names are typical of auto-generated code and do not imply malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward and aligns with standard module setup practices. No vulnerabilities, malicious code, or suspicious data flows are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard module setup for organizing and exporting transport classes. No signs of malware or security risks are evident. The obfuscation is superficial and likely due to code generation, not malicious intent.",
