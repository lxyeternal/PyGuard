  "conclusion": "The code functions as a serialization utility with class registration and integrity checks. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The overall security risk is low, but obfuscation and dynamic modifications should be reviewed further in security-sensitive contexts."
