  "purpose": "Read the contents of a file named 'version.txt' located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the file 'version.txt' located relative to the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "The data read from 'version.txt' is stored in a variable; no sinks such as network or database operations are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the file 'version.txt' into the variable 'bAEdjhzhExqfPyowZsEyeCaLdwjmKgxs' without further processing or output.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name is a long, nonsensical string, which could suggest obfuscation, but this alone is not conclusive. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code resolves the script's directory path and reads the contents of 'version.txt' in that directory with UTF-8 encoding. The variable name used to store the data appears intentionally obscure, which could be suspicious, but there are no other indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior. No network, system modifications, or other potentially harmful operations are performed.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply reads a text file located in the same directory as the script and stores its contents in an obfuscated variable. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
