  "purpose": "Read the contents of a version.txt file located in the same directory as the script.",
  "sources": "Reading from a file located at __file__ directory + 'version.txt'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink such as network transmission or database access; the data is stored in a variable.",
  "flows": "File content is read from the filesystem and assigned to a variable; no flow to external sinks or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code structures. Variable name appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code resolves the current script's directory path, constructs a path to 'version.txt', and reads its contents into a variable with UTF-8 encoding. No external input is taken from untrusted sources other than the filesystem. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or obfuscated malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple file read operation with no malicious intent. It does not perform any suspicious actions or contain malware indicators. The obfuscated variable name is likely for obscurity but not malicious.",
