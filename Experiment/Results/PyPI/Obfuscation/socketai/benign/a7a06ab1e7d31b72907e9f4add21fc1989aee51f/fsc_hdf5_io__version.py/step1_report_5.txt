{
  "purpose": "Read the content of a 'version.txt' file located in the same directory as the script",
  "sources": "Reading from a file located relative to the script's directory (__file__)",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data output or network operations",
  "flows": "File read source to variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated variable name; no evident malicious code or backdoors",
  "analysis": "The code resolves the current script's directory, constructs a path to 'version.txt', and reads its contents into a variable. No user input, network activity, or other potentially malicious behavior is present. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is straightforward and serves a configuration or versioning purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simply reading a local file with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise.",
