  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and indirect data handling, raising suspicion but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score is appropriate, but the high obfuscation warrants caution. Additional review of the external function and deobfuscation are advised before deployment."
