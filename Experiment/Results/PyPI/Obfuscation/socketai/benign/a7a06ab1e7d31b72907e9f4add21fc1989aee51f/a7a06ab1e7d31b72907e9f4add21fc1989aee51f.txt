Obfuscation is likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. External functions should be verified separately, but based on their usage, they seem standard. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible."

The low malware score is appropriate, but the high obfuscation warrants caution. Additional review of the external function and deobfuscation are advised before deployment."

Overall, the security posture is benign, with scores reflecting minor obfuscation but no active threats."

The risk is moderate primarily because of obfuscation and lack of input validation. It appears to be legitimate but should be reviewed further if used in security-sensitive contexts."

Obfuscation alone does not justify high malware risk, but warrants cautious review. Overall, the code is low risk with minimal malicious indicators."
