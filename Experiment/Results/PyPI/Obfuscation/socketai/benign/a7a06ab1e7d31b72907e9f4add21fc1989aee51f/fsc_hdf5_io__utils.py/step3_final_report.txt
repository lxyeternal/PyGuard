  "purpose": "Utility function to decode bytes to string if needed",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'meFbuGrUBYksazbyhJDhIEcydNHmAMUB' (can be str or bytes)",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted data handling beyond local decoding",
  "flows": "Input -> isinstance check -> decode if bytes -> return string",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, but no malicious patterns or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward operation: if input is bytes, decode using UTF-8; if already string, return as is. No network activity, no data leaks, no secrets, no backdoors. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. Malware score is zero; security risk is minimal (~0.1). The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), justified by the variable naming. The code is benign and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for decoding bytes to strings. No malicious behavior or security issues are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
