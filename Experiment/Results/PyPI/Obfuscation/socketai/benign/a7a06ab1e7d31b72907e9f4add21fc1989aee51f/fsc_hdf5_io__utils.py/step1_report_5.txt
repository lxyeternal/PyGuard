  "purpose": "The function 'AthhaEaZEKOnomdAMEGJgVdBUZlqfhYS' decodes bytes to a UTF-8 string if the input is bytes; otherwise, it returns the input string unchanged.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'meFbuGrUBYksazbyhJDhIEcydNHmAMUB' which can be a string or bytes.",
  "sinks": "The decode method on bytes, which converts bytes to string, and the return of the string itself.",
  "flows": "Bytes input → decode to string → return string; String input → return unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable and function names; no external data sources, no environment variables, no network or file operations; straightforward decoding logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple utility function that checks if the input is bytes and decodes it to a UTF-8 string if so, otherwise it returns the input as is. There are no suspicious external data sources, network connections, or malicious code behaviors. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but hinder readability. No hardcoded credentials, no data leakage, or malicious logic detected. The function performs a basic data format check and conversion.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving a simple utility purpose without malicious behavior. Its obfuscation is likely for code hiding or style, but no malicious actions are evident.",
