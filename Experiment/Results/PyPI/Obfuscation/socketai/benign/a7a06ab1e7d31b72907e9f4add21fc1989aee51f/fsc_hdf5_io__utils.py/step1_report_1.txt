  "purpose": "Decode input data to string if it is in bytes format",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'meFbuGrUBYksazbyhJDhIEcydNHmAMUB', which can be str or bytes",
  "sinks": "Return statement outputs a string; no external sinks or data leaks evident",
  "flows": "Input data -> type check -> decoding if bytes -> return string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, file manipulation, or external interactions present.",
  "analysis": "The function checks if the input is of type bytes and decodes it using UTF-8; otherwise, it returns the input as is. The code is simple and does not perform any external operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. The obfuscated variable names do not imply malicious intent but hinder readability. No malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward utility function for decoding bytes to strings with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be for code concealment but does not indicate malicious intent.",
