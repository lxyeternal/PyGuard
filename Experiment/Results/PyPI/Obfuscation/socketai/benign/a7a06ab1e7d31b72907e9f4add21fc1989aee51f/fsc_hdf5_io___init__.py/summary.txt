  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package initialization script with minimal obfuscation that does not indicate malicious intent. The observed obfuscated variable is likely benign but warrants further review of the _version module. Overall, the security posture is benign, with scores reflecting minor obfuscation but no active threats."
