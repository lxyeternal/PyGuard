  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data input points such as environment variables, network requests, dynamic code execution functions (e.g., eval, exec), file operations, and hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows leading to code execution, data exfiltration, network communication, or modification of system files.",
  "flows": "Sources like environment variables or input functions to sinks such as eval/exec, network sockets, or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation detected; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious constructs explicitly present; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets, based on summaries, show standard data processing and network interactions without evidence of malicious intent. The absence of obfuscation and malicious patterns justifies low malware scores. Slightly elevated security risk scores in some reports reflect potential unsafe practices (e.g., network use, dynamic execution), but no concrete malicious activity is identified. Confidence levels are moderate to high, given the lack of actual code snippets, and the reasoning aligns with the scores assigned.",
  "conclusion": "All reports' scores are consistent with their reasoning. No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The moderate security risk scores are justified by potential unsafe practices but do not indicate active threats. Overall, the dependency appears benign with low risk.",
