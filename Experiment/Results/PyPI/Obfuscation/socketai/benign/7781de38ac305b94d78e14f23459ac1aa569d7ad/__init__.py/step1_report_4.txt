  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely indicating package version.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Single variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name; no other code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a single line assigning a version string to a variable named 'oSXJtqiESUCvgUrNzgyycoVhMoRVUaHg'. The variable name appears random, which could be obfuscation, but no malicious actions or data leaks are evident. No input sources, no data processing, and no suspicious behavior are present. The code appears benign and possibly autogenerated or obfuscated just in variable naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment of a version string with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
