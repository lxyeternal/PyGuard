      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, image decoding utility for barcode/QR code processing. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and low-level memory handling suggest potential misuse if exploited. Overall, the malware likelihood is low, but the obfuscation and memory access justify a moderate security concern. Further review and runtime analysis are recommended before deployment in security-sensitive contexts."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a platform-dependent library loader with obfuscated identifiers. While no evidence of malicious behavior is present, the obfuscation and lack of validation pose security risks if libraries are replaced or environment is manipulated. The overall malware likelihood is low, but the potential for exploitation exists, warranting cautious review and validation measures."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a minimal exception class with an obfuscated name. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The current security scores are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate to high, and overall risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard, obfuscated binding layer for a barcode scanning library. There are no signs of malware or malicious activity. The primary security consideration is ensuring the trustworthiness of the external shared library and proper input validation. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious."
