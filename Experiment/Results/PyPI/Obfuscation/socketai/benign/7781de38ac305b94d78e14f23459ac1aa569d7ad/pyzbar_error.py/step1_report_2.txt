{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class and an error class for use in a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The code sets a module-level list __all__ and defines a class zFuPQAuFPWqlJtlselxJEAHDpPdIzNzG that inherits from Exception.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or data processing present; no source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "The class name zFuPQAuFPWqlJtlselxJEAHDpPdIzNzG appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be suspicious or indicate hiding intent. The __all__ list contains only a generic exception name.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a module export list and a single custom exception class with a complex, obfuscated name. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing. The obfuscated class name may be an attempt to hide its purpose, but without other context, it is not inherently malicious. The code itself is minimal and does not perform any operations or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to define a custom exception with an obfuscated name, which might be used elsewhere in a larger codebase. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity based on this snippet alone. The obfuscation could be benign or a minimal attempt to hide code details.",
