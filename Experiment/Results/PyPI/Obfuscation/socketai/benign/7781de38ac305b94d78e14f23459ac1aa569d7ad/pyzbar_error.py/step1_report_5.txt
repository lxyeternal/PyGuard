{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class and an error class for a module likely related to barcode or QR code processing.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it only declares an exception class and an exception list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'zFuPQAuFPWqlJtlselxJEAHDpPdIzNzG' is an obfuscated or randomly generated string, which is unusual for publicly distributed code but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists of a list with a single string element and a class definition for a custom exception. The class name appears obfuscated, which could be suspicious but might also be an intentional obfuscation or code-generation. There are no data flows, external calls, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, credential handling, or code execution. The simplicity suggests it is part of a larger codebase, possibly for error handling.",
  "conclusion": "There are no overt malicious behaviors in this code snippet. The obfuscated class name warrants some scrutiny, but it alone does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign, serving as error handling infrastructure.",
