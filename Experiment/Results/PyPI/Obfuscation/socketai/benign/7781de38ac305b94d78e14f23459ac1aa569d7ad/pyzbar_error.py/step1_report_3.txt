{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for a module related to PyZbar, likely used for barcode or QR code processing.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines a constant list and a class.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code only contains class and variable declarations.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'zFuPQAuFPWqlJtlselxJEAHDpPdIzNzG' appears obfuscated, which is unusual for a standard exception class; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class with an obfuscated name and an exported list containing a single string 'PyZbarError'. The class does not include any methods or behaviors, and there is no code that processes or manipulates data. The obfuscation of the class name could be suspicious, but it might also be an attempt to conceal purpose or prevent easy detection. Overall, there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, obfuscated definition of a custom exception class related to a barcode processing library, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. The obfuscation is unusual but not necessarily malicious.",
