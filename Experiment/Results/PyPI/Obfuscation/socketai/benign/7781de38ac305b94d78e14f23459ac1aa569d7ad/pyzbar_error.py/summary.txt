  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a minimal exception class with an obfuscated name. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The current security scores are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate to high, and overall risk is low."
