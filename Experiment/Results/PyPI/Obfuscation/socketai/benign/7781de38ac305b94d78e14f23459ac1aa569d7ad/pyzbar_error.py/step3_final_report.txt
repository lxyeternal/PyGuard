{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name and exports 'PyZbarError' for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "The class declaration and the __all__ list, which indicates exported symbols.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or external data flows; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code only declares a class and a list.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'zFuPQAuFPWqlJtlselxJEAHDpPdIzNzG' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual for a standard exception class.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, defining an exception class with an obfuscated name and an export list. No malicious code, data handling, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated class name raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.6-0.8, risk: 0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with obfuscation being the primary concern. No evidence suggests malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a minimal exception class with an obfuscated name. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The current security scores are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate to high, and overall risk is low.",
