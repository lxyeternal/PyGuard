{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for the package, likely related to 'PyZbarError' errors.",
  "sources": "The list '__all__' defining exported symbols; the class 'zFuPQAuFPWqlJtlselxJEAHDpPdIzNzG' that inherits from Exception.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only declares a symbol and a class definition.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'zFuPQAuFPWqlJtlselxJEAHDpPdIzNzG' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code declares a list '__all__' with a single string 'PyZbarError', suggesting the package is related to barcode processing errors. It also defines a class with a complex, seemingly random name inheriting from Exception, possibly obfuscation to conceal its purpose or avoid detection. There are no data inputs, external calls, or malicious behaviors. The unusual class name may indicate obfuscation or concealment, but no malicious code or malware indicators are present. Overall, the code is minimal, intended for exception handling, with no evident malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply declares an exception class and an exported symbol related to 'PyZbarError'. The obfuscated class name may raise suspicion but does not exhibit malicious behavior. It appears to be a benign part of a larger package, with no security risks or malware present.",
