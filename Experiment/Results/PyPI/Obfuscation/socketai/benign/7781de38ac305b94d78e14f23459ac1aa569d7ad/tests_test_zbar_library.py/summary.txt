  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated test suite for verifying library loading behavior across platforms. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation does not correlate with malicious intent, and the low malware and risk scores are appropriate."
