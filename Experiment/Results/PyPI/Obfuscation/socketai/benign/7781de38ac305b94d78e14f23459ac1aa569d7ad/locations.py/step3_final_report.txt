  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for spatial computations: bounding box and convex hull calculations using standard algorithms.",
  "sources": "Coordinate lists passed as input to functions, used internally for calculations.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows; all operations are in-memory computations.",
  "flows": "Input coordinate data flows through geometric algorithms to produce bounding box and convex hull outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no suspicious code patterns or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard geometric algorithms (bounding box via min/max coordinates, convex hull via Graham scan). Variable obfuscation is present but consistent and does not indicate malicious intent. No external system interactions, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. The functions operate solely on provided coordinate data, with no signs of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of geometric utility functions with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. The low security risk score is appropriate given the code's nature.",
