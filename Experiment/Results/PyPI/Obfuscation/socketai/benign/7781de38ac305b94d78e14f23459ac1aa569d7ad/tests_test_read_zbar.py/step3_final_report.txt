  "purpose": "Unit test suite for barcode and QR code reading using pyzbar, reading specific image files and verifying decoded output.",
  "sources": "Reads image files 'qrcode.png' and 'code128.png' from the same directory; imports decoding function from pyzbar.",
  "sinks": "Captures stdout during decoding to verify output strings.",
  "flows": "Reads image files -> decodes barcode data -> captures stdout -> compares to expected strings based on Python version.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; invalid call 'unittest.FLoBEPpxzTgxmsSiXBOlGUKKIOuGSPVS()' at the end, likely a typo or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs local file reads, barcode decoding, and output verification. Obfuscated names suggest intentional obfuscation but no malicious activity. The invalid final call would cause execution failure but does not indicate malicious intent. Conditional strings based on Python version are unusual but likely for compatibility. No network activity, secrets, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated test suite for barcode reading. No malware or security risks are detected. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for evasion, not malicious. The invalid call is a bug or obfuscation artifact but does not imply malicious intent.",
