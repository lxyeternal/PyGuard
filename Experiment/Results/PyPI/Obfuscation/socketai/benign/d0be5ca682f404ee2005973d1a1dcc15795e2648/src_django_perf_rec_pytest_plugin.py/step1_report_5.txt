{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set a global boolean flag to True when the function is called.",
  "sources": "No external input or data is read; the code does not accept or process untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not write or transmit data.",
  "flows": "The function modifies a global variable; there are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and a function with a non-descriptive name, possibly to conceal intent. No other suspicious or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a future feature, defines a global variable set to False initially, and provides a function that sets this variable to True. There are no input sources, no data processing, no output, and no suspicious behaviors such as network access or system modification. The obfuscated variable name may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions or security-critical operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names and minimal functionality do not indicate malicious intent, but the naming could be suspicious if part of a larger context.",
