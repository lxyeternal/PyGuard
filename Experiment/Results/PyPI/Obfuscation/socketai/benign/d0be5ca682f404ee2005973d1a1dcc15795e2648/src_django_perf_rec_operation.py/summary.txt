  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a resource or configuration monitoring utility with high obfuscation and dynamic class handling. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The low malware score (0.2) and moderate risk score (0.3) are appropriate, with high obfuscation (0.7) justified. Overall, the code is likely benign but warrants cautious review due to obfuscation and dynamic behavior."
