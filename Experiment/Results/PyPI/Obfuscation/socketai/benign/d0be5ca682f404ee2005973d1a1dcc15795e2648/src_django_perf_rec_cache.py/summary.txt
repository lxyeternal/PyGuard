  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated cache monitoring utility with obfuscated elements. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The obfuscation and dynamic wrapping could be exploited if misused, but in its current form, it appears benign. Scores are consistent with this assessment."
