  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n- The code is a standard setup for performance recording and testing, with conditional import of pytest and importing functions from 'django_perf_rec.api'.\n- Obfuscated variable and function names suggest possible concealment but no direct malicious activity is evident.\n- Malware score: 0.1 — very low, consistent with benign performance setup.\n- Security risk: 0.2 — low, mainly due to obfuscation.\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on obfuscated identifiers.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior; code appears to prepare testing/performance hooks.\n- Malware score: 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- Security risk: 0.1 — minimal.\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n- Same pattern: conditional pytest import, obfuscated function names, no suspicious data flows.\n- Obfuscation raises suspicion but no malicious actions.\n- Malware score: 0.0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n- Consistent with previous reports; setup code with obfuscated names.\n- No evidence of malicious activity.\n- Malware score: 0.0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n- Similar pattern: setup for testing/performance, obfuscated identifiers, no malicious behavior.\n- Malware score: 0.0.\n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence of concern:** All reports describe code that is primarily setup for testing or performance monitoring, with obfuscated identifiers.\n- **Malicious activity:** No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, system modification, or other malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscation:** Consistent across reports, possibly to hide intent, but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** The code could be exploited if the imported modules are compromised, but the code itself does not introduce vulnerabilities.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The malware scores should remain very low (close to 0), as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscation should be flagged for review, but it does not automatically imply malicious intent.\n- The security risk scores are appropriate given the obfuscation but are not high because the code is benign in isolation.\n\n### Final estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0.0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 — high, due to obfuscated identifiers.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, primarily due to obfuscation and conditional imports, but no active threats.\n\n**Overall, this appears to be a benign setup script with obfuscation that warrants cautious review but does not constitute a security threat.**",
