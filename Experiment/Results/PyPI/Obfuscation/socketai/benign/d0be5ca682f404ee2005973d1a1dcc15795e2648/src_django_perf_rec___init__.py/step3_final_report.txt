  "purpose": "Setup for testing and performance recording with conditional pytest integration and imported API functions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from __future__, pytest import (conditional), imports from django_perf_rec.api",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows identified; no network or system modifications observed",
  "flows": "Conditional import flow of pytest -> registration of assert rewrite -> import of API functions",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, use of try-except for optional import, import of specific API functions with non-descriptive names",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional import of pytest, registers assertion rewrite if available, and imports several functions from django_perf_rec.api with obfuscated names. It defines __all__ with standard identifiers. No data flows or malicious actions are evident. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal intent but does not demonstrate malicious activity. The code appears to be a setup routine for testing or performance measurement in a Django environment. The low malware score (around 0.1), low security risk (around 0.2), and high obfuscation score (around 0.75) are consistent with this assessment. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for testing/performance with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The low malware and risk scores are justified. Continuous source verification is recommended, but overall, the supply chain risk appears low.",
