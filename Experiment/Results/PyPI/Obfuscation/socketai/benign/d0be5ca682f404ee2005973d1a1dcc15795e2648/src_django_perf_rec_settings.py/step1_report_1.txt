{
  "purpose": "This code provides an interface to access configuration settings, primarily related to 'HIDE_COLUMNS' and 'MODE', from Django settings or defaults.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data from 'settings.PERF_REC' and default hardcoded dictionary 'xbgNZhrWlJnJsXcndxWNybBcoApRWYtu'.",
  "sinks": "Data from 'settings.PERF_REC' or the default dictionary could be returned and used elsewhere; no direct data leakage or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "Input (configuration key) -> 'UBGactNcgvwVhTcMdQnlZbXXroWvlMVW' method -> returned value, potentially influenced by external 'settings.PERF_REC' -> used in properties.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic access to 'settings.PERF_REC' is typical, but reliance on external settings could pose a risk if 'settings.PERF_REC' is maliciously altered, though this is a standard pattern. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that accesses configuration parameters from Django settings or defaults. It includes error handling for missing keys. The configuration values control display modes and visibility flags. There are no signs of obfuscated or malicious code, such as code injection, network communication, or data exfiltration. The pattern is typical for application configuration management, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard configuration access wrapper without malicious behavior. It does not perform any harmful actions or external communications. It reads configuration data safely and returns properties based on these configurations.",
