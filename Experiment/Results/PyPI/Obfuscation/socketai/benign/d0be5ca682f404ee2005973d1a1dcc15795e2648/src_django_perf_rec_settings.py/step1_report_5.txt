  "purpose": "The code appears to manage configuration settings related to 'PERF_REC' with some properties for visibility and mode.",
  "sources": "Access to 'settings.PERF_REC' and class attributes",
  "sinks": "Potential access to 'settings.PERF_REC' which may contain sensitive data, but no data leaks or insecure operations are evident",
  "flows": "Reading from 'settings.PERF_REC' and returning configuration values through class properties",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute access and properties that depend on external settings, but no hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with a method that retrieves values from Django settings or a default dictionary. Properties interpret these values, with validation in place. No suspicious input sources or sinks such as network calls, file operations, or code execution are present. The logic is straightforward and focuses on configuration management without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard configuration wrapper class, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It safely accesses and exposes configuration data without dangerous operations.",
