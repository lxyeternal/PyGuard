  "purpose": "This code defines a class to access configuration settings related to display modes and visibility options, likely for a Django web application.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration data from django.conf.settings.PERF_REC and internal class attribute xbgNZhrWlJnJsXcndxWNybBcoApRWYtu.",
  "sinks": "Returns configuration values that influence display behavior; no data output or external network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configuration storage (settings or internal defaults) through methods to property getters, no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code; the code primarily reads configuration data with minimal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods to access configuration parameters, with defaults and validation (assert). It uses Django settings and internal defaults; no external input, network, or file operations are present. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears straightforward and standard for configuration handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration accessor class with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It primarily retrieves settings with fallback defaults and exposes properties for visibility and mode configurations.",
