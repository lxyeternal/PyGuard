      "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup with suspicious obfuscated assertions involving a non-standard 'setuptools' attribute. No malware or malicious activity is detected, but the obfuscation and invalid attribute access warrant further review. The main red flag is the assertion on 'setuptools.AdykEqPjOHLVVWyFdIkvxAxOLoaBVPYl', which is likely an obfuscation or sabotage tactic. If this attribute is not intentionally added, it will cause errors. No network activity or malicious payloads are present. The overall security risk is low but should be monitored, especially regarding the purpose of the suspicious attribute."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal version string assignment with obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is notable but not suspicious in this context. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, low security risk, and moderate obfuscation. No further action is necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated SQL query generator based on booster models, with no signs of malware or malicious payloads. The main security risk stems from potential SQL injection vulnerabilities due to string concatenation without input sanitization. It should be refactored to use parameterized queries and proper input validation to mitigate this risk."
