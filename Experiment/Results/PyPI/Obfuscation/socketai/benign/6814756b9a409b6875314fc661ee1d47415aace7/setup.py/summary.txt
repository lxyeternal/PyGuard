  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup with suspicious obfuscated assertions involving a non-standard 'setuptools' attribute. No malware or malicious activity is detected, but the obfuscation and invalid attribute access warrant further review. The main red flag is the assertion on 'setuptools.AdykEqPjOHLVVWyFdIkvxAxOLoaBVPYl', which is likely an obfuscation or sabotage tactic. If this attribute is not intentionally added, it will cause errors. No network activity or malicious payloads are present. The overall security risk is low but should be monitored, especially regarding the purpose of the suspicious attribute."
