  "purpose": "The code defines a version string for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "The only source is the assignment of the version string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data leaks or untrusted data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as there are no inputs or untrusted data manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears random or obfuscated, but it is simply an assignment statement. No other unusual behavior or hidden code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '0.0.1' to a variable named 'AdykEqPjOHLVVWyFdIkvxAxOLoaBVPYl'. The variable name seems randomly generated or obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal, with no external inputs, outputs, or operations. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code simply defines a version string, which is common in Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a simple version assignment. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
