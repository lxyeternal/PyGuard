  "purpose": "Build and set up a Python extension module, extracting necessary static libraries and version info, then clean up temporary files.",
  "sources": "os.getcwd(), os.path.exists(), open(), zipfile.ZipFile.extract(), shutil.copy(), open('version.txt'), setup() parameters",
  "sinks": "shutil.copy() (copying libraries and version files), os.remove() (deleting files), setup() (potentially executing build scripts)",
  "flows": "Checking for existing ZIP files -> extracting libraries -> copying files -> reading version -> configuring build extension -> cleaning up files",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, redundant string replace operation (replace('\n', '') without assignment), copying static libraries based on OS, no validation of extracted files, use of hardcoded filenames, and manipulation of version info from a file without validation",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages build artifacts for a Python extension module. It conditionally extracts static libraries from ZIP archives based on OS, copies files into a source directory, reads version info from a file, and then configures a C extension build. The obfuscated variable names suggest attempts to hide intent, but no direct malicious network or file operations are present. The code does not include any network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. It performs typical build steps with some minor obfuscation and redundant operations, but no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard build setup with obfuscated variable names and some redundant operations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. The code's purpose is to prepare build artifacts and configure a Python extension module securely.",
