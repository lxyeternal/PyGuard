  "purpose": "Build script for packaging a Python extension module, managing file extraction, copying, and setup configuration.",
  "sources": "Reads external ZIP files, version.txt, and static files from specific directories.",
  "sinks": "Copies files to build directories, reads version info, and sets up extension modules.",
  "flows": "Extracts ZIP contents -> copies static libraries -> reads version -> configures setup -> cleans up files.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, lack of validation for external files, no error handling, hardcoded paths.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard build operations such as extracting ZIP archives, copying static libraries, reading version info, and configuring a Python extension module. Variable names are obfuscated but do not exhibit malicious patterns. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The script lacks validation and error handling, which could be security concerns but do not indicate malicious intent. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical build setup with superficial obfuscation and no evidence of malicious behavior. The low malware score (0) and risk score (0.2) are appropriate. The obfuscation score (0.5) reflects moderate variable name obfuscation. Overall, the code is benign, but developers should consider adding validation and error handling to improve security.",
