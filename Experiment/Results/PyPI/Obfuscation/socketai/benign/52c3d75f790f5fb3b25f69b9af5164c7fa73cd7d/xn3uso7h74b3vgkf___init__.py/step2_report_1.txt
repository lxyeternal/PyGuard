  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, assessing the reasoning, and ensuring the scores align with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports focus on the same code snippet: three import statements using wildcard syntax from local modules.\n- No actual code execution, data flow, or external communication is present in the snippet.\n- The primary concern raised is the use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code if the modules are compromised.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1: Presence of Malicious Code or Behavior**\n\n**Confirmed?**  \n- The code snippet itself contains only import statements. No direct evidence of malicious code or activity is present in this fragment.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n- **No malicious activity detected** in this snippet alone.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- `malware`: 0 (consistent across reports)  \n- `securityRisk`: Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, which seems slightly high given the minimal code, but considering the risk of hidden malicious code inside modules, some caution is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2: Use of Wildcard Imports ('*')**\n\n**Reasoning:**  \n- All reports correctly identify that wildcard imports are discouraged because they obscure what is imported and can hide malicious or unwanted code.\n- The risk here hinges on whether the imported modules are trustworthy.\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Since the modules are local and presumably part of the same project, the risk is lower than importing from untrusted sources.  \n- However, if the modules are compromised, wildcard imports could hide malicious functions or classes.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- `obfuscated`: 0 (not obfuscated, just wildcard imports)  \n- `malware`: 0 (no evidence of malware)  \n- `securityRisk`: Slightly higher (0.2–0.3) due to import style concerns, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3: Content of Imported Modules**\n\n- The reports note that the actual security implications depend on the content of the modules, which are not provided.\n- This is a valid point; without inspecting the modules, we cannot definitively determine malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4: Reasonableness of Scores**\n\n- The `confidence` scores vary between 0.4 and 1.0, which is appropriate given the limited information.\n- The `malware` scores are consistently 0, aligning with the absence of evidence.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are slightly elevated (0.2–0.3), reflecting the potential concern with wildcard imports.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 unless evidence of malicious code is found inside the modules.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, as there's no obfuscation in the import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** Should stay low (around 0.2–0.3), acknowledging the import style concern but not overestimating risk without further module inspection.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Issue                        | Present? | Notes                                                                                   | Suggested Score Adjustments                                  |\n|------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malicious code/activity      | No         | No evidence in snippet; depends on imported modules                                | Keep at 0                                                   |\n| Use of wildcard imports      | Yes        | Identified as a security concern; acceptable if modules are trusted                 | Keep at ~0.2–0.3                                            |\n| Content of imported modules  | Unknown    | Cannot assess without module code                                                  | N/A                                                          |\n| Obfuscation                  | No         | Not obfuscated; just wildcard imports                                               | 0                                                          |\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0** — straightforward import statements.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — due to use of wildcard imports, which could hide malicious code if modules are compromised.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet itself is benign but employs a risky import pattern. The real security concern depends on the trustworthiness and content of the imported modules. No evidence suggests malicious behavior at this stage.",
