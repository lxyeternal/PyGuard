  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring consistency.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code only contains import statements from local modules.\n- The main concern across reports is the use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure what is imported and potentially hide malicious code.\n- No direct malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are visible in this code snippet alone.\n- The reports generally conclude that further inspection of the imported modules is necessary, which is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Specific report evaluations:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Correctly notes the minimal nature of the code, the use of wildcard imports, and the potential security concern.\n- **Scores:** \n  - malware: 0 — appropriate, no evidence of malware.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation evident.\n  - securityRisk: 0.25 — reasonable, given wildcard imports can hide malicious code.\n- **Justification:** The score seems reasonable. The confidence is 0.5, reflecting moderate uncertainty.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes the risks of wildcard imports.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.\n  - securityRisk: 0.3 — slightly higher, justified by the same concerns.\n- **Justification:** Slightly higher security risk score is justified due to the potential for hidden malicious code inside imported modules.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Slightly more cautious, noting the unusual module names but no direct evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation.\n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — reasonable, given no immediate threat.\n- **Justification:** The risk score is conservative and justified.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Very straightforward, no anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0 — aligns with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** Correct; minimal risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, highlights the use of wildcard imports as a risk factor.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0\n  - obfuscated: 0\n  - securityRisk: 0.2 — consistent with previous assessments.\n- **Justification:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is consistent with the evidence.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, no obfuscation detected.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0 to 0.3, which seems reasonable given the context.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent and justified based on the code snippet.\n- The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which is appropriately reflected in the security risk scores.\n- Since the actual imported modules are not provided, the assessment correctly emphasizes the need for further review.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2–0.3 — moderate, due to wildcard imports.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — consistent with the reports, considering the potential for malicious code hiding inside the modules.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate, and their scoring aligns well with the analysis. The primary concern remains the use of wildcard imports, which can obscure malicious code if present in the imported modules. Without inspecting those modules, the overall risk remains moderate but not high.\n\n**Final note:** Always review the contents of imported modules, especially when wildcard imports are used, to ensure no malicious or unintended code is present.",
