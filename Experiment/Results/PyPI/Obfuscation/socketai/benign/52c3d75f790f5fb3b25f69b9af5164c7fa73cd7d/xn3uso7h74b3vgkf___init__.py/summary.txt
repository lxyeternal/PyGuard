  "conclusion": "The code is benign in itself but employs a risky import pattern that could hide malicious code if modules are compromised. No evidence of malicious activity is present, but the use of wildcard imports warrants caution. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and further review of the imported modules is advised for comprehensive security assessment."
