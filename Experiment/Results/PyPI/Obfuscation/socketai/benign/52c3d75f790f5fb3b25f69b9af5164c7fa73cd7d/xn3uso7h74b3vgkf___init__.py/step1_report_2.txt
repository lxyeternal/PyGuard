  "flows": "No data flows are present in this snippet, as it only contains import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') from local modules, which can obscure the actual functions and classes imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code.",
  "analysis": "The code solely performs import operations from three local modules using wildcard imports. Wildcard imports are generally discouraged because they obscure the namespace and can make security analysis more difficult. Without access to the contents of these modules, it is impossible to definitively assess malicious behavior. There are no obvious security issues, such as hardcoded credentials or network calls, within this fragment itself. However, the use of wildcard imports warrants caution, as malicious code could be hidden inside the imported modules. The code structure is minimal, and no suspicious behavior is directly observable.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is limited to importing modules with wildcard statements, which can conceal malicious or unintended code inside those modules. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this fragment, but the use of wildcard imports reduces code transparency and could pose security risks if the imported modules are malicious. Further review of the modules' contents is recommended.",
