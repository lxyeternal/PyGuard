  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes, the code only performs import statements.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report correctly notes the use of wildcard imports ('*') as a security concern, but emphasizes that no malicious activity is evident in this fragment alone.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.25 seem reasonable given the minimal code.  \n- **Justification for risk score:** The use of wildcard imports can hide malicious code if the modules are compromised, so a small risk score is justified.  \n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0, as no malicious activity is visible.  \n- **Assumptions:** The report avoids unwarranted assumptions, just noting potential risks.  \n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes, same as above.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** Same as above; the report is thorough in noting the risks of wildcard imports.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3 — slightly higher, reflecting increased caution.  \n- **Justification for risk score:** The potential for malicious code inside imported modules justifies a slightly higher risk score, but without evidence, it remains low.  \n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.  \n- **Assumptions:** No unwarranted assumptions; cautious but not accusatory.  \n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes, only import statements.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** No, the analysis is appropriate.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — reasonable given the minimal code.  \n- **Justification for risk score:** Slightly lower risk, as no suspicious patterns are noted.  \n- **Malware score:** Correctly 0.  \n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes, only import statements.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** No, the analysis is sound.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.  \n- **Justification for risk score:** No apparent risks.  \n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Issues Confirmed?** Yes, the code only performs imports.  \n- **Errors/Flaws:** Correctly identifies the use of wildcard imports as a concern but finds no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 — consistent with cautious stance.  \n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. The code is purely import statements.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the straightforward import statements.  \n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting the concern over wildcard imports. This is reasonable, but perhaps slightly conservative given the minimal code.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The use of wildcard imports ('*') is a notable security concern because it can hide malicious code within the imported modules. While the snippets themselves are benign, the risk depends heavily on the contents of these modules, which are not provided.  \n- No evidence suggests the modules are malicious, but the pattern warrants caution.  \n- The risk scores could be slightly increased if the imported modules are from untrusted sources or if their contents are unknown, but based solely on this fragment, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward.  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — considering the wildcard import pattern, a small but non-zero risk is justified.  \n- **Overall security posture:** The code itself is benign but employs risky import practices that could hide malicious code if the modules are compromised.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe current scores are reasonable and consistent with the code provided. The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which should be replaced with explicit imports for better transparency and security. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to fully assess security.",
