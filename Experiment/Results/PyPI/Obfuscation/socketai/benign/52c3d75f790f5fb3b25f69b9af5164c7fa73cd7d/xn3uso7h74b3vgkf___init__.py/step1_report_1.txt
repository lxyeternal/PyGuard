  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from local modules 'ursinanetworking', 'easyursinanetworking', and 'replicated_2'",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules within the same package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication in this snippet",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow observed in this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') which can obscure what is being imported and may hide malicious or unwanted code behaviors",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements from three local modules. The use of wildcard imports ('*') is generally discouraged as it can import unintended or malicious code if the modules are compromised or malicious. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code in this snippet alone. Without inspecting the content of the imported modules, it is impossible to definitively assess malicious intent or malware. The snippet itself is minimal and does not perform any operations or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs simple local module imports with no explicit malicious activity visible. The use of wildcard imports is a potential security concern but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. Additional review of the imported modules is necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
