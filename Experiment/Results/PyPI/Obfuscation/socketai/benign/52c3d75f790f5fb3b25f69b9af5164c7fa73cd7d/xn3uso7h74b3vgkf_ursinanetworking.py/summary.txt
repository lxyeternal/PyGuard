  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical networking library with a critical security vulnerability due to unsafe pickle deserialization. No active malware or malicious behavior is detected, but the potential for exploitation is high if untrusted data is processed. The overall security risk score should be high, with malware score at zero, and obfuscation minimal."
