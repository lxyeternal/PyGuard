  "security_risk": 0.8,

  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits characteristics typical of malicious backdoors or C2 clients, including obfuscation, persistent network connection, and indefinite looping. While explicit payloads are not visible, the suspicious structure warrants a high malware score. The overall security risk is high, and further dynamic analysis is recommended."
