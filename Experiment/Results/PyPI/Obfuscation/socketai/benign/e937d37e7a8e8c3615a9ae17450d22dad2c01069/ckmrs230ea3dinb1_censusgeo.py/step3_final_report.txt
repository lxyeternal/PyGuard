  "purpose": "A class representing geographic or census data with methods for comparison, string representation, and generating API request parameters.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters providing geographic data; internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "The method 'ehfUqAdkwdzhLvwkFuYjpEPaKbtgzjqT' constructs dictionaries for API requests but does not perform network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into internal tuples, then into methods that generate request parameter dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and method names; malformed docstring in 'ehfUqAdkwdzhLvwkFuYjpEPaKbtgzjqT'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class for geographic information with comparison, hashing, and string methods. The method 'ehfUqAdkwdzhLvwkFuYjpEPaKbtgzjqT' creates request parameter dictionaries without network activity. Obfuscation is high, likely for concealment, but no malicious behavior, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. The class does not process untrusted data insecurely and contains no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads. The malformed docstring appears to be a formatting issue, not malicious. The overall structure suggests a utility for geographic data handling, with obfuscation being the main suspicious feature but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, if heavily obfuscated, utility class for geographic data management. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The obfuscation score is high due to naming, and the overall risk is low.",
