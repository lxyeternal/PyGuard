  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, if heavily obfuscated, utility class for geographic data management. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The obfuscation score is high due to naming, and the overall risk is low."
