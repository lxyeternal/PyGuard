  "purpose": "Module initialization importing multiple local submodules and a specific function, setting a version string.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules and a specific function/variable from one module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import statements and variable assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, which could be autogenerated or for internal use.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup module that imports several local modules and a specifically named function or variable with an obfuscated name. It assigns a version string to a variable. There are no network calls, data leaks, or code execution visible. The obfuscated names are suspicious but not necessarily malicious; they could be part of internal naming conventions or code obfuscation. The absence of active malicious behavior, data manipulation, or external communication indicates a benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscated identifiers that are not sufficient evidence of malicious activity. The security risk is negligible, and the obfuscation does not justify high threat scores. Monitoring should continue if further context reveals malicious behavior, but based solely on this snippet, the supply chain security posture is acceptable.",
