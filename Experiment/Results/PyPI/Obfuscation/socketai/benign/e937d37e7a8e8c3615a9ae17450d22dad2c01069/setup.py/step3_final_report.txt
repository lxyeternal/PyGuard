{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata and dependencies for a Python project using distutils, with heavily obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "The variable assignments and parameters within the setup() function, including package metadata, dependencies, classifiers, and package data paths.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no network or file operations; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "N/A – static configuration; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names and parameter keys, which is unusual for setup scripts and raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be benign or malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or code execution is present. The obfuscation is suspicious but not evidence of malicious intent. Scores across reports consistently indicate no malware (score 0), high obfuscation suspicion (~0.75), and low security risk (~0.2). The lack of malicious behavior suggests the code is safe, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, heavily obfuscated setup configuration with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score should remain at 0. The overall security risk is low. Further source verification is recommended before deployment.",
