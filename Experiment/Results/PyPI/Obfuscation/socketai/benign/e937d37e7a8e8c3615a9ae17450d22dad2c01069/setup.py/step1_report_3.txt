  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for distribution using distutils",
  "sources": "Code reads no external input, only defines static setup parameters",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code is static configuration",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated variable names such as yrUMmDocGtngZGLIjZDRaKyHHzmVXsAU and nboQRdeVZORINlLPKaxVtqqVpYezdGBL, which appear to be intentionally obscure, and unusual key names like PXKyaZxFiYFEQWQyvFdyNmWCwdPrapFX and UtKnUvyJUchEGxdMaWyNMqHNVjdOxhpU, potentially used to hide malicious intent or confuse code reviewers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using distutils, but includes suspiciously obfuscated variable names and keys, which is uncommon in legitimate package setup files. No dynamic code execution or input handling is present. The obfuscated variable names and unusual key names could be attempts to hide malicious logic or evade detection. However, no direct malicious behavior, such as network access, file manipulation, or data exfiltration, is evident from this snippet. The presence of obfuscation raises suspicion but lacks concrete malicious actions within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup with suspiciously obfuscated variable names and keys. These obfuscations could be benign or malicious, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet alone. Caution is advised if this code is part of a larger, unknown package.",
