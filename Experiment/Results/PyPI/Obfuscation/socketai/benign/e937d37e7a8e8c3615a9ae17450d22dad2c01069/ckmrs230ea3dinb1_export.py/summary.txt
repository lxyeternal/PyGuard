  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate data processing with obfuscation tactics. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation score reflects the code's complexity, but the overall security risk remains low. No modifications to the initial assessment are necessary."
