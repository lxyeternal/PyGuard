  "purpose": "Data processing and export, likely involving tabular or geospatial data, with validation and cleanup steps.",
  "sources": "Data extraction from nested structures, reading columns, and data validation assertions.",
  "sinks": "Writing the processed data to a CSV file; deletion of data keys after export.",
  "flows": "Source: data extraction and validation; sink: to_csv function; cleanup: deletion of data keys.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, complex list comprehensions, deletion of data after export, and reindexing operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated but performs typical data validation, manipulation, and export tasks. No network activity, credential handling, or system modifications are evident. Assertions are used for validation, and data keys are deleted post-export, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. The obfuscation and data deletion could be used to hide malicious intent, but no concrete malicious behavior or payloads are present. The malware score should remain at 0 given the lack of malicious indicators. The high obfuscation score (around 0.75) is justified due to variable naming and complex logic. The security risk score remains low (~0.2-0.3), as no malicious activity is detected, though obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate data processing with obfuscation tactics. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation score reflects the code's complexity, but the overall security risk remains low. No modifications to the initial assessment are necessary.",
