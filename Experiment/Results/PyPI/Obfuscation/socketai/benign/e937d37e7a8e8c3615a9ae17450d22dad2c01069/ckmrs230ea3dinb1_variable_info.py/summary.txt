  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, low-risk data processing utility with no evidence of malware or sabotage. Variable naming obfuscation is minimal and acceptable. The overall security posture is low, and the scores should reflect this, with malware at 0, obfuscation around 0.3, and risk around 0.2."
