  "flows": "Environment variable 'RELEASE_VERSION' -> Variable 'CHHZzyNhEGFETJjRgJORitHNOTPVUToK'; print statements do not affect data flow",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated variable name ('CHHZzyNhEGFETJjRgJORitHNOTPVUToK'), which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, no external data exfiltration, no dynamic code execution, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, checks for an environment variable, and assigns a value accordingly. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but it only stores release version info. The setup function is called with fixed version '1.0.0' and a dependency list. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No suspicious network activity or malicious side effects are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard setup operations with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent. It does not contain malware or security risks based on current analysis.",
