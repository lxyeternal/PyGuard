{
  "purpose": "The code configures package setup parameters, specifically setting a release version based on environment variables or current date.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'RELEASE_VERSION', current date via datetime.datetime.now()",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data that lead to data leaks or malicious effects; environment variable used only for versioning in setup",
  "flows": "Environment variable 'RELEASE_VERSION' flows into the variable 'CHHZzyNhEGFETJjRgJORitHNOTPVUToK', which is used solely for informational purposes in the script",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code simply reads environment variable and date, then uses setup function",
  "analysis": "The script checks for 'RELEASE_VERSION' in environment variables, assigns its value if present, or defaults to current date in UTC. The setup function is invoked with static version and dependency list. No untrusted data is used in dangerous contexts. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup script for a Python package. It safely reads environment variables and the current date for versioning purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
