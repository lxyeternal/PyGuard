  "purpose": "Set up package metadata with dynamic release version based on environment variable or current date.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'RELEASE_VERSION', datetime.datetime.now()",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leak or malicious activity",
  "flows": "Reads 'RELEASE_VERSION' from environment -> uses as release version; falls back to current date if not set",
  "anomalies": "Use of a long, obfuscated variable name 'CHHZzyNhEGFETJjRgJORitHNOTPVUToK', which may indicate intent to conceal or obfuscate purpose; no other suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code reads an environment variable 'RELEASE_VERSION' to determine the release version for setup. If the variable exists, it uses its value; otherwise, it defaults to the current UTC date. The variable name used to store the release version is intentionally long and obscure, but it does not execute code, access sensitive data, or connect to external systems. The setup function is called with static version '1.0.0' and a fixed dependency requirement. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a straightforward setup script with an unusual variable name but no malicious intent or security risks. It dynamically determines the release version without executing untrusted code or exposing sensitive information.",
