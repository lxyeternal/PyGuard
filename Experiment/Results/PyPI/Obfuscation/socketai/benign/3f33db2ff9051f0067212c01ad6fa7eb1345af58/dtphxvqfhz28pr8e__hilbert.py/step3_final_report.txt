{
  "purpose": "The code implements geohash encoding and decoding functions for spatial data, utilizing obfuscation and fallback mechanisms for performance optimization.",
  "sources": "Input floats for latitude and longitude, and internal functions for coordinate transformations and bitwise operations.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input coordinates are processed through obfuscated functions, bitwise manipulations, and fallback geohash computations, resulting in encoded strings or coordinate pairs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with complex bitwise logic, dynamic import fallback to Cython modules, and obfuscated variable/function names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs spatial encoding/decoding with obfuscation, fallback to optimized modules, and complex bitwise operations. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation appears to be for IP protection or code complexity, not malicious intent. The malware score is minimal, consistent with no malicious behavior. The security risk is low, primarily due to obfuscation hindering analysis but not indicating active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a legitimate, heavily obfuscated geospatial utility with no signs of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute a security threat based on current evidence.",
