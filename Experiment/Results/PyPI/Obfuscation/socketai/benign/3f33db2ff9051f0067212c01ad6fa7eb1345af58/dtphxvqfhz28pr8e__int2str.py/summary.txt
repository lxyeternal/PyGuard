  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for data encoding and decoding with significant obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is detected. The main concern is the potential misuse of obfuscation to hide malicious payloads, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is low, the obfuscation score is high, and the overall security risk is moderate due to the potential for misuse."
