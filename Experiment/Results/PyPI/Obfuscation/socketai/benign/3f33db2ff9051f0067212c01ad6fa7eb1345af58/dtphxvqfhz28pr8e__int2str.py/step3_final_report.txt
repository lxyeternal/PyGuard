  "purpose": "Encoding and decoding routines using various base schemes, heavily obfuscated variable names and custom encoding schemes.",
  "sources": "Input integers for encoding functions, input strings for decoding functions.",
  "sinks": "Generated encoded strings, decoded integers, and data transformations within functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through encoding/decoding functions, with bitwise operations and lookups, without external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via nonsensical variable names, custom base encodings, and complex encoding schemes that could be used to hide malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for encoding integers into custom base representations and decoding strings back into integers. Variable names are intentionally obscure, and multiple encoding schemes are implemented, including base64-like, hex, and custom bases. No network activity, system modifications, or explicit malicious actions are present. The heavy obfuscation could be exploited to conceal malicious payloads, but the functions themselves are standard encoding routines. The code's primary purpose appears benign, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for data encoding and decoding with significant obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is detected. The main concern is the potential misuse of obfuscation to hide malicious payloads, but the code itself is benign. The malware score is low, the obfuscation score is high, and the overall security risk is moderate due to the potential for misuse.",
