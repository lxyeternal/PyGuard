  "purpose": "Attempt to configure Cython extension for building a Python package, specifically compiling 'geohash_hilbert/_hilbert_cython.pyx'.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Cython.Build and the cythonize function; the filename 'geohash_hilbert/_hilbert_cython.pyx'.",
  "sinks": "The update of 'setup_kwargs' with Cython build options, which could influence package build behavior.",
  "flows": "Import and check for Cython; if available, add cythonize configuration to setup_kwargs for building Cython extensions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. The code dynamically configures a Cython extension if available, which is standard for extension modules.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an empty dictionary, then attempts to import 'cythonize' from Cython.Build. If successful, it adds a configuration to compile a specific .pyx file as a C extension. If Cython is not available, it silently proceeds without error. The function 'oMNgqholwDZRrFJWzsTGznkEmRAEZkvl' updates provided 'setup_kwargs' with the Cython configuration, which is typical for setup scripts.\n\nNo suspicious or malicious code, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The code merely sets up a build configuration.\n\nThe obfuscation level appears low; variable names are nonsensical but not intentionally obfuscated code. The code follows a standard pattern for optional Cython extension compilation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup configuration snippet for optional Cython compilation of a Python extension module. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior and is likely part of a larger setup script. No malware or malicious intent detected.",
