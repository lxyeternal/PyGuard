  "purpose": "The code attempts to conditionally compile a Cython extension module for the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement for Cython.Build.cythonize, reading the filename 'geohash_hilbert/_hilbert_cython.pyx'",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; the code only modifies setup arguments",
  "flows": "The import flow to the cythonize function, and the update of setup_kwargs with compiled extension modules",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and conditional compilation; no direct anomalies but unusual for minimal code",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dictionary, attempts to import Cython.Build.cythonize, and if successful, prepares a list of extension modules for compilation. If Cython is not available, it silently skips. The function updates provided setup_kwargs with extension modules, facilitating optional Cython compilation during setup. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity is evident. The code is straightforward and typical for Cython extensions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup utility snippet to include Cython modules if available. No malicious intent or security issues are present. The code appears safe and typical for package setup scripts.",
