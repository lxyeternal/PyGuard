{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to conditionally import Cython build tools to compile a Cython extension module for 'geohash_hilbert/_hilbert_cython.pyx' and update provided setup parameters.",
  "sources": "The import statement from Cython.Build and the '_hilbert_cython.pyx' file path.",
  "sinks": "The setup_kwargs dictionary being updated with the compiled extension modules.",
  "flows": "Import attempt -> if successful, updates setup_kwargs with cythonize output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; conditional import and setup update are standard practices.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes an empty dictionary, attempts to import cythonize from Cython.Build, and if successful, sets up a dictionary with compiled extension modules. If Cython is not installed, it silently skips the extension setup. The function 'oMNgqholwDZRrFJWzsTGznkEmRAEZkvl' updates the passed-in setup_kwargs with this extension configuration. There are no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious actions detected. The code's purpose appears to be standard build setup for a Python extension module using Cython.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign conditional setup for compiling a Cython extension. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks present.",
