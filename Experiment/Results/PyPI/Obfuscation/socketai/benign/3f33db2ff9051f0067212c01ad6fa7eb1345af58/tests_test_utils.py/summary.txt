  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of tests for geospatial encoding functions, with obfuscated naming but no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. The code appears safe for use in its intended testing context."
