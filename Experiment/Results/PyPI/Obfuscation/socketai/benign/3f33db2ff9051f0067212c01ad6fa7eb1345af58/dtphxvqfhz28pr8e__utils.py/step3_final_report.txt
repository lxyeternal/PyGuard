  "purpose": "Geographic feature generation, coordinate calculations, and spatial data encoding based on directional input.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 'ExSCVtpaNLaAfBIPLgYzQsjucBtnHyIw'; internal functions 'rqFXLzCkIOBITUoALPMdvEOPhwQdYqLm' and 'NuDsqdtjkuPXUfzdeIEaGnfQqBruLtpI' providing coordinate data.",
  "sinks": "Encoded spatial features, GeoJSON-like feature dictionaries, and coordinate arrays; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input string -> coordinate extraction functions -> coordinate calculations -> encoding functions -> output dictionaries or feature objects.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names; reliance on internal modules with unknown implementations; no explicit malicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs spatial coordinate calculations, neighbor direction mapping, and feature generation for geographic data. Obfuscated naming suggests concealment but does not imply malicious intent. No network, file, or environment manipulation is present. The functions used are likely for coordinate encoding and spatial feature creation. Given the absence of suspicious network activity, data leaks, or malicious code, the code appears legitimate for geographic processing. The obfuscation level varies but is justified by the naming conventions. The imported functions' unknown implementations warrant caution but do not currently indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a spatial data processing module with obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (around 0.2) are appropriate. The moderate obfuscation (around 0.4) warrants cautious review of internal functions but does not currently suggest malicious intent.",
