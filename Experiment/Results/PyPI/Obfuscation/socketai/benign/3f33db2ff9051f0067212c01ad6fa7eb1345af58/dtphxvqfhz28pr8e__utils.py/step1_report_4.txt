  "purpose": "The code appears to generate geographic feature data and neighboring direction data, likely for spatial analysis or mapping purposes.",
  "sources": "Functions rqFXLzCkIOBITUoALPMdvEOPhwQdYqLm and NuDsqdtjkuPXUfzdeIEaGnfQqBruLtpI, and input parameter ExSCVtpaNLaAfBIPLgYzQsjucBtnHyIw.",
  "sinks": "Encoded geographic and spatial data, returned as dictionaries; no direct data leakage or system impact observed.",
  "flows": "Input string ExSCVtpaNLaAfBIPLgYzQsjucBtnHyIw flows into rqFXLzCkIOBITUoALPMdvEOPhwQdYqLm and NuDsqdtjkuPXUfzdeIEaGnfQqBruLtpI, which produce coordinate data used in encoding functions, ultimately forming geographic feature dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "Use of encode functions with coordinate calculations involving trigonometric adjustments; no hardcoded secrets or backdoors; code appears consistent with spatial data processing. No obfuscated code or suspicious control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions for spatial data processing, including calculation of neighboring directions and feature geometries, using trigonometric adjustments. The data encoding functions are called with coordinate adjustments, but no malicious behavior, system access, or data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. The input parameters and data flow suggest legitimate geographic processing without harmful intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate spatial data processing code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It generates geographic feature data and neighbor directions based on input strings, using encoding functions and coordinate calculations. No malicious patterns, backdoors, or data leaks are detected.",
