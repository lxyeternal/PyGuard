{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of pytest-based test functions verifying two functions from the geohash_hilbert._int2str module, focusing on input validation, correctness, and error handling.",
  "sources": "Fixed values, ranges, and random integers used as inputs to the functions.",
  "sinks": "Function calls with assertions; no external data exfiltration or network activity.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions, with outputs checked for correctness and reversibility.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or non-descriptive function names; no secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard testing routines for encoding/decoding functions, with validation of error handling for invalid inputs. No suspicious patterns, no external data leaks, and no malicious behavior are evident. Obfuscated names are noted but do not imply malicious intent. The code is benign and primarily for correctness verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test suite for encoding/decoding routines, with obfuscated identifiers but no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
