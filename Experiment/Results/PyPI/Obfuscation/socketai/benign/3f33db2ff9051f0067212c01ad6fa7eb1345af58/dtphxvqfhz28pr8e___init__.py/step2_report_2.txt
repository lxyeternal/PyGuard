  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code snippet:**\n- Performs relative imports from internal modules `_hilbert` and `_utils`.\n- Imports functions and variables with obfuscated or auto-generated names.\n- Defines an `__all__` list exposing specific functions for public API.\n- Contains no function calls, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors.\n- Obfuscated naming could be intentional for hiding implementation details or simply a coding style.\n\n---\n\n### **Review of each report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import specific functions/variables; no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Recognizes obfuscated names but finds no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely benign; obfuscation not inherently malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.7, obfuscated=0.6\n\n**Assessment:** This is reasonable. The code is simple, and obfuscation alone isn't enough to imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on obfuscated function names.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated names could be hiding purpose, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscation might be benign; no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7, obfuscated=0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher obfuscation score, which is appropriate given the names. Malware score remains zero, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Re-export functions; no suspicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated names but no malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely benign; obfuscation is a style choice.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.7\n\n**Assessment:** The high confidence and zero malware score are consistent. Obfuscation is noted but not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import/export pattern; obfuscated names.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; obfuscation raises suspicion but no evidence.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.6, obfuscated=0.7\n\n**Assessment:** Reasonable. The low malware score aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern; no suspicious behavior.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated names; no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0.7\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is consistent with the code snippet. The code only involves imports and exports with obfuscated names; no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated names:** The obfuscation level varies but is generally high. Obfuscation alone isn't malicious but warrants caution.\n- **Risk scores:** Low overall, reflecting the absence of malicious activity or security issues.\n\n---\n\n### **My expert estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 — obfuscated names are prominent and could be benign or for concealment.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — minimal security risk, primarily due to obfuscation.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a typical module setup with obfuscated internal identifiers. Without additional context or code execution, there’s no indication of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation could be a deliberate design choice or a simple obfuscation tactic.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are consistent with my assessment. The code is benign, with obfuscation being the only notable aspect, but not enough to raise security concerns.",
