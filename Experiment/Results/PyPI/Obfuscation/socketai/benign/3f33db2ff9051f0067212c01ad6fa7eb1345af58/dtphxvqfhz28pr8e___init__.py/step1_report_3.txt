  "purpose": "Import specific functions and variables from internal modules for encoding, decoding, and utility operations, and define publicly accessible symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing functions and variables from internal modules (_hilbert and _utils).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted input or data; no output or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks; only static imports and module attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers have obfuscated names (e.g., qWgWkFnupTBUvNHdIXvmJPacpbOCZYyN), which may suggest obfuscation, but they could also be auto-generated or intentionally named. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements from internal modules with non-descriptive, obfuscated-looking function and variable names, followed by the definition of __all__ listing functions for encoding, decoding, and geometric operations. There is no execution of untrusted data, no network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no apparent malicious logic. The obfuscated naming could be a coding style or intentional obfuscation but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The overall structure appears typical for a module that re-exports functions for public use.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily imports functions and variables with obfuscated names and declares an API surface via __all__. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities. The obfuscated identifiers are likely just naming choices or auto-generated. Overall, this code appears benign.",
