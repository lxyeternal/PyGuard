  "purpose": "Module setup with import/export definitions and obfuscated internal identifiers.",
  "sources": "Internal modules '_hilbert' and '_utils' with obfuscated function/variable names.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or auto-generated names for imported identifiers; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs minimal import statements from internal modules with obfuscated names, then defines an __all__ list for public API exposure. No data processing, network activity, or malicious logic is present. Obfuscation may be a stylistic or auto-generation choice rather than malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the obfuscation but find no evidence of malicious behavior. Malware scores are consistently zero, and risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module with obfuscated internal identifiers, likely part of a larger library. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities in this fragment. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but warrants cautious review of the actual function implementations in the imported modules. Overall, the security risk is minimal.",
