{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that provides functions related to Hilbert curves and utility functions, likely for spatial or mathematical computations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules ._hilbert and ._utils, which provide functions with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible here since the code only shows import statements and a list definition without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function names (qWgWkFnupTBUvNHdIXvmJPacpbOCZYyN, rqFXLzCkIOBITUoALPMdvEOPhwQdYqLm, mmpfRfXUbCrnMVbQzHKbdqEMZXoRxeaJ, LTWxRDweuoftZvAfRTybaMUUignpFXcv) which is unusual and could indicate attempts to hide functionality. No other suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions with deliberately obscure names, which can be a red flag for obfuscation or malicious intent. However, without the implementation details of these functions, it's impossible to determine their behavior. The module exports a set of functions related to decoding, encoding, and spatial computations, which are typical for a mathematical or spatial library. There are no visible signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system compromise. The obfuscation of function names warrants caution but does not definitively indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is part of a spatial or mathematical library with obfuscated internal functions. The obfuscation raises some suspicion but, based solely on this fragment, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The lack of network or system interaction suggests low likelihood of malware, but caution is advised due to the obfuscated names.",
