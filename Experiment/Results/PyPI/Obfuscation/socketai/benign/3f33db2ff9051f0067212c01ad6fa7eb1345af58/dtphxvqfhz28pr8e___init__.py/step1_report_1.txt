  "purpose": "Import specific functions and variables from internal modules for use in the package's public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's internal functions and variables from relative imports '_hilbert' and '_utils'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; the code only performs static imports and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows or external interactions occur in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers appear to be obfuscated or auto-generated, which may be suspicious. However, this is not definitive of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code performs relative imports from internal modules, importing multiple functions and variables with obfuscated or non-descriptive names. It then defines an __all__ list exposing specific functions for public use. The absence of function calls, data processing, network activity, or other behaviors suggests this is a typical module setup. The unusual naming could be a red flag for obfuscation or code generation, but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code does not contain any embedded code execution, data leaks, or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet appears to be a standard module import and export setup with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or malware within this limited code segment. The obfuscation alone is not enough to determine malicious intent, and no malicious activity is evident.",
