  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the reasoning provided.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code performs relative imports from internal modules `_hilbert` and `_utils`.\n- It imports functions and variables with obfuscated or auto-generated names.\n- It defines an `__all__` list to expose specific functions for public API.\n- There are no data flows, network interactions, or suspicious code constructs visible in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import specific functions/variables, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** Names look suspicious but could be auto-generated.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. Obfuscated names alone do not imply malicious intent, especially if the code is part of a library. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import and export setup, obfuscated names.\n- **Obfuscation:** Higher obfuscation score (0.8).\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, but obfuscation warrants caution.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. The code appears benign; obfuscation is common in some libraries but warrants review of actual functions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern—importing functions, defining `__all__`.\n- **Obfuscation:** Slightly lower obfuscation score (0.7).\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is standard for a module that re-exports functions, with obfuscated names but no malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Similar, related to spatial/mathematical computations.\n- **Obfuscation:** Obfuscation score 0.7.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, but obfuscation should be reviewed in actual function implementations.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity detected here.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Module for encoding/decoding, no suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** Obfuscation score 0.7.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. The code appears benign.\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- All reports agree that the code is primarily import/export setup with obfuscated names.\n- No evidence of network activity, data leaks, or malicious code.\n- Obfuscation alone does not imply malware; it may be a stylistic choice or auto-generated code.\n- The malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the analysis.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The obfuscated function names should be reviewed in their respective modules to ensure they do not contain malicious code.\n- Since the code is only import/export, the risk is minimal unless the imported functions are malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0.7 (moderate obfuscation, warrants caution)  \n**Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, given the limited code and no suspicious behavior)\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe current scores are reasonable given the limited scope. The main concern is obfuscation, which could hide malicious code in the imported functions, but there's no direct evidence here.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThis code snippet appears to be a standard module setup with obfuscated internal functions, likely part of a larger library. No malicious activity is evident from this fragment, but caution should be exercised by reviewing the actual implementations of the imported functions.",
