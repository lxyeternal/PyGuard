{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports functions from internal (possibly private) modules related to 'hilbert' and 'utils', and defines an __all__ list for public API exposure, likely part of a larger library dealing with geometric or mathematical computations.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules ._hilbert and ._utils, which provide functions used within this module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writes, or untrusted data handling are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flow is limited to importing functions and defining public exports; no data processing or untrusted data flows are evident here.",
  "anomalies": "The imported functions have obfuscated or nonsensical names (e.g., qWgWkFnupTBUvNHdIXvmJPacpbOCZYyN), which could be an attempt at obfuscation, hiding purpose or functionality. The code structure itself is minimal but the naming is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific functions from internal modules with intentionally obscure names, possibly to hide their true purpose. The __all__ list defines publicly accessible functions, indicating this module is part of a library interface. There are no evident data inputs, network calls, or malicious code constructs in this snippet. The obfuscated function names could be benign, or they could be hiding malicious behavior, but without additional code, this cannot be confirmed. The overall structure is simple and does not reveal malicious intent on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with obfuscated internal function names, which could be benign or a simple obfuscation tactic. There are no explicit malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks visible in this snippet. However, the obfuscated function names warrant cautious review of the actual functions in the modules for malicious code, which is outside the scope of this snippet.",
