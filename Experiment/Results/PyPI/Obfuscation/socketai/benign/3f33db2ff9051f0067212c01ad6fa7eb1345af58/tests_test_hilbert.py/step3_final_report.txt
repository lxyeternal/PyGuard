  "malware": 0,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for geohash and Hilbert curve encoding/decoding functions, utilizing random coordinate generation and parameterized tests to verify correctness and performance.",
  "sources": "Functions generating random coordinates, input parameters for encoding/decoding functions, and test data within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "Internal function calls, assertions, and benchmarking routines; no external data sinks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Random coordinate generators feed into encoding functions; encoded data is decoded back, with assertions verifying data integrity; benchmarking measures performance of encode/decode functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function and variable names (e.g., zHmjkLHEbDFZlEHyvvhALmJyGyUtImCa), which could be intended to conceal internal logic but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive set of tests for geospatial encoding functions, primarily involving random data generation, assertions, and performance benchmarking. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The obfuscation in naming is noted but appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. The use of randomness and internal assertions indicates a benign testing environment. Scores are assigned accordingly, with malware at 0, obfuscation at 0.7 due to naming, and low security risk. The overall assessment confirms the code's safety and benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign test suite for geospatial encoding functions with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain threats. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe for use.",
  "model": "gpt-4.1-nano"
