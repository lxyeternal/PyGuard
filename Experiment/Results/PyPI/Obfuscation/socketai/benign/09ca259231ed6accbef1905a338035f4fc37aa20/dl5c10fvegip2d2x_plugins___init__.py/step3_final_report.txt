  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security and malicious behavior in Python dependencies based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, environment variables, file reads, network operations, dynamic execution (eval), and code structure.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communication, file modifications, environment variable access, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data to sinks like network transmission, file writing, or eval execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval without context, missing code, lack of comments, or incomplete code descriptions; no signs of obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or benign nature of code, with appropriate confidence levels. The use of eval is noted as a potential concern but not confirmed malicious. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the descriptions. Risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting cautious consideration of dynamic features but no concrete evidence of malicious intent. Minor adjustments could lower risk scores slightly for reports with no code or benign descriptions, but current scores are reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and appropriately score the supply chain security risk, malware likelihood, and obfuscation status based on the provided descriptions. No significant malicious activity or obfuscation is evident. Slightly lowering risk scores in some reports could improve accuracy, but overall, the assessments are sound.",
