  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are detectable due to the absence of code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns are present; the code appears empty or non-existent.",
  "analysis": "The review reveals that the code content is absent; therefore, no operations, data processing, or security-sensitive activities are observable. Without code, it is impossible to identify any malicious behavior, code injection, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of any code or operations, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears to be empty or missing. Confidence is high that there are no security concerns in the provided input.",
