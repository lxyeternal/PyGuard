  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate EPUB processing library with obfuscation that does not currently indicate malicious intent. Static analysis shows no evidence of malware or sabotage. The obfuscation is likely for code complexity or minification, not malicious purposes. The supply chain risk is low, but ongoing monitoring is recommended if obfuscation levels increase or new behaviors emerge."
