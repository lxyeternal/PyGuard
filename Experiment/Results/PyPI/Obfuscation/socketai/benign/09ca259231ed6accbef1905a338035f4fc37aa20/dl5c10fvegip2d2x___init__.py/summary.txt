  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static, obfuscated resource mapping with no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to conceal purpose but does not constitute malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware is effectively zero, obfuscation is high but justified, and security risk is minimal. The code is safe to use in its current form."
