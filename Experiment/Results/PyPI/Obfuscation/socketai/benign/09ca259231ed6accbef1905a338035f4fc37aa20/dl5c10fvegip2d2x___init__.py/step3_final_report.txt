  "purpose": "Static configuration mapping file extensions to obfuscated variable identifiers, likely for resource validation or filtering.",
  "sources": "Assignment of constants and a dictionary mapping obfuscated variables to file extension lists.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present.",
  "flows": "Static data assignments; no dynamic data flow or execution paths.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; no active code or malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, consisting solely of variable assignments and a dictionary mapping obfuscated variable names to lists of file extensions. No functions, input handling, network activity, or code execution are present. The obfuscation of variable names suggests an attempt to conceal purpose but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The data appears to serve as resource categorization or validation, which is benign. The absence of active logic, data flows, or external interactions indicates no malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming but does not imply malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately low (0 to 0.2), reflecting no active threats. Security risk scores are also low, consistent with static benign data. Overall, the code is benign static configuration with superficial obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static, obfuscated resource mapping with no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended to conceal purpose but does not constitute malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware is effectively zero, obfuscation is high but justified, and security risk is minimal. The code is safe to use in its current form.",
