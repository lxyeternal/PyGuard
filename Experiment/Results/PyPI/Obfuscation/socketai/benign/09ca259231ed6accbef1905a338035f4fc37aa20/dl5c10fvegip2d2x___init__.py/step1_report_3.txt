{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define mappings and constants, likely used for file type handling or validation in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded string variables and a dictionary mapping extensions to file types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present; the code does not perform any I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "There is no dynamic data flow from external inputs to sinks; the mappings are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and do not follow standard naming conventions, which could be an attempt to hide intent. No actual malicious activity such as network access, system modification, or data exfiltration is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several variables with obfuscated names assigned to integers, possibly as constants. A dictionary maps variable values to lists of file extensions, seemingly for media, font, web, and other file types. The obfuscated naming pattern could be suspicious but may also be a coding style or part of a larger obfuscation strategy. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, network communication, or backdoors. The structure indicates static data setup, typical in configuration files or resource management modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or malicious behavior based on its static, configuration-like structure. The obfuscated variable names raise some suspicion, but there are no active malicious indicators such as network activity, credential handling, or destructive actions. The risk is low, with no evident security threat.",
