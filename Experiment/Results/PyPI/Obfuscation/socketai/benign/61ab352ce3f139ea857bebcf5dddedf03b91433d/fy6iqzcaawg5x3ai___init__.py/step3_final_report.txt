{
  "purpose": "Wrapper functions and classes for CUDA-accelerated sequence comparison metrics such as edit distance, WER, and CER, primarily used for evaluation purposes.",
  "sources": "Function arguments including sequences, lengths, hypotheses, references, and package version info via get_distribution.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network connections, or file modifications detected; data flows into core CUDA extension functions.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into core functions for computation; no external or untrusted data flows outside the module.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no suspicious code patterns, network activity, or malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of wrapper functions and classes around a CUDA extension for sequence metrics, with obfuscated identifiers. It performs internal computations without external communication or system modifications. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system access are present. The obfuscation appears to be a deliberate naming choice, not indicative of malicious intent. The package version retrieval is standard. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with legitimate evaluation utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated implementation of sequence comparison metrics with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation alone does not constitute a security threat, and the absence of external or system-impacting operations supports this assessment.",
