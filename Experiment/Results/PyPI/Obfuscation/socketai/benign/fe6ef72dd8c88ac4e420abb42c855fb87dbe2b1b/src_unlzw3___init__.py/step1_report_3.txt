{
  "purpose": "Importing a class or function named 'DsZAmyzyoWrZdIYfguVyGAXxegXCdDQP' from a local module '.unlzw' and exposing 'unlzw' as an API.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from '.unlzw' module, assigning version string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; import and variable assignment are static operations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable and class names, which appear to be obfuscated or auto-generated. No visible code logic beyond import and export statements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of a potentially obfuscated class/function and sets a version string. No external data input, no data processing, and no suspicious network or system actions are present. The class/function name 'DsZAmyzyoWrZdIYfguVyGAXxegXCdDQP' and variable name 'GvHYmWJVDTZBakVcpkvRqTSnDsChbyzC' are non-descriptive, which could suggest obfuscation, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The code does not contain any harmful operations, code injection, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to be a simple module import and version assignment with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet.",
