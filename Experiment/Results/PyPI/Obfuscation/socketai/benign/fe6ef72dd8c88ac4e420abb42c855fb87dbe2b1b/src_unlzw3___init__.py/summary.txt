  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and obfuscated, with no direct malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation suggests caution, but the lack of evidence of malicious behavior means the overall security risk remains low. Further inspection of the 'unlzw' module is recommended before deployment or trust in this package."
