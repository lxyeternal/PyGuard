  "purpose": "Import a class/function from a local module 'unlzw', define __all__ for export, and set a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.unlzw' module, version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import from local module; no data flow to external sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class/function name 'DsZAmyzyoWrZdIYfguVyGAXxegXCdDQP', obfuscated variable name 'GvHYmWJVDTZBakVcpkvRqTSnDsChbyzC', minimal code structure, lack of comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, syntactically correct, and imports an obscure class/function from a local module. The obfuscated identifiers suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but no malicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone. The version string is straightforward. The absence of active operations or data handling indicates low immediate risk, but the obfuscation warrants caution. The imported module's content could contain malicious code, but this cannot be determined here. The scores across reports are consistent: low malware likelihood (0-0.2), high obfuscation (around 0.7-0.8), and low security risk (around 0.1-0.3). Overall, the code appears benign but warrants further review of the 'unlzw' module to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and obfuscated, with no direct malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation suggests caution, but the lack of evidence of malicious behavior means the overall security risk remains low. Further inspection of the 'unlzw' module is recommended before deployment or trust in this package.",
