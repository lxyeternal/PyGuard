  "purpose": "Import a class from a local module and define an export list and version string",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module 'unlzw'",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No complex data flows; simply imports and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and class name; no actual functionality or processing shown",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated class 'DsZAmyzyoWrZdIYfguVyGAXxegXCdDQP' from a local module '.unlzw'. It then sets __all__ to expose 'unlzw', and assigns a version string to a variable with a similarly obfuscated name. The variable and class names appear intentionally obscure, which may indicate attempts at hiding purpose or obfuscation. The code is minimal and does not perform any operations, data processing, or network activity. There are no hardcoded credentials, no data leaks, and no malicious operations visible. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple import and export setup with obfuscated naming, without any apparent malicious intent or security issues. The obfuscation may warrant further review if part of a larger, more complex package, but this fragment alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior.",
