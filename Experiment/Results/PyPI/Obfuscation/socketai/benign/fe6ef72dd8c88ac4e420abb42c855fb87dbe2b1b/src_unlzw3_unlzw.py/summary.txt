  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a complex, obfuscated data decoder/decompressor with no direct signs of malicious activity. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence to classify it as malware. The current security scores are appropriate; I recommend maintaining a low malware score (~0.2), high obfuscation (~0.8), and a moderate risk (~0.3) due to the obfuscation but lack of malicious indicators."
