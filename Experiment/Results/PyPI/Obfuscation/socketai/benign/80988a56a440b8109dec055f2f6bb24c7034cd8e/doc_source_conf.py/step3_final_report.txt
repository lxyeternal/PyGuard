  "purpose": "Static configuration script for Sphinx documentation with obfuscated variable names, no malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments, list and string initializations, sys.path modification",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, superficial obfuscation without malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration with no dynamic or external interactions. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious activity. No data leaks, network activity, or code injection patterns are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for stylistic or concealment reasons, not malicious purposes. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration script for documentation purposes. No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation is superficial and not indicative of malicious intent. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
