      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated, non-standard method call in setuptools, which is highly suspicious and could be malicious. While no direct malicious actions are evident, the obfuscation and API mismatch justify a high security risk. Further source verification and dynamic analysis are recommended before deployment."
