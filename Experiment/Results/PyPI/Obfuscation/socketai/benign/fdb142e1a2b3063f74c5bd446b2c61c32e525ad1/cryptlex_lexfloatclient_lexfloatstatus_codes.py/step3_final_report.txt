{
  "purpose": "A static class containing numerous obfuscated integer constants, likely serving as an enumeration or configuration holder.",
  "sources": "Class variable assignments, no external input or data flow present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static constants only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, no functions or dynamic behavior, but no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static class with obfuscated variable names assigned to integer constants. There are no functions, data flows, or external interactions. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly auto-generated or for code organization, but does not imply malicious intent. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The malware score should be 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7-0.8) due to variable naming, which is typical of obfuscated or auto-generated code. The security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The class is a benign, obfuscated collection of constants with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation does not indicate malicious activity, and the code poses minimal security risk.",
