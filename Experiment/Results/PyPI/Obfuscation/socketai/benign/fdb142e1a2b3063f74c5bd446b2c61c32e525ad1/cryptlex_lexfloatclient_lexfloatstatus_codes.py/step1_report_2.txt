{
  "purpose": "Defines a class with a large number of class-level integer variables, potentially for data storage or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Class definition and class variables, no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are only assigned static integer values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. The code appears to be obfuscated or auto-generated, but lacks behavior indicating malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class with multiple integer attributes assigned static values. No methods, no external data inputs, no dynamic code execution, no cryptic or misleading constructs. It appears to be either a data container or obfuscated code, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Lack of operations, no environment variable use, and no secret handling suggests minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward class definition with static data attributes, likely obfuscated or auto-generated. There are no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities in the provided fragment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
