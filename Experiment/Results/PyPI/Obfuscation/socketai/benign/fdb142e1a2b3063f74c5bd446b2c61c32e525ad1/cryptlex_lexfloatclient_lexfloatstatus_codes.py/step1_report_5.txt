{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class with a series of class variables initialized to integer values, possibly serving as constants or configuration parameters.",
  "sources": "Class definition as source, specifically the assignment of class variables to integer constants.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data handling points are visible within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident; the code only contains static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious behaviors are apparent. Variable names are obfuscated but that alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class declaration with multiple class variables assigned sequential integer values. No input handling, no dynamic execution, no network operations, and no potential data leakage points are present. Variable names appear obfuscated but that does not inherently imply malicious intent. The code seems to serve as a container for constants, with no suspicious or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a simple class used for storing constants. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
