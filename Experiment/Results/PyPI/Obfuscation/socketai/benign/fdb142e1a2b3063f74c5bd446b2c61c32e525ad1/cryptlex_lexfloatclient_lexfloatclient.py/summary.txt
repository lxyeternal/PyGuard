  "conclusion": "The code functions as a license management interface with obfuscation, performing integrity checks via native SDK calls. There are no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but is likely for intellectual property protection rather than malicious concealment. Overall, the code appears legitimate within its context."
