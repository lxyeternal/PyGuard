{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom exception class for handling error codes related to a cryptographic licensing client, providing human-readable error messages for various error codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the 'code' parameter passed to the ZhGGFtzrICemQKVtvjtHOsKAFUkCkuRS method, which determines the error message.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs error messages based on the input code; no direct untrusted data sinks such as network or file I/O are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input 'code' is evaluated through a series of if-statements; based on its value, a specific error message string is returned.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be a tactic to hide functionality. The code relies on a dynamic import from a third-party module, but does not use external or malicious API calls. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are evident beyond standard error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements an error handling mechanism with a mapping from error codes to messages. It does not perform any network operations, file manipulations, or data exfiltration. The obfuscated names may suggest an attempt to hide its purpose, but the functionality appears to be straightforward error message mapping. No malicious behavior such as data leaks, backdoors, or harmful commands are present in this code fragment. The only potential concern is obfuscation, which may be for concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of an exception class with error message mapping, with obfuscated identifiers. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks in this context. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious activity. Overall, it appears benign.",
