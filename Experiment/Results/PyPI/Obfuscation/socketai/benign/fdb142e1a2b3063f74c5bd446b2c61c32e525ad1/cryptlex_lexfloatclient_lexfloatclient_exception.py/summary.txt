  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated error handling utility used in licensing or system error contexts. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage based on this fragment. The heavy obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
