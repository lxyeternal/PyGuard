  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python script with no explicit malicious intent, primarily performing data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, files, or user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to files, logs, or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or suspicious activity. The absence of dynamic execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets suggests a benign purpose. The scores reflect this, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2. Confidence is high (0.9) due to the lack of suspicious features. Overall, the code appears safe, with no indicators of malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided summaries, the code is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
