{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for concealment or proprietary reasons.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with obfuscated names, no input/output or data processing.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flows or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No operational code; no source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class names, no methods or logic, solely exception class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only obfuscated exception class definitions with no functional logic, data flows, or external interactions. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores assigned in reports reflect high obfuscation (0.8-0.9), low malware likelihood (0-0.1), and low security risk (0.2). These are consistent with the code's benign nature in isolation. No evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities is present. Further context would be needed to determine if these classes are used maliciously elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no immediate malicious activity. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent on its own. Scores are appropriate; no adjustments necessary. Further review in the broader codebase is recommended.",
