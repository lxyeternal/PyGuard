  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "Code defines class declarations without reading external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or processing occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are not instantiated or used.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming of classes; all class names are obfuscated, which could be intended to hide purpose or malicious intent. No other code logic or comments are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception, with obfuscated class names. There are no functions, no data handling, and no apparent malicious logic. The obfuscation could be a method to hide malicious intent, but given the simplicity, it may also be benign. However, the lack of context and the obfuscated names suggest a potential attempt to conceal the purpose of these exceptions, which warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to define obfuscated custom exception classes with no other logic or data handling. While this alone does not indicate malicious behavior, the obfuscation raises suspicion. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the pattern is consistent with attempts to conceal functionality.",
