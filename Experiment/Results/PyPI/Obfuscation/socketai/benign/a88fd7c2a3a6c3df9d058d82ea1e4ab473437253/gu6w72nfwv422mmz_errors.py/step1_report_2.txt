  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated names for potential use in larger codebase",
  "sources": "Class definitions that do not read external input or data",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names that do not indicate clear purpose; no functional code or logic present",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with unintelligible, obfuscated names. There is no logic, data input, or output. The classes are empty and do not perform any actions. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply an obfuscation technique. However, without any functional code, malicious payload, or data handling, this appears to be benign boilerplate or intentionally obscured code with no evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of empty, obfuscated class definitions for exceptions, with no input/output, data flows, or malicious indicators. It likely serves as a placeholder or intentionally obscured structure. No malicious activity or security risks are apparent based solely on these class definitions.",
