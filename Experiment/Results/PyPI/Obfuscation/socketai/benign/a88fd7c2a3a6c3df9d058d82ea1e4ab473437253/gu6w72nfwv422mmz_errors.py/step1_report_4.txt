{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names for use in a larger Python program.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from Exception, no input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class definitions are static and do not involve data flow or manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, which might be intended to hide their purpose; no other suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple class definitions inheriting from Exception, with highly obfuscated names. There are no method implementations, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The obfuscation of class names could be intended to hinder analysis but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets, input/output handling, or network activity are present. The structure is consistent with defining custom exceptions for larger applications, possibly to conceal their purpose through obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated custom exception class definitions with no apparent malicious behavior. The obfuscation might be intended to hide their purpose but does not suggest malicious intent per se.",
