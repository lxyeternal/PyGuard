  "purpose": "A Python client library for interacting with USGS geospatial APIs, handling spatial data, metadata, and scene searches.",
  "sources": "API responses, internal data structures, shape processing functions, random string generator, environment variables (if any).",
  "sinks": "API response parsing, data structure population, shape object creation, potential network requests, shape and metadata processing.",
  "flows": "Input data (API responses, spatial coordinates, metadata) flows through parsing functions to structured data; API requests flow from method calls to network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, use of random string generator for IDs, complex parsing logic, no hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a geospatial API client with obfuscated naming, performing data retrieval, shape processing, and metadata parsing. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are present. The obfuscation appears to be for code protection or to hinder reverse engineering but does not indicate malicious intent. The data flows are consistent with legitimate API interactions. No malicious sinks or malicious network activity are detected. The code handles spatial and metadata data securely and legitimately.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate geospatial API client with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The obfuscation score is moderate to high (~0.6), justified by the confusing variable and class names. The overall security risk is low (0.2), as no malicious or dangerous behavior is evident.",
