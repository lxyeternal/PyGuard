  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate satellite data CLI with significant obfuscation. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware score (0.1) and moderate security risk (0.3) are justified, but ongoing monitoring is recommended due to the obfuscation."
