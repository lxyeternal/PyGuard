  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a legitimate satellite data downloader with significant obfuscation and incomplete sections. No direct evidence of malware or malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation and irregularities necessitate further review before deployment. The overall risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood remains low. Vigilance and further static/dynamic analysis are recommended."
