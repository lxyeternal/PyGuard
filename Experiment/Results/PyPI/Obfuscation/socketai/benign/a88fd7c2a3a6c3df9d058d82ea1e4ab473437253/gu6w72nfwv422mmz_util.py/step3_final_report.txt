  "purpose": "Parameter definitions and documentation for Landsat scene and product identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'product_id' and 'scene_id' provided as strings.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used solely within documentation; no data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names such as 'ryxCmazdrdiepPbGHboeklKSdWhGoqTH' and 'DjHwJLJUvwVeDgxHTSGnRMYeiNMjUUtQ'; no executable logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of parameter definitions and docstrings with no executable statements, network calls, or data manipulation. Obfuscated variable names are present but appear stylistic or placeholder, not malicious. Multiple reports confirm the absence of malicious activity, with malware scores at zero and low security risks. The obfuscation is moderate but not indicative of malicious intent in this context. Overall, the code is benign documentation with obfuscated identifiers, posing minimal security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, primarily documentation with obfuscated variable names that do not demonstrate malicious behavior. No active security threats or malicious intent are evident from this fragment. The current scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0.4, securityRisk=0.1—are appropriate and consistent with the evidence.",
