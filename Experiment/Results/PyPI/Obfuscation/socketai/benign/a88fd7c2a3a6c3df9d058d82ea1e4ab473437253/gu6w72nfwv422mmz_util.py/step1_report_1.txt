{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions for retrieving information related to Landsat satellite imagery, specifically based on product and scene identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'product_id' and 'scene_id' which are strings provided to the functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not explicitly show data being sent to external systems or untrusted outputs; it likely returns dictionaries with retrieved information.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions which then process and return data in dictionaries. No external network or system calls are visible.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures are present. The code uses obfuscated-like variable names but does not perform any malicious activity or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The provided fragment contains parameter definitions, docstrings, and return types for functions that retrieve information based on identifiers. No code execution, network operations, or data manipulation is shown. Variable names appear obfuscated but this could be a stylistic choice or documentation artifact. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code seems to be standard parameter documentation for data retrieval functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard documentation snippet defining parameters for functions related to Landsat imagery data retrieval. There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks within this fragment.",
