  "conclusion": "The code is a scripting framework with potential security vulnerabilities due to dynamic script generation from untrusted inputs. No active malicious behavior or malware is present. The primary risk is injection if inputs are not sanitized. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware and obfuscation are absent, and the risk is moderate due to injection potential."
