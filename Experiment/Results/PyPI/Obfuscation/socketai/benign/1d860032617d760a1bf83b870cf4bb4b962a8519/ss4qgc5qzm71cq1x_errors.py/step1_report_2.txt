{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for various JavaScript-like error types in Python, with obfuscated class attribute names.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class attribute assignments, likely static data within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external output functions observed.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from input sources to sensitive sinks; class attribute values are static strings.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual pattern of obfuscation through randomly named class attributes containing strings, which appear to be random or encoded. No functional code or logic beyond class definitions and a dictionary mapping error names to classes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes that mirror JavaScript error types, with all attributes named in a non-descriptive, obfuscated manner, holding seemingly random strings. The dictionary maps string keys to these class objects. There are no functions, input/output, network operations, or data processing. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious behavior. No code injection, data leakage, or external communication mechanisms are present. Overall, the code's intent seems to be to set up error class mappings, with no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup of custom exception classes with obfuscated internal attributes. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation does not seem to serve a harmful purpose but may be for concealment.",
