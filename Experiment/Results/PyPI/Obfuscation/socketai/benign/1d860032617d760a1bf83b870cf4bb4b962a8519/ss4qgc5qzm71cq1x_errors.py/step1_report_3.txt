  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to JavaScript-like error types and map them in a dictionary.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string assignments, dictionary initialization.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Class attribute assignments to string literals, dictionary mapping class names to class objects.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names mimicking JavaScript errors, redundant class inheritance, obfuscated attribute names with random strings. No actual code execution or data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions, with class-specific attributes assigned to seemingly random strings. These classes appear to serve as placeholders or mimic JavaScript error types but do not perform any actions, input/output operations, or data processing. The dictionary 'jserrors' maps string keys to class objects, which is a common pattern for error handling or referencing exception types.\n\nThere is no evidence of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hidden backdoors. The random strings assigned to class attributes do not appear to serve a malicious purpose but might be for obfuscation or placeholder data.\n\nNo signs of code injection, hardcoded credentials, or network activity are present. The code is primarily static class definitions and a dictionary mapping.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup of custom exception classes with obfuscated attribute names and a mapping dictionary. It does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The overall structure is straightforward and does not perform any harmful operations.",
