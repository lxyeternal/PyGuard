{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes with obfuscated attribute names, serving as error representations without active malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and attribute assignments; no data input, external data sources, or dynamic data flows.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks, external communications, or code execution points identified.",
  "flows": "Static class definitions with attribute assignments; no data flow or external interaction pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated attribute names and string literals; no functional logic or data processing; potential superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static class definitions for various error types, with obfuscated attribute names and string values. No functions, data handling, network activity, or dynamic behavior are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment or placeholder purposes. No evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities is observed. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as there are no malicious actions. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), reflecting the obfuscated attribute names, but this does not imply malicious intent. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), given the static nature and lack of active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of static, obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate the security risk or malware likelihood. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
