  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to JavaScript-like errors, with obfuscated class attributes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and attribute initializations, no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; class attributes are static strings.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated attribute names and strings; redefinition of built-in exceptions as subclasses; no functional logic or data processing; potential for concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes mirroring JavaScript error types, with obfuscated attribute names containing seemingly random strings. Some classes subclass built-in exceptions, and others directly subclass Exception. There is a dictionary mapping error names to classes. The obfuscation and lack of functional logic could be used to hide malicious intent or evade detection, but there is no active malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. The code appears to be a set of error class definitions with obfuscation rather than malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines obfuscated exception classes without any malicious behavior or system impact. The obfuscation might be suspicious but does not indicate malware or security risk by itself.",
