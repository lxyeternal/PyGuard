  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of static, obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate the security risk or malware likelihood. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary."
