  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes mirroring JavaScript error types in Python and map them in a dictionary.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class attributes; no external input or data reads.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Class attribute assignments are static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated attribute names and values; all class definitions are straightforward and do not perform any operations beyond attribute assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code creates several custom exception classes that inherit from built-in Python exceptions or base Exception, assigning obfuscated string values to class attributes. The purpose appears to be mimicking JavaScript error types in Python. The 'jserrors' dictionary maps string names to these classes for reference. There are no input/output, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The obfuscated attribute names and values could be for concealment but do not perform any malicious actions. Overall, the code is a benign class and dictionary setup with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines custom exception classes with obfuscated attribute names and maps them in a dictionary. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks identified. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment, but does not introduce any security concerns.",
