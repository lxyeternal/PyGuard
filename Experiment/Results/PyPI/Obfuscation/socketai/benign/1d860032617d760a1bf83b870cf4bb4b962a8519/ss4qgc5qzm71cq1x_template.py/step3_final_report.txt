  "purpose": "A simple HTML page loading an external script 'DicksonUI.js' with an unused, obfuscated variable.",
  "sources": "The external script '/DicksonUI.js' and the unused variable 'SkkJqaWJdFRQwqoxgheTGMtxoYWpwzeT'.",
  "sinks": "The external script source; potential for malicious code execution if the script is malicious.",
  "flows": "HTML loads the script; the variable is defined but unused; no data flows from untrusted sources within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated but is unused; no embedded malicious code or obfuscation in the HTML itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign HTML template that loads an external JavaScript file. The variable name looks obfuscated but is unused, indicating no malicious intent within this snippet. The main risk depends on the trustworthiness of 'DicksonUI.js', which cannot be assessed here. Malware score is 0, obfuscation suspicion is low to moderate (0.2), and overall security risk is low (0.2). The code itself does not contain malicious behavior or obfuscation, and the risk is external dependency-based.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is safe and benign; the primary concern is the external script's trustworthiness. The obfuscated variable is unused and does not contribute to risk. Current scores are appropriate: malware 0, obfuscation 0.2, security risk 0.2. Further review of 'DicksonUI.js' is recommended before deployment.",
