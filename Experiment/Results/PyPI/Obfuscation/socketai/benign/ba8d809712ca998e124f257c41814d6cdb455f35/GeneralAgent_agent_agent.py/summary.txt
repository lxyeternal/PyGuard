  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, complex framework capable of executing dynamic code snippets, which poses a moderate security risk if misused. No explicit malicious activity such as network exfiltration or destructive commands is evident, but the capacity for runtime code injection and concealment warrants careful review and secure handling. The overall malware likelihood is moderate (~0.3), obfuscation is high (~0.85), and the security risk is also moderate (~0.65). Further analysis in a controlled environment is recommended before deployment."
