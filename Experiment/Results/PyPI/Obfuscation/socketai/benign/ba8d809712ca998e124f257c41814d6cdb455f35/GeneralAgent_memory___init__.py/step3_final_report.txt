  "purpose": "Import a class 'NormalMemory' from a local module 'normal_memory'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external input or data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows, no data leaks, no external communication.",
  "flows": "Import statement is static; no data flow from source to sink as no runtime data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs detected; straightforward import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing 'NormalMemory' from a local module. No code execution, data handling, or external communication occurs. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The code is standard Python module import syntax, with high confidence in benignity. No anomalies or security concerns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The import statement is standard and safe. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0. The confidence level is 1, reflecting certainty based on the minimal and straightforward code snippet.",
