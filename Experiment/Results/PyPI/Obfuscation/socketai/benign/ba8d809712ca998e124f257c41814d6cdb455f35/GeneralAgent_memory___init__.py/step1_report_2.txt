  "purpose": "Import the NormalMemory class or function from a local module named normal_memory",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module in the same package/directory",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially dangerous operations are present",
  "flows": "The code only imports a class/function; no data flow analysis is applicable here",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a relative module, which is standard practice. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. As it is only an import statement, it does not involve any input handling or data processing that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign, serving only to import a class or function from a local module. No malicious intent or security risks are indicated.",
