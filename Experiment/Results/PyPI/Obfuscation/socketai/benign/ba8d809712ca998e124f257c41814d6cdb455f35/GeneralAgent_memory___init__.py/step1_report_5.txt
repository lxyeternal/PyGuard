  "purpose": "The code imports the NormalMemory class from a local module named normal_memory.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module file.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data or untrusted inputs are processed or outputted.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths as this is only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Only a simple import statement; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement importing a class from a local module. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activities. As it is just an import, it does not execute any code directly or perform any operations that could be harmful. No embedded malicious code or unusual patterns are present. The simplicity suggests it is a typical code import statement.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is a typical part of Python code structure for modular design.",
