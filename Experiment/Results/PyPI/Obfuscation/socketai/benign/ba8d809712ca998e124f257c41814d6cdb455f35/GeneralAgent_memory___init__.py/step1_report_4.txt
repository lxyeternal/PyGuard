  "purpose": "Import the NormalMemory class from the local module normal_memory, likely for use in memory management or storage within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement imports code from a local module file 'normal_memory.py'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this line; no data processing, network operations, or system calls are visible.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no anomalies. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code only imports a class from a local module, which by itself poses no security risk. No input reading, data leakage, or untrusted data handling is evident. Since the code is minimal, it cannot be evaluated for malicious behavior without additional context.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard import used in Python projects.",
