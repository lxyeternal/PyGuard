  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a simple import statement importing `NormalMemory` from a local module `normal_memory`.\n- No data flows, sinks, or suspicious behaviors are identified.\n- The code snippets are minimal and standard, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious activity.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.8 to 1), which aligns with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Code:\n- The original code is:\n  ```python\n  from .normal_memory import NormalMemory\n  ```\n- The reports correctly interpret this as a simple import statement from a local module.\n\n### Error, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- No errors or mistakes are evident in the reports.\n- The logic is consistent; all reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Scores Review:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the benign import.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All assign 0, consistent with the straightforward import.\n- **Security Risk:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), which is reasonable for such minimal code.\n- **Confidence:** High, reflecting the clarity of the code.\n\n### Justification for Risk and Malware Scores:\n- Since the code only imports a class from a local module, there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The minimal nature of the code and the lack of suspicious patterns justify a malware score of 0.\n- The slight security risk score (0.1) in some reports may reflect a conservative approach, but given the context, even this is probably overstated.\n\n### Potential Issues or Assumptions:\n- No assumptions about malicious intent can be made from this snippet alone.\n- If additional context revealed dynamic code execution or untrusted sources, the risk could increase, but based solely on this import, it remains benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0.1** (keeping a very conservative minimal risk level, but arguably it could be 0)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The code is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate; no changes needed.\n- The overall risk is negligible based on this snippet.\n\n**Final recommendation:** The code is safe, with no security concerns.",
