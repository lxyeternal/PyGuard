  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine whether the issues are valid, whether the scores are appropriate, and if any adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .normal_memory import NormalMemory`.\n- No code execution, data handling, or external communication is involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The code appears standard and benign.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import class from local module.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity or anomalies.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- Similar to Report 1, straightforward import.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.\n\n**Verdict:** Also reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.9), minor securityRisk (0.1), but still no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.9.\n\n**Justification:** Given the minimal securityRisk score and no malware indication, this seems appropriate. The small securityRisk score is conservative, possibly reflecting the fact that import statements could be part of larger malicious payloads if context were available. Still, based solely on this line, no change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- Similar to others, with slightly lower confidence (0.8) and securityRisk (0.1).\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate, given the minimal context.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- Confidence at 0.9, no anomalies.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of findings:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** All are 0, consistent with the straightforward import statement.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly 0, with some at 0.1 for minor uncertainty, which is acceptable given the minimal context.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The code is a simple import statement, standard in Python projects.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0, since there's no indication of any security concern.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scoring is reasonable. No adjustments are necessary. The code snippet is benign, and the assessments reflect that appropriately.",
