  "conclusion": "The code fragment appears benign, consisting only of static imports with obfuscated class names. No active malicious activity is evident. The obfuscation warrants further inspection of the imported modules to confirm their safety. The current scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating low malware risk but high suspicion due to obfuscation."
