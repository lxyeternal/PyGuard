{
  "purpose": "Importing various interpreter classes from local modules, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules with obfuscated or non-descriptive class names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow present; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are cryptic and non-descriptive, suggesting obfuscation or autogenerated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated class names, indicating potential concealment but no active malicious behavior. No functions, network operations, or data processing are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score (0.2) and low security risk score (0.2) are appropriate given the evidence. The high obfuscation score (~0.75) reflects the cryptic class names. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to ensure they do not contain hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment appears benign, consisting only of static imports with obfuscated class names. No active malicious activity is evident. The obfuscation warrants further inspection of the imported modules to confirm their safety. The current scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating low malware risk but high suspicion due to obfuscation.",
