  "purpose": "Importing various interpreter classes from local modules, likely to handle multiple scripting languages or command types.",
  "sources": "Module import statements that load classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that processes untrusted data; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; only class imports occur.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names appear as random strings, which may indicate obfuscation or generated names; however, no malicious behavior is evident from import statements alone.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several classes from local modules with seemingly random or obfuscated class names, possibly indicating code obfuscation or generated code. No data processing, network activity, or system modification is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or hidden code. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard import statements with obfuscated class names, likely part of a larger project. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet. The randomness of class names could be obfuscation but does not suggest malicious intent on its own.",
