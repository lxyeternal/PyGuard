{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import modules or components related to 'skills' and an 'Agent' from subpackages within a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The code reads from relative module imports: '.skills' and '.agent.agent'.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution of untrusted code within this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident here as this snippet only performs import statements without processing data or user input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard in structure. No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two relative import statements, which are typical for modular Python packages. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as code injection, data leakage, or hidden backdoors. The code is straightforward and lacks any suspicious or unusual elements. Since the snippet does not include execution logic, network activity, or data handling, it cannot be associated with malicious intent based solely on these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign set of import statements typical for a modular Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment.",
