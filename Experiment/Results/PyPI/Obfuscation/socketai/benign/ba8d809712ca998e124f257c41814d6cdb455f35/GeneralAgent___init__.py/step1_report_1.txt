{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules related to skills and an agent, likely for a larger system or application involving AI or automation components.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .skills and .agent.agent",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leakage points are evident in these imports",
  "flows": "Imports do not establish data flow paths; they merely include code modules",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present in the snippet",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements from local modules, which is standard for modular Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious patterns. The code does not interact with external data sources, execute untrusted input, or perform any risky operations. Since the code is minimal and only imports modules, there are no apparent vulnerabilities or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger, benign codebase.",
