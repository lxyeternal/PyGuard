{
  "purpose": "The code imports two modules from local package structure, likely for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The import statements read module files: .skills and .agent.agent.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources; the code simply imports modules without executing further logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from local modules, with no runtime logic, data handling, or external interactions. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of these imports, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscation scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present, and the scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing standard module import statements with no security concerns. The current scores and assessments are appropriate and do not require modification.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
