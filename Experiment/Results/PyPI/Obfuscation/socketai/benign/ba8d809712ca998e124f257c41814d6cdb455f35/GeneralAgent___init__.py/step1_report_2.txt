{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules 'skills' from the current package and 'Agent' from a subpackage 'agent'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'skills' and 'agent.Agent'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or system calls present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements are static.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only includes imports without any execution logic. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements referencing local modules within the package. There are no variables, function definitions, or dynamic code execution. The absence of runtime behavior, network activity, or data handling suggests no malicious intent or security issues. The code appears standard for modular Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple import statement without any suspicious or malicious features. It does not exhibit any security risks or malware characteristics based on the given snippet.",
