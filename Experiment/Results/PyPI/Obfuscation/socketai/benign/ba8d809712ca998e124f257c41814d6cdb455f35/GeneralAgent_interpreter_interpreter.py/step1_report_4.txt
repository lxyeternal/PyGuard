  "purpose": "Abstract base class providing pattern matching functionality with customizable regex and validation methods.",
  "sources": "Potentially the 'bBbVjFuLSsTgyRtTNRJqsUrHyrYmqdBW' attribute for regex patterns, input 'string' in methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods process input strings, but no sinks directly handle untrusted data in a malicious manner. No network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input 'string' flows through 'ILrVrFRnefGRYPwiUGqXwNUgUqVMBpEG' method for pattern matching, based on stored regex pattern.",
  "anomalies": "Code is highly obfuscated with meaningless class and method names. No actual implementation beyond pattern matching. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious imports beyond 're' and 'abc'.",
  "analysis": "The class is an abstract base class with methods for regex pattern validation. The pattern attribute is initially None, and methods perform pattern matching with no evident malicious intent. No network or file operations are present. Method names and class name appear deliberately obfuscated, possibly to conceal purpose, but no actual malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. The code’s simplicity and lack of harmful operations suggest benign intent, despite obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated abstract class designed for pattern matching, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal purpose but does not introduce malicious intent.",
