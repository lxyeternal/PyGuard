  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python package intended for general utility functions or application logic. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, external libraries, and possibly user inputs via standard input or function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, and system command executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network modules or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code constructs were detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data processing tasks, utilizing standard Python libraries. No obfuscated code, such as dynamic eval or exec with untrusted input, was found. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or system damage routines. The structure and formatting appear consistent with normal Python packages. Environment variables are used in standard ways, and no suspicious network activity is evident. The overall code seems to serve legitimate purposes with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a standard, benign Python package. The security risk is minimal, with no immediate threats identified.",
