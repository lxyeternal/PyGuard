  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code execution points, network connections, data handling, environment variables, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks through data processing or control flow, potential data exfiltration or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, dynamic execution patterns, unusual imports.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. No suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs are detected. The code appears straightforward with standard library usage. The confidence in benign nature is high (0.8), with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk score remains low (0.2), reflecting minimal threat. No anomalies or suspicious flows are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected. The scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating a safe component.",
