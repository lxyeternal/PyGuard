  "purpose": "Define typed data structures for audio and voice configuration settings, including categories, personalities, and metadata.",
  "sources": "No input reading; only type definitions and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; purely data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; code only defines types and constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple TypedDict class definitions used for typing and data validation purposes. It includes literal types, optional fields, and nested structures relevant to audio or voice configurations. No functions, external data handling, or runtime logic is present. There are no indications of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. The structure appears standard for a type annotation module, with no obfuscated patterns, backdoors, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward set of type definitions for managing voice and audio metadata. It poses no security risks, malware, or malicious intent. The code's purpose is solely to enforce data structure contracts.",
