  "purpose": "Definition of various TypedDict classes representing structured data related to audio, categories, voices, and user information.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources; the code mainly defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; no data processing or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected. All data structures are standard and contain no executable or malicious content.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions using TypedDict to model data structures with fixed and optional fields. No runtime code, external input handling, or network operations are present. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be standard type annotations for a larger system, with no indications of hidden malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a set of data structure definitions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is likely part of a larger application and does not pose security risks by itself.",
