  "purpose": "Define typed data structures for audio, content, voice profiles, and related metadata.",
  "sources": "No external data input; only type definitions and class structures are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or data transmission mechanisms are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks since this is solely type definition code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or unusual code patterns are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of TypedDict classes and type annotations for various data structures related to audio and voice content. There are no functions, data processing, or input/output operations that could be exploited or contain malicious payloads. The code appears to serve as data schema definitions without any executable logic, making malicious behavior unlikely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely type definitions for structured data, with no suspicious or malicious activity. It does not contain any obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The risk is minimal, and no security concerns are identified.",
