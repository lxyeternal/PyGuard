  "purpose": "Type definitions for audio and voice configurations, serving as data schemas without runtime logic.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and attribute assignments within the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, external data flow, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines data structures without data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names in some classes (e.g., cEeWGBvuXBHzWwaGnbnwAIlhwdwaLvuu), which could suggest obfuscation but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of TypedDict class definitions with no runtime logic, network operations, or data handling. The obfuscated names in some classes are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior. The malware score is appropriately zero across all, and the obfuscation scores are moderate due to nonsensical naming. Risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Slightly increasing obfuscation scores in some reports to better match the suspicion level is reasonable. Overall, the code appears to be benign data schemas with no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data schema definitions with obfuscated naming but no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate; obfuscation is noted but does not imply malicious intent. No modifications are necessary.",
