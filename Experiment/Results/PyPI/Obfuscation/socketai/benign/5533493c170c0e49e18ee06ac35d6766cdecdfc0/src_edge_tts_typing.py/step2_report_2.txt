  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code defines data structures with no runtime logic, no secrets, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate. The code is straightforward type definitions with no obfuscation or malicious content.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated class and attribute names raise suspicion, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscation:** The class names like `cEeWGBvuXBHzWwaGnbnwAIlhwdwaLvuu` and attribute names are indeed nonsensical, which could suggest obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No runtime logic, no data leaks, no code injection. The obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious intent but warrants caution.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2 — seems reasonable.\n- **Justification for scores:**\n  - Obfuscation is high (0.7), reflecting suspicion.\n  - Malware is 0, consistent with no evidence.\n  - Security risk is low (0.2), acknowledging potential concealment but no active threat.\n\n**Note:** The report's conclusion appropriately states there's no direct malicious behavior, just obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 2, with obfuscated names but no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** Moderate (0.3), which seems reasonable given the nonsensical class names.\n- **Malware:** 0, no evidence.\n- **Risk:** 0.2, cautious but not alarming.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion aligns with the data.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Clear, straightforward data structures with no suspicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, only data structures, no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation\n\n- The only notable concern is in reports 2 and 3, where obfuscated class names could be an attempt to conceal intent. However, the reports correctly assign a high obfuscation score but low malware risk, which is justified given the absence of malicious code or runtime logic.\n- All reports agree that these are data structure definitions with no active malicious behavior.\n\n### My Overall Estimate:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious payloads or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** ~0.4 — some obfuscation present, but not definitively malicious.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, mainly due to obfuscation suspicion but no active threat.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be benign, serving as data schemas. The obfuscation may be intentional or auto-generated but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** All scores are consistent with the analysis. No changes needed unless further context suggests otherwise.",
