  "purpose": "Parse a version string into a tuple of integers.",
  "sources": "The variable dXQiORpZsVkIuQTNsNNpIMzHhYWaOdAN, which contains the version string '7.0.1'.",
  "sinks": "The tuple created from the split version string, potentially used elsewhere in the larger codebase.",
  "flows": "The split string from dXQiORpZsVkIuQTNsNNpIMzHhYWaOdAN is converted into integers and stored in a tuple.",
  "anomalies": "Code appears straightforward; no suspicious variables, obfuscated techniques, or hidden behaviors. The variable names are obscure but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable, then splits this string by '.' and converts each part into an integer, storing the result in a tuple. There are no external data sources, no untrusted inputs, and no dangerous operations like code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration. The variable names are non-descriptive but do not suggest malicious purposes. The logic is simple and standard for parsing version strings, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic version string parser with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a harmless utility function within a larger application.",
