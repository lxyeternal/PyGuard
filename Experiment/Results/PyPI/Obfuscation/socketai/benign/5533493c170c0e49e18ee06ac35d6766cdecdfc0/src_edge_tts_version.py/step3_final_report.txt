  "purpose": "Parse a static version string into a tuple of integers.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded string assigned to a variable, then splits it by '.' and converts each segment to an integer.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only processes a static string internally.",
  "flows": "The static string is split into parts, each converted to int, and stored in a tuple; no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent; no malicious or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static version parser with no external inputs, network activity, or obfuscation techniques beyond variable naming. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation concerns are evident. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is around 0.2-0.3 due to variable naming, and the security risk score is approximately 0.1, reflecting minimal risk. The code's simplicity and static nature make it safe, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward version string parser with no security risks or malicious behavior. The obfuscation is superficial and does not suggest malicious intent. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
