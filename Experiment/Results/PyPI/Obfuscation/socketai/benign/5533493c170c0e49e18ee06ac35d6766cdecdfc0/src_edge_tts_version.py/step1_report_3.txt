  "sources": "dXQiORpZsVkIuQTNsNNpIMzHhYWaOdAN, which is a hardcoded version string",
  "sinks": "Tuple construction converting string parts into integers",
  "flows": "Reading the version string, splitting it, converting each part to int, and creating a tuple",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual behavior; the code simply processes a static string",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string variable and then creates a tuple of integers by splitting the string on periods. It uses a generator expression for conversion. The string is hardcoded and static, and the operations are straightforward data processing. No external inputs, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or malicious behavior are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign parsing of a static version string into a tuple of integers. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
