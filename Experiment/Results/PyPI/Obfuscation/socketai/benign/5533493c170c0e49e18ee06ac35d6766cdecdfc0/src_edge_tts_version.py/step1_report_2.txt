  "purpose": "Parse a version string into a tuple of integers.",
  "sources": "The variable dXQiORpZsVkIuQTNsNNpIMzHhYWaOdAN containing the version string.",
  "sinks": "The tuple conversion process, which converts version parts into integers.",
  "flows": "The string split from the version variable flows into the tuple comprehension, converting each part into an integer.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code appears straightforward and benign, with no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string and splits it by periods. It then converts each segment into an integer, storing the result in a tuple. The process is a standard way of parsing version numbers. No external inputs, no network activity, and no sensitive data handling are involved. The code does not perform any actions beyond parsing the version string.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply parses a version string into a tuple of integers. There are no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It appears to be benign and straightforward.",
