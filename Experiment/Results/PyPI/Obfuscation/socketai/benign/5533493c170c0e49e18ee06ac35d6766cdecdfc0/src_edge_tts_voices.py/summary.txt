  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate voice data management component with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review, but overall security risk is low. The malware score should be set at 0.1, obfuscation at 0.7, and overall security risk at 0.2, reflecting a cautious but benign assessment."
