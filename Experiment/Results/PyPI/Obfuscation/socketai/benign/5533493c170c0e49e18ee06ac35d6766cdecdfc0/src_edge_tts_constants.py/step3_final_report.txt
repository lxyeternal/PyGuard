  "purpose": "Setup configuration for Bing speech API interaction, including URL construction and headers.",
  "sources": "Variables BASE_URL, TRUSTED_CLIENT_TOKEN, and other parameters used in URL and header formatting.",
  "sinks": "None; code only constructs URLs and headers, no data processing or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Variables are used to build URLs and headers; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names in some instances; presence of hardcoded token 'ddpHrSNlIbdYphMQrGJqwySLKTrIgblc'.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward URL and header setup for Bing speech API, with no malicious code or obfuscation in the core logic. The main security concern is the hardcoded token, which could be sensitive if exposed, and the use of obscure variable names in some parts. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose appears to be legitimate configuration for API requests.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard API setup code with some security considerations regarding hardcoded secrets and variable obfuscation. No malware or malicious intent is detected. The security risk is low but warrants proper secret management. Obfuscation in variable names is notable but not malicious.",
