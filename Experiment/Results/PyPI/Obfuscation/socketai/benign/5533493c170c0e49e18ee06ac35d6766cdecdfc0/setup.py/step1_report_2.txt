  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "import statement from setuptools; hardcoded string 'qfjaqqxfgtbwrb77' assigned to a parameter in setup()",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, but the hardcoded string assigned to a parameter could be a placeholder or malicious code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the hardcoded string is an embedded value with no external input involved.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly random string 'qfjaqqxfgtbwrb77' assigned to a parameter named 'oiknSXKqApwyePpohIUtYhujOUySsYFm', which does not correspond to standard setup() parameters. This could be an obfuscated or malicious attempt to hide malicious behavior or payload.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with a non-standard parameter 'oiknSXKqApwyePpohIUtYhujOUySsYFm' set to a string. The parameter name is nonsensical, which is suspicious and could be an obfuscated attempt to hide malicious intent or payload. The install_requires list appears normal, specifying common dependencies. No user input or external data sources are present. The hardcoded string may serve as a backdoor, identifier, or malicious trigger, but without further context, it is suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains a suspicious non-standard parameter with a random string, indicating potential obfuscation or malicious intent. The overall risk is elevated due to this anomaly, warranting further investigation.",
