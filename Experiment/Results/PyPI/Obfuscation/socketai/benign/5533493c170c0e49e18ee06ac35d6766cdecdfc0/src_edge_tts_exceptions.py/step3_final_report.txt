  "purpose": "Static obfuscated exception classes with meaningless class and variable names, containing only static strings.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with static string attributes; no input, output, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow, external communication, or system modification.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; static definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation with nonsensical class and variable names; no functional behavior or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of obfuscated class definitions inheriting from a custom exception base class, with static string attributes containing random data. There are no functions, data flows, external interactions, or malicious indicators. The obfuscation appears intentional, possibly to conceal intent or serve as decoys. The static strings do not demonstrate malicious behavior on their own. The code's static nature and lack of behavior justify low malware and security risk scores, while obfuscation warrants high obfuscated scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated placeholder classes with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the low malware and risk scores are appropriate given the static, non-functional nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent and reasonable.",
