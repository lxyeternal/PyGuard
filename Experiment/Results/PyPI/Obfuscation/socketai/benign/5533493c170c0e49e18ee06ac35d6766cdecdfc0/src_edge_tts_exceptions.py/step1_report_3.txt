  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with seemingly random class names and class-level string attributes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class-level attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes only define static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and attribute names that appear obfuscated or nonsensical; no functional code or logic; no input handling or output generation; all attributes are static strings with seemingly random content.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from a custom exception class, with each class containing a single class attribute assigned to a string of random characters. There are no functions, methods, input/output, or dynamic behavior. The class names and attribute names are nonsensical and do not indicate any purposeful logic. The static attributes do not perform any operations or data handling. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, code injection, or system interaction. The code appears to be obfuscated or placeholder code, possibly intended to mislead or hide malicious intent, but as-is, it contains no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of obfuscated class declarations with static attributes containing random strings. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data flow, or security risks. The structure suggests possible obfuscation but does not perform any harmful operations or data handling.",
