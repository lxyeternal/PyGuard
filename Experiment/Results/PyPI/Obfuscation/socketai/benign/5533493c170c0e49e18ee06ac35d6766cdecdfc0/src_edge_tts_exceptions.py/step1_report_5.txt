{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, each with a seemingly random string attribute.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with hardcoded string attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the classes are standalone.",
  "anomalies": "All classes inherit from a base exception class but contain only obfuscated attribute names and static strings, with no functional behavior or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception, with no methods or functional code. Each class has a single attribute assigned a string that appears arbitrary. There are no input handling, no data processing, no network operations, or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated attribute names and static strings could be intended to hide malicious code, but in their current form, they serve no functional purpose and are unlikely malicious. The code appears to be a placeholder or obfuscation but lacks any active or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only class declarations with static attributes and no functional or malicious behavior. There is no evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious activity. It may be obfuscated or placeholder code but does not pose a security threat in its current form.",
