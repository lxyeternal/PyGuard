  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated placeholder classes with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and the low malware and risk scores are appropriate given the static, non-functional nature of the code. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent and reasonable."
