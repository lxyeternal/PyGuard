  "purpose": "Define multiple Flask-WTF form classes for user input validation",
  "sources": "User input from form fields: username, password, full name, email",
  "sinks": "Form validation process, data handling within Flask-WTF forms",
  "flows": "User input -> form fields -> validation functions -> form processing",
  "anomalies": "Repeated field names with ambiguous labels; no apparent malicious activity, but the duplication and naming are unusual and could cause confusion or misbehavior",
  "analysis": "The code defines two form classes with fields that collect username, password, full name, and email. The field names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The use of DataRequired and Email validators is standard. No external data sources, network calls, or code execution occurs. The repeated 'Full Name' fields with different underlying data types may cause form validation issues but do not indicate malicious intent. No backdoors, code injection, or suspicious network activity are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard form validation setup with obfuscated class and field names, possibly to conceal intent. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The unusual naming could be for obfuscation or to disguise functionality, but as written, it does not perform any harmful actions.",
