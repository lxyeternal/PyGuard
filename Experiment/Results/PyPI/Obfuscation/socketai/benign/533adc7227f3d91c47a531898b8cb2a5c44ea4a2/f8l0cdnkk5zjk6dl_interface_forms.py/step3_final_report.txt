  "purpose": "Define user authentication and registration forms using Flask-WTF with obfuscated class and variable names.",
  "sources": "Input fields for username, password, full name, and email, read from form submissions.",
  "sinks": "Data validation via validators; no external data or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "User input flows from form submission to validation functions; no external or malicious data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; duplicate 'Full Name' fields with different validators; no suspicious code logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard FlaskForm classes with common fields and validators. Obfuscated naming is present but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or code injections are observed. The duplication of 'Full Name' fields with different validators could cause validation issues but is not malicious. Malware score is 0, consistent with benign code. Obfuscation score is moderate to high (~0.7), justified by naming. Security risk score is low (~0.2), as no vulnerabilities are evident. The code appears to be benign form definitions with obfuscation as the primary concern, which is adequately reflected in the scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of Flask-WTF forms with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are detected. The current scores and reasoning are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
