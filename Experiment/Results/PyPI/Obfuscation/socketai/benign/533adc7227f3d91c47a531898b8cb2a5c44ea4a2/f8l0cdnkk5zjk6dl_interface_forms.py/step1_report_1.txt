  "purpose": "Define multiple Flask-WTF forms for user input, including login and registration forms.",
  "sources": "User input fields such as username, password, full name, and email in form classes.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data is processed or transmitted within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data from user fields are validated locally within the form; no data flows outside the scope of form validation.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and field names are obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Flask-WTF form classes with multiple input fields. Field labels are in plain text, and validators are standard, such as DataRequired and Email. Class and variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which might suggest attempts at hiding intent, but no malicious behavior or code injection is present. There are no external data sources, no network operations, and no suspicious logic. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward form definitions with obfuscated naming, likely for code hiding or complexity, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simply defining form classes for a Flask application with obfuscated naming conventions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks within this code snippet. The obfuscation does not correlate with malicious intent by itself.",
