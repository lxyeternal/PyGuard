  "purpose": "Define multiple Flask-WTF forms for user input, including login and registration forms.",
  "sources": "User input fields in form classes: StringField and PasswordField instances.",
  "sinks": "Form validation methods that process user inputs, potential data handling points.",
  "flows": "User inputs data into form fields which are validated and potentially processed or stored.",
  "anomalies": "Field names are obfuscated and appear randomly generated; no obvious malicious intent, but unusual naming could hide malicious behavior or backdoors. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two form classes using FlaskForm, with fields for username, password, full name, and email. All fields include DataRequired validators, with one email validator. The obfuscated class and field names are suspicious and could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The code solely handles form definitions without any data processing or external calls, reducing immediate risk. No signs of data leakage, injection, or malicious logic are present. The naming might suggest code obfuscation, but no malicious patterns or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to define user input forms with obfuscated naming but does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. The unusual naming warrants caution, but no malicious intent or malware is evident.",
