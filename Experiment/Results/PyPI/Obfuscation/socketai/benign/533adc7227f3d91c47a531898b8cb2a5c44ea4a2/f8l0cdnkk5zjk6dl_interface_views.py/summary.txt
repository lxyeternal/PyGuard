  "conclusion": "The code is a typical web application with user management and system info features. Heavy obfuscation and suspicious import statements are noted but no concrete evidence of malware or malicious activity. The supply chain risk remains low, though the obfuscation warrants monitoring. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the analysis, and the obfuscation score is adjusted to 0.7 to reflect the suspicion level. The overall security risk is moderate at 0.3 due to obfuscation concerns but no active threats identified."
