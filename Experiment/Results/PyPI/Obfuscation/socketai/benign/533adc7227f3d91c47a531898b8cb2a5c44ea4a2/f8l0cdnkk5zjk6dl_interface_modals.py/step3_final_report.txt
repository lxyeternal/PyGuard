  "purpose": "Defines a user ORM model class with obfuscated class and attribute names, including a method to add and commit the instance to the database session.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters for user data; method that adds the instance to the database session.",
  "sinks": "Database session add and commit operations, which persist data without validation.",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns parameters to attributes; method adds the object to session and commits, persisting data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class, attribute, and method names; no validation or access control in the save method; no external network or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard ORM user model with obfuscated identifiers, performing typical database insert/update operations. No malicious code, network activity, or hardcoded credentials are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The save method could be misused if exposed, but in isolation, it is a common pattern. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.75, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical ORM user model with obfuscated naming, lacking evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a low malware risk and moderate obfuscation concern.",
