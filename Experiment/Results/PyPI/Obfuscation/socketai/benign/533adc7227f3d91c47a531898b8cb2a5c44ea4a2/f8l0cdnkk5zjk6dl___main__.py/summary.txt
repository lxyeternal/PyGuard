  "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware or malicious payloads. Its primary concern is obfuscation and dynamic module loading based on external inputs, which could be exploited if those inputs are malicious. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, indicating low malware risk but moderate obfuscation and potential for exploitation if inputs are compromised."
