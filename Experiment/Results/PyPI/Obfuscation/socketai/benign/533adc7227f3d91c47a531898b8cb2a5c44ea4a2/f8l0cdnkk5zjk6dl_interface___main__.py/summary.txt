  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious primarily because of the obfuscated module name, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious behavior. However, no active malicious actions are demonstrated, and the code appears benign. The current scores are appropriate: malware score at 0, obfuscation suspicion at 0.7, and low security risk at 0.2. Continued monitoring and broader context review are advised to ensure safety."
