{
  "purpose": "Importing a possibly obscure or custom module and calling an info method that warns against direct execution.",
  "sources": "The import statement sourcing the 'pagermaid' module and the call to its 'info' method.",
  "sinks": "The 'info' method call, which could potentially display information, but without more context, no data leak is evident.",
  "flows": "The import of the module followed by the invocation of its 'info' method.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'FrIwahMldzPZzVMPhwZSRcDNAzbbCDxV' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, suggesting potential concealment. The 'info' method call with a warning message is standard but might be used to obfuscate intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module from 'pagermaid', which is a known framework. The module name appears randomly generated or obfuscated, which is unusual and could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent or payload. The call to 'info' with a message indicating the script should not be run directly is typical for modules designed for internal use or to discourage misuse. There is no evidence of data leakage, network activity, or malicious actions in this snippet. The obscured module name warrants suspicion but does not confirm malicious behavior on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary suspicious aspect is the obfuscated module name, which could indicate concealment. The direct use of 'info' with a warning message is standard for modules. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or malware in this fragment, but the obfuscated import warrants caution. Overall, low confidence in malicious intent, but the obfuscation should be reviewed further.",
