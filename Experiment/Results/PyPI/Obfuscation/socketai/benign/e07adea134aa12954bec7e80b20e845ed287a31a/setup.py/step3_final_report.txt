  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, reading metadata and requirements, and configuring installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading '__init__.py' for metadata, 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, and input parameters for setup().",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or dangerous operations detected.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependencies are read from files; no malicious data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import alias for 'os', highly obfuscated variable names, incomplete or malformed setup parameters (e.g., 'platforms', 'entry_points').",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscation via import aliasing and variable naming. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide complexity but does not indicate malicious intent. The malformed setup parameters suggest poor coding quality or incomplete code, not malicious behavior. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, reflecting the absence of malicious code. The obfuscation score (~0.7) is justified given the aliasing and naming patterns. The low security risk (~0.2) aligns with the benign operations, despite obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, albeit obfuscated, setup script with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent and justified.",
