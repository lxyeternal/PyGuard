  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as utility functions for migration and code generation, reading from model attributes and function parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** The functions generate strings for migration scripts, with data flowing from model attributes into string formatting functions.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unsafe code execution. The code is template-based, generating migration scripts rather than executing untrusted code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment; no malware or malicious intent detected. Confidence 0.9, malware score 0.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, accurately describes the code as generating migration scripts based on model attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String formatting produces migration commands; no untrusted code execution.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. The code is straightforward, generating migration commands.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; no malware or security risk. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes the code as generating migration scripts, reading from model attributes.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Generates migration command strings; no untrusted input is executed.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is standard for ORM migration utilities.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; no malware detected. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar understanding; functions generate migration commands based on model data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String formatting produces commands, no execution of untrusted data.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; code is typical for migration scripts.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid; low security risk, no malware. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Again, correctly identifies the code as generating migration scripts from model metadata.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** String formatting creates commands, with no evidence of executing untrusted code.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior; functions are straightforward.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Accurate; no malware, benign utility. Confidence 0.9, malware 0.\n\n**Score adjustment:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Synthesis:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the analysis. The code does not perform any malicious actions, does not execute untrusted input, and only generates migration scripts.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** All reports give a low score (~0.2), which seems reasonable given the context—code is utility for migration, not executing untrusted data or containing secrets.\n\n### **Final Expert Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 — code is clear and transparent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — minor risk if model attributes are maliciously crafted, but typical for migration scripts.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a standard ORM migration utility with no malicious intent or vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis reflects a benign, transparent codebase used for schema migrations.",
