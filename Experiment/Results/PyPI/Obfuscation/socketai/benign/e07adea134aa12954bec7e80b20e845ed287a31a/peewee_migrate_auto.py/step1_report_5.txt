{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a set of functions designed to generate migration scripts for database models, including creating, removing, and modifying models and their fields.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from model attributes such as Model.__name__, Model.table_name, Model.primary_key, Model.indexes, and field definitions passed as arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code generates strings that look like migration commands, which are intended to be executed in a migration context, but do not directly execute untrusted data within this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model attributes and function arguments into formatted strings representing migration commands, which are returned as strings for later execution.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution; functions appear to generate code strings based on model metadata and input fields without executing or evaluating untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs migration scripts based on model metadata and input fields, with functions to add, remove, and modify models and fields. It uses string formatting to generate migration commands, relying on model attributes and provided field lists. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors are present. The functions serve to generate migration scripts rather than executing potentially malicious code. The use of string formatting to produce code commands is typical for migration tools and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the code is standard for migration script generation with no suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility functions for generating database migration scripts based on model metadata and field definitions. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. No security risks are identified. The code appears benign and purpose-driven for migration automation.",
