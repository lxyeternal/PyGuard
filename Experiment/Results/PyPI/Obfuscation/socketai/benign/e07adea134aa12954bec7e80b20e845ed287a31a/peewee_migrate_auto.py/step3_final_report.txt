{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for generating database migration scripts based on model metadata and parameters, facilitating schema changes such as creating, removing, or altering models and fields.",
  "sources": "Model attribute access (e.g., Model.KIuWqDLhOcmLdNinKiFwFxPzUnsncJNn), function parameters (e.g., model instances, field lists), and model class variables.",
  "sinks": "String outputs that format migration commands; no execution of untrusted code or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model attributes and parameters into string formatting functions to produce migration script strings, which are then returned or used by migration frameworks.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The code is straightforward and relies on controlled model data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of functions that generate migration commands via string formatting, based on model metadata such as table names, fields, indexes, and primary keys. There is no evidence of code execution of untrusted input, network activity, or malicious payloads. The functions operate solely on model attributes and parameters, producing strings for migration scripts. No obfuscation or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk ~0.2) are consistent with the code's purpose and behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for ORM migration script generation, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are justified, and no further action is necessary.",
