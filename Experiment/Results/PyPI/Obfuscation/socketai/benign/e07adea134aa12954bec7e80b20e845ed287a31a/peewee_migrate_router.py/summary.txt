  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic code execution features that pose a significant security risk, especially if migration scripts are from untrusted sources. While no direct malicious payloads are confirmed, the patterns are consistent with potential sabotage or exploitation vectors. It warrants thorough review of migration scripts and modules before deployment."
