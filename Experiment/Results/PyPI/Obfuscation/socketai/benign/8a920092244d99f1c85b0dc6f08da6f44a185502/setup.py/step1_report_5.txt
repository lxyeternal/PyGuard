  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration for distribution on PyPI.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; setup function is standard for package distribution.",
  "flows": "Read README.md content, pass static metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (lOUHhFEWpVYzrqeyjmZFvllnNzSFENeT), possibly obfuscated, but they do not execute code or contain secrets. The list of dependencies is standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports 'setuptools', reads a README file, and calls setup() with static metadata. Variable names are intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The dependencies list is typical. No network activity, backdoors, or hidden code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security issues identified. It appears to be a benign package configuration.",
