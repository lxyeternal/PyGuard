  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, intended to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' into a variable; the variable is used within the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications detected.",
  "flows": "Reads file content into a variable, then passes package metadata to setup(); no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; the dependencies list is assigned to a variable with a non-standard key and not passed as 'install_requires' to setup(), which is a functional bug.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which do not imply malicious intent. The main issue is the incorrect usage of the dependencies list: it is assigned to a variable but not passed as a keyword argument ('install_requires') to setup(), leading to potential build failures. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for hiding variable names, but does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is correctly zero; the obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming; the security risk score is low but should be slightly increased to reflect the functional bug.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but contains a functional flaw in dependency specification. No malware detected. Obfuscation is superficial. The main concern is the incorrect setup() usage, which could cause build issues but does not pose a security threat.",
