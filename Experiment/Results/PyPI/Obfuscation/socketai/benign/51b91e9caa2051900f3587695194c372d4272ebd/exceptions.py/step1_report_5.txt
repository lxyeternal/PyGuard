  "purpose": "Import a specific object or function from the 'flywheel_gear_toolkit.utils.manifest' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing a potentially obfuscated or non-standard attribute from a module.",
  "sinks": "None directly evident in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads a module and accesses an attribute, but no untrusted data flow is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "The attribute name 'NLXyspgkiQXrNSoUUNjcsEsRCXJjMFye' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of a specific attribute from a module. The attribute name is unusual and appears to be intentionally obfuscated or generated, which is often a tactic used to hide malicious intent or obfuscate malicious code. Since this is a single import statement with no further context, there's no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscated attribute raises suspicion. Without additional code, it's difficult to determine if this import leads to malicious behavior or if the attribute is used maliciously elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an unusually obfuscated attribute name. While this alone does not confirm malicious intent, the obfuscation warrants further review of the associated module and usage context. No direct malicious behavior is evident at this point.",
