  "conclusion": "The import statement is benign in isolation but uses an obfuscated identifier that warrants further investigation. No evidence of malicious activity is present, but the suspicious naming pattern justifies cautious review of the module's contents. The scores assigned are consistent with the evidence, with a high obfuscation score and low malware risk."
