      "conclusion": "The code is primarily for environment detection and filesystem management, common in container or pipeline scripts. No direct malicious activity or supply chain attack evidence is observed. The obfuscation and cleanup routines warrant caution but are not inherently malicious. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood (~0.1), moderate obfuscation (~0.6), and moderate security risk (~0.3)."

Minor adjustments to confidence scores are recommended for reports lacking code. The overall assessment suggests moderate risk, with some indicators of malicious behavior in the detailed report."

These are common in scientific workflows but should be handled with validation to mitigate potential exploitation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is minimal (0.2), and security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3)."

There is no evidence of malicious activity, security vulnerabilities, or supply chain compromise within this snippet. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code but acknowledging the obfuscation concern."

There is no concrete evidence of malware or malicious activity. The main concern is the obfuscation and the potential misuse of the 'pip install' function with untrusted input, which warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent."
