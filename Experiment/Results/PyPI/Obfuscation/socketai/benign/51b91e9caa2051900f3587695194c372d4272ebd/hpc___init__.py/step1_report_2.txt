  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands; specific details are not visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Without the actual code, flow analysis cannot be concretely performed; generally, data flows from sources to sinks may occur if untrusted input is processed and then used in sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code segments are identifiable in the provided code snippet, which is empty. The code structure and formatting are standard.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of any actual code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. No source or sink usage, anomalies, or malicious patterns are evident without code. The review is limited by missing content.",
