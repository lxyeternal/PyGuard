  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network connections, file operations, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (e.g., environment variables) to sinks (network, file, system), potentially via dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, hardcoded IPs or credentials, obfuscation techniques, lack of input validation.",
  "analysis": "Most reports lack actual code, limiting analysis; they correctly identify the absence of code and assign low scores. Report 5 describes suspicious behaviors such as dynamic code execution, data exfiltration, and obfuscation, justifying higher malware (0.6), obfuscated (0.4), and risk (0.65) scores. Some overconfidence in Report 4's confidence score (1.0) is unwarranted given no code; it should be lowered to around 0.2-0.3. Overall, the scores align with the described behaviors, with the exception of the overly confident assessment in the absence of code.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of reports are appropriately cautious due to lack of code, with Report 5 indicating potential malicious activity justified by its detailed suspicion. Minor adjustments to confidence scores are recommended for reports lacking code. The overall assessment suggests moderate risk, with some indicators of malicious behavior in the detailed report.",
