  "purpose": "Data class for representing file or object metadata, with methods to instantiate from dictionaries, primarily for data handling and extraction.",
  "sources": "Dictionary inputs from external data sources, such as JSON or SDK objects, used to populate class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; the code only maps data from input dictionaries to class attributes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input dictionaries to class attributes during instantiation via class methods.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of long, obscure variable names and garbled comments, likely artifacts of auto-generation or obfuscation; no malicious code or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with various fields related to file metadata. Two class methods create instances from dictionaries, extracting multiple fields. Comments and variable names are unusual and sometimes nonsensical, but no suspicious logic, network calls, or system modifications are present. The code is purely for data modeling and extraction, with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscation appears superficial, mainly in comments and naming conventions, not in code logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a data container with methods to instantiate from dictionaries. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The superficial obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent.",
