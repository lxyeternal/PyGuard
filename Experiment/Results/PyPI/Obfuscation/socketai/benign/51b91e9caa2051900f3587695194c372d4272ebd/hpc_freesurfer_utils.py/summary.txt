  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or malicious behavior but presents moderate security risks due to unvalidated archive extraction and reliance on environment variables. These are common in scientific workflows but should be handled with validation to mitigate potential exploitation. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is minimal (0.2), and security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3)."
