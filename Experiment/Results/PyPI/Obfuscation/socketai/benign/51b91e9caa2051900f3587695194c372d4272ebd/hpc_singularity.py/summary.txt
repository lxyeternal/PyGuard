  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for environment detection and filesystem management, common in container or pipeline scripts. No direct malicious activity or supply chain attack evidence is observed. The obfuscation and cleanup routines warrant caution but are not inherently malicious. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood (~0.1), moderate obfuscation (~0.6), and moderate security risk (~0.3)."
