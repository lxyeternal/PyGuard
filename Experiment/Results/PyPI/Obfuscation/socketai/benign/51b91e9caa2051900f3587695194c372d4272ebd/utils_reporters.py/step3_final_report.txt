  "purpose": "A structured logging utility supporting CSV and JSON formats with multiprocessing support, designed to write logs in a configurable manner.",
  "sources": "Input data from log record objects or keyword arguments, reading class annotations and data attributes.",
  "sinks": "File output (CSV or JSON files), or optional multiprocessing queue for log data transmission.",
  "flows": "Data flows from log record instances or kwargs into formatted data structures, then into file streams or queues.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names that may suggest obfuscation; no network activity, credentials, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate logging utility with data validation, file handling, and multiprocessing support. Obfuscated names are stylistic, not malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The malware score is justified as 0, with low security risk. Obfuscation is moderate to high but appears stylistic. Confidence in benign intent is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured logging utility with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "malware": 0.0,
