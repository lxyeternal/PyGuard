  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mesh validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the routine validation purpose without external threats. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified."
