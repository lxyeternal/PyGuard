  "purpose": "Mesh validation, reindexing, and data integrity checks for mesh processing.",
  "sources": "Input arrays such as vertex indices, face indices, and mesh attributes; external mesh object properties.",
  "sinks": "Construction of mesh objects, validation functions, and index arrays used for mesh data manipulation.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through validation functions, index remapping, and into mesh object creation, with no external network or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flow; straightforward validation routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard validation of mesh indices, ensuring they are unique and within expected ranges, then constructs mesh objects accordingly. It uses numpy for array operations and internal mesh classes for object creation. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads are present. The validation functions check for index range correctness and uniqueness, which are typical for mesh data integrity. The overall structure is clear and consistent with standard geometry processing routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign mesh validation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The low security risk score (~0.1-0.2) reflects the routine validation purpose without external threats. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.",
