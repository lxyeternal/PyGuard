  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "Static variables containing package info, dependencies, and configuration data",
  "sinks": "None; no external input or untrusted data sources",
  "flows": "Data flows from static variables into setup() function call",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and package name, but no malicious code or dynamic behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with static configuration data. Variable names are obfuscated but do not impact functionality. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data sources are present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. All indicators point to a benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, benign setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent in this context.",
