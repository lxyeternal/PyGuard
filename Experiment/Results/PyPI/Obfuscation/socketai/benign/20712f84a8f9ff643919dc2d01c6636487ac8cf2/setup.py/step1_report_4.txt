{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package called 'rw7ptue4y2i9ixtt' that defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static data defining package info, dependencies, entry points, and package structure; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Execution of setup() function with predefined arguments; no external data sinks or malicious data flows observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows involving untrusted input; the code merely calls setup() with static configuration data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; variable names appear random but are consistent within a typical setup script.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup.py file configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points. All data is statically defined and passed directly to setuptools.setup(). There are no indications of dynamic code execution, input reading, or network activity. Variable names are unusual but do not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. The code adheres to typical package setup practices, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script for a Python package with no detectable malicious code or behavior. It only defines package metadata and dependencies in a standard manner. No security risks or malware are present.",
