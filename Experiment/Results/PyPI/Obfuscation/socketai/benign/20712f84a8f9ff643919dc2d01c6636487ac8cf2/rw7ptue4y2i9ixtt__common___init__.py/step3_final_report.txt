  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data processing functions, network or file operations, environment variable usage, external communication points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, external API calls.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network communication or file I/O, possibly via intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity detected; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack concrete code snippets, relying on descriptions indicating benign, standard data handling and processing. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code. Risk scores are low (0.2), appropriate given the limited context but slightly elevated due to uncertainty. Confidence levels are high where code is described, and zero where no code exists. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and the scores are consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions, the code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk scores are justified, and no adjustments are necessary. For reports without code, a risk score of 0 could be considered, but 0.2 remains acceptable given the context. Overall, the assessments are cautious and appropriate.",
