  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but without specific comments or context, it is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from variables, environment variables, and possibly from imported modules or files if present.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to standard output, files, or network connections, or modifies environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code constructs are immediately apparent. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are observed. No dynamic execution or misleading variable names are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard import statements and function definitions, performing expected data handling tasks. No malicious code patterns such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication to suspicious domains are visible. The logic appears straightforward, with no evident attempts to hide or obfuscate intentions. Without external context or hidden modules, there are no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve benign purposes, with no suspicious signals detected.",
