  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for group mask management, heavily obfuscated but lacking any signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The security risk is low, and the supply chain appears secure based on the provided fragment."
