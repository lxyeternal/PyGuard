  "purpose": "Validation of mesh face vertex count and array index bounds to ensure data integrity.",
  "sources": "Input data structures such as face definitions and index arrays.",
  "sinks": "Exception raising on invalid data; no malicious sinks detected.",
  "flows": "Input data is checked for correctness; exceptions are raised if conditions fail.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; no malicious code or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward validation checks on geometric data, raising exceptions for invalid face vertex counts and out-of-bounds indices. Obfuscated naming suggests concealment but does not imply malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications are evident. The validation logic is standard and safe. The high obfuscation score is justified due to naming but does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, and security risk is low, reflecting benign validation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign validation logic with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purposes. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal.",
