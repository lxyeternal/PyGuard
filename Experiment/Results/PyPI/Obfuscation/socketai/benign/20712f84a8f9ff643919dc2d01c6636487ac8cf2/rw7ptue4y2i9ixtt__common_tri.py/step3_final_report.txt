{
  "purpose": "The code copies a numpy array and flips specified faces horizontally, likely for mesh or image processing.",
  "sources": "Input numpy array; the 'face_indices_to_flip' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The function does not write to external systems or files; no sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input array -> validation check -> array copy -> face indices selection -> np.fliplr operation -> return modified array.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; validation call with 'locals()' and placeholder parameters; no external system interactions.",
  "analysis": "The core operation is benign: copying and flipping slices of an array. Obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal code intent but does not indicate malicious behavior. The validation function's purpose is unclear but appears to be a generic check. No network, file, or malicious commands are present. The code's behavior aligns with a utility function, with obfuscation being the primary suspicious aspect.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility performing array flipping with obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscation remains high due to naming, and overall security risk is low. Vigilance is advised if further context reveals hidden behaviors.",
