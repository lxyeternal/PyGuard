  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility performing array flipping with obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscation remains high due to naming, and overall security risk is low. Vigilance is advised if further context reveals hidden behaviors."
