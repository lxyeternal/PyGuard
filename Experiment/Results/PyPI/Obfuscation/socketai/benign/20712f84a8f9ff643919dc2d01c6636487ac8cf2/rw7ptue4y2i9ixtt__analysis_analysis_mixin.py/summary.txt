  "security_risk": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0.65,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code is likely legitimate, serving geometric data processing functions, with obfuscation being the primary concern. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified but should be clarified for transparency. Overall, the security risk remains low."
