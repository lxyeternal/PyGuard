  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated TLS client implementation with insecure logging practices. There is no evidence of active malicious behavior or payloads. The primary concerns are hygiene-related, not malicious intent. Malware score is low, obfuscation is high, and overall risk is moderate due to insecure logs and obfuscation, but no active malware detected."
