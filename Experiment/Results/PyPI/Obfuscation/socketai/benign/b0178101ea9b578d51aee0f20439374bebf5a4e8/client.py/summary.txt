  "conclusion": "While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the code exhibits high obfuscation, cryptographic material handling, and logging of sensitive data, which are common indicators of potential malicious intent or covert operations. The overall security risk is moderate to high, and the code should be reviewed thoroughly before deployment or inclusion in supply chains. The malware likelihood remains moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and cryptographic handling, but no definitive malicious payloads are evident."
