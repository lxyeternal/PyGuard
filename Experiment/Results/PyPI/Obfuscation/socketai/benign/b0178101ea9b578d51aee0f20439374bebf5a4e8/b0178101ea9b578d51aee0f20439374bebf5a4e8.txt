      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the code exhibits high obfuscation, cryptographic material handling, and logging of sensitive data, which are common indicators of potential malicious intent or covert operations. The overall security risk is moderate to high, and the code should be reviewed thoroughly before deployment or inclusion in supply chains. The malware likelihood remains moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and cryptographic handling, but no definitive malicious payloads are evident."

      "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no malicious intent (malware score 0), minimal obfuscation (approximate score 0.2), and low security risk (around 0.2–0.3). The reports are internally consistent and appropriately cautious given the lack of concrete code evidence."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated TLS client implementation with insecure logging practices. There is no evidence of active malicious behavior or payloads. The primary concerns are hygiene-related, not malicious intent. Malware score is low, obfuscation is high, and overall risk is moderate due to insecure logs and obfuscation, but no active malware detected."
