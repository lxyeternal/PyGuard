  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No code snippets provided; analysis based on report descriptions and scores.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data flows identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no source-to-sink data flows can be determined without code.",
  "anomalies": "Moderate obfuscation suspected in some reports (score 0.3), but no concrete malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly acknowledge the absence of code or limited information, leading to low or zero scores for malware and obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the descriptions, with slight variations in obfuscation suspicion (0.3) in some reports. Confidence levels are high where analysis is detailed. No evidence of malicious activity or significant security risks is present. Minor adjustments to risk and obfuscation scores could be considered but are not necessary for consistency.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates no malicious intent (malware score 0), minimal obfuscation (approximate score 0.2), and low security risk (around 0.2–0.3). The reports are internally consistent and appropriately cautious given the lack of concrete code evidence.",
