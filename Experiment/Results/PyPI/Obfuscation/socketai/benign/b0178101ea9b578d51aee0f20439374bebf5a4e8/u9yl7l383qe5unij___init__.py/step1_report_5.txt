  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script, likely intended for general data processing or utility functions, without an explicit or obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, configuration files, environment variables, or network sources (if any are present). Specific sources are not explicitly detailed in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, file writes, environment variable modifications, or system commands, if such actions are present. No explicit sinks identified in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file system, possibly through functions or method calls, but no explicit flow paths can be confirmed from the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated elements detected. The code structure appears standard; no unusual language features or unnecessary dynamic executions are evident.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step review shows no signs of malicious behavior. The code does not contain suspicious patterns such as network connections to unknown domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or hidden logic were found. Overall, the code appears benign and standard in nature.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code seems safe and performs routine operations without suspicious behavior.",
