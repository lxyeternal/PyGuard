{
  "purpose": "The code consists solely of import statements and multiple enum class definitions with obfuscated, nonsensical names, serving as static definitions likely for media components.",
  "sources": "Import statements and enum class definitions, with no data input, network calls, or file I/O.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data or control flows; static enum definitions do not process data or execute logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated enum class names and member identifiers, high obfuscation score (0.8), but no malicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, consisting of enum definitions with obfuscated names, imported modules, and no functions or executable logic. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system modification are present. The high obfuscation suggests concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriately low (0.0 to 0.2), and risk scores are minimal (0.1 to 0.2). The code appears benign, with obfuscation likely for concealment or protection rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated enum definitions with no active malicious behavior or security threats. The high obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. No further action is necessary.",
