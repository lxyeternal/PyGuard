  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build configuration with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores should reflect high obfuscation (around 0.7) but low malware risk (0). The overall security risk remains low, with a need for continued vigilance in the broader project context."
