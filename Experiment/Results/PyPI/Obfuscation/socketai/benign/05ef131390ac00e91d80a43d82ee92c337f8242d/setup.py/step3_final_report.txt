  "purpose": "Build script for configuring and compiling a Windows-specific Python extension module with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "External SDK function 'get_include_dirs()', build configuration parameters, source files ['py.Windows.Media.cpp'].",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks identified; code performs configuration only.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters set based on compiler type; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, which are suspicious but not necessarily malicious; no runtime malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script that conditionally sets compiler flags and includes SDK directories for building a Windows extension. The obfuscated naming suggests potential concealment but no active malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The use of 'get_include_dirs()' appears legitimate, assuming the SDK is trusted. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is high, warranting caution but not definitive malicious intent. Security risk remains low, but obfuscation warrants further review in a broader context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build configuration with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores should reflect high obfuscation (around 0.7) but low malware risk (0). The overall security risk remains low, with a need for continued vigilance in the broader project context.",
