  "purpose": "Simulation and control of a quadrotor trajectory using TinyMPC with visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'tinympc' and numpy, data from arrays, and parameters used for MPC and plotting.",
  "sinks": "Plotting functions that visualize trajectories; no data sinks indicating malicious data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from array definitions into TinyMPC control function; control outputs are used for plotting.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, no clear purpose for some arrays, but no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, sets up matrices and parameters for model predictive control, then performs iterative control calculations, updating the control inputs based on the MPC. The results are stored in arrays and visualized via matplotlib. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious network activity. Obfuscation appears to be limited to variable naming, likely for complexity or intentional obscurity, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior detected. The overall flow aligns with typical control simulation and visualization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to perform a legitimate simulation and visualization of quadrotor control using TinyMPC. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. The obfuscation is limited to variable names, with no evidence of malicious intent.",
