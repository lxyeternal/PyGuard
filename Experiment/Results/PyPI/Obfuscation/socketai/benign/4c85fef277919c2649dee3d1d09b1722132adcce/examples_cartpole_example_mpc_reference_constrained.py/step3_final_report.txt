  "purpose": "Simulation and control of a quadrotor trajectory using TinyMPC with visualization.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from predefined matrices and vectors, and from the 'tinympc' library functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from system matrices and control inputs through the control loop, updating state variables and controls, then visualized via matplotlib.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names; no suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard control simulation for a quadrotor, involving matrix operations, a control loop updating system states, and visualization. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. Obfuscation appears limited to variable naming, which is common in such numerical/control code. The 'tinympc' library is used legitimately. Scores from reports align with this benign assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.3, and low security risk (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate control simulation script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are justified and consistent with the observed behavior.",
