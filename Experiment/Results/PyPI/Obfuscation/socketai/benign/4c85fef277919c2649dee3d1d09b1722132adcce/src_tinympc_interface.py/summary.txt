  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a control and optimization setup with code generation features. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior; however, the subprocess call to 'setup.py' and resource copying operations pose potential security risks if the source or resources are malicious. Obfuscation adds suspicion but is not conclusive. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood remains low. Proper verification of build scripts and resources is recommended to mitigate potential exploitation."
