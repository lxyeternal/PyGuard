{
  "purpose": "Performs cryptographic MPC operations using 'tinympc' with predefined matrices and vectors, likely for privacy-preserving computation or control tasks.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded numpy arrays and parameters used as inputs to the 'tinympc' library functions.",
  "sinks": "Output via print statement of 'controls' data retrieved from the MPC protocol.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the initialized matrices and vectors into the 'tinympc' functions, resulting in control data which is then printed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and method names, no external data input or network activity, no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code executes a sequence of matrix operations within a 'tinympc' cryptographic MPC framework, with no signs of malicious payloads. Obfuscation is present but appears superficial, possibly for code concealment or protection. No external communication, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The structure aligns with legitimate privacy-preserving computation routines. The high confidence score reflects the clear intent and benign nature of the code, despite obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of MPC routines, with obfuscation that warrants caution but no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is zero.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "malware": 0,
