{
  "purpose": "Simulation and control of a dynamic system, likely a quadrotor, using model predictive control via the 'tinympc' library.",
  "sources": "Predefined system matrices, initial states, and control parameters; control object from 'tinympc'; iterative control updates.",
  "sinks": "Control outputs updating system states; visualization via matplotlib; no external data transmission or file I/O.",
  "flows": "System matrices and initial states → control object → control outputs → state updates → plotting.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; undefined variables 'A' and 'B' in the update step, indicating incomplete or inconsistent code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard control simulation, likely for a quadrotor, with no network activity or malicious payloads. Obfuscation appears superficial, possibly auto-generated. The undefined variables 'A' and 'B' suggest incomplete code, but this does not imply malicious intent. No external data leaks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate control system simulation with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The main concern is code completeness, not security. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.4), and the security risk is low (~0.2).",
