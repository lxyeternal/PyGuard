  "conclusion": "The script is a build utility with significant obfuscation. No active malicious activity or payloads are detected. The main concern is obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score (around 0.2) is appropriate, with a high obfuscation score (~0.8). The overall security risk remains moderate (~0.35), primarily due to obfuscation and external command execution. Continuous monitoring and further source code review are recommended."
