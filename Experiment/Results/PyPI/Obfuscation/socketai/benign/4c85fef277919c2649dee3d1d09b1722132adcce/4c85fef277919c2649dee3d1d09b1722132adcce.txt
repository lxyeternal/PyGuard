      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a control and optimization setup with code generation features. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior; however, the subprocess call to 'setup.py' and resource copying operations pose potential security risks if the source or resources are malicious. Obfuscation adds suspicion but is not conclusive. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood remains low. Proper verification of build scripts and resources is recommended to mitigate potential exploitation."

The assessment is cautious but appropriate, with scores indicating no malware and minimal security risk. The lack of concrete code limits definitive conclusions, but current evidence suggests the package is benign."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The assessments are generally appropriate and consistent with the provided descriptions. No evidence of confirmed malicious activity is present, but suspicious features in report 5 justify a cautious approach. Slightly increasing the malware score in report 5 to 0.3 could better reflect the potential risk, but current scores are acceptable. Overall, the analysis aligns well with the evidence, and the risk levels are reasonable given the context."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The script is a build utility with significant obfuscation. No active malicious activity or payloads are detected. The main concern is obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score (around 0.2) is appropriate, with a high obfuscation score (~0.8). The overall security risk remains moderate (~0.35), primarily due to obfuscation and external command execution. Continuous monitoring and further source code review are recommended."

There is no evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious data handling. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or proprietary reasons rather than malicious activity."
