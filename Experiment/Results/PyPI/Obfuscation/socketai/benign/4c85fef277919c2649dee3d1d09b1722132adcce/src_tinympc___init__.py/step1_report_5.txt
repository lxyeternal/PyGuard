{
  "purpose": "The code imports the TinyMPC class from the tinympc.interface module, likely to perform secure multi-party computation tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statement from tinympc.interface, which loads external module functionality.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling functions present; no untrusted data is processed within this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A - only import statement; no data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which loads a class from an external library. There is no evidence of data manipulation, user input, or network communication. Since the code is limited to this single import, it does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks by itself. However, without additional context about the usage of 'TinyMPC', potential risks could arise during its execution, but not from the import statement alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no inherent malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign snippet that alone does not indicate any malicious intent or vulnerability.",
