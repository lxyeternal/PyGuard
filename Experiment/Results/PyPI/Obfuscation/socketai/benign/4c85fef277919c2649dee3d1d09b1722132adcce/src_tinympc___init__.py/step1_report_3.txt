{
  "purpose": "The code imports the TinyMPC class from the tinympc.interface module, likely to use multi-party computation functionalities.",
  "sources": "The import statement is a source; it reads the module tinympc.interface from external packages.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet, as it does not execute any data processing or output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this single line; it only establishes an import relationship.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies such as obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet only contains an import statement, which loads a class from a third-party package. This does not inherently pose security risks. No suspicious behavior, malicious code, or abnormal patterns are detectable. Since this is only an import, it cannot be evaluated for malicious intent beyond confirming it is a legitimate package reference.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard import from a known package for cryptographic or privacy-preserving computations.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
