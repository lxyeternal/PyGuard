  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and assess the scores and conclusions.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: a single import statement importing `TinyMPC` from `tinympc.interface`.\n- The code is minimal, with no execution, data flow, or additional context.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- The reports consistently conclude benign intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues:\n- The code **only** imports a class; there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious constructs.\n- **No issues** are present in the code itself based on the provided snippet.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate regarding the minimal nature of the code.\n- They correctly identify the lack of anomalies or malicious intent.\n- No logical flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n### Score assessments:\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is correct given the code.\n- **Security risk score:** Most reports assign 0, with one assigning 0.1. Given the code's simplicity, even 0.1 seems slightly high unless considering potential risks in the broader context.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since the code only imports a class, **there is no inherent security risk**.\n- Assigning a high risk score (e.g., >0.5) would be unjustified unless additional context suggests malicious intent or vulnerabilities.\n\n### Malware assessment:\n- No evidence of malicious behavior in the import statement.\n- The `TinyMPC` class, related to secure multi-party computation, is a cryptographic library component, not inherently malicious.\n- **Malware score should remain at 0** across all reports.\n\n### Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions:\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the lack of further context.\n- The risk is minimal unless the broader application or usage of `TinyMPC` introduces vulnerabilities, which cannot be assessed from this snippet.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the minimal, benign nature of the code.\n- The slight variation in the security risk score (0 vs. 0.1) is acceptable but could be standardized to 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 for all reports.\n- **Risk score:** 0, as the code is benign and only performs an import.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the minimal code snippet provided.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores should reflect zero malware, obfuscation, and risk, considering the limited context.",
