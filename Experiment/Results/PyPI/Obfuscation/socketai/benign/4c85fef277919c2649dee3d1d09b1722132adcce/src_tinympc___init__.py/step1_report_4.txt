{
  "purpose": "The code imports the TinyMPC class from the tinympc.interface module, likely for implementing secure multi-party computation functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'tinympc.interface' module, which may read package data or configuration at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; the code does not show data output, network connections, or data processing that could leak information.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is a single import statement with no data flow demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a single import statement with no additional logic, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No obfuscated or unusual code features are present.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement, referencing a class within a module. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or control flow. As it stands, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. Since the code is minimal, there is no evidence of hidden malicious intent or supply chain attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and only imports a class from an external library without performing any actions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
