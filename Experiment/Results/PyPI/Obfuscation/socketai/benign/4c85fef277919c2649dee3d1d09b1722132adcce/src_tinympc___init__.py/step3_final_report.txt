{
  "purpose": "This code imports the TinyMPC class from the tinympc.interface module, likely for use in secure multi-party computation tasks.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the tinympc.interface module to access the TinyMPC class.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sinks or data leaks; the code only imports a class without executing or processing data.",
  "flows": "The code imports the TinyMPC class, which could be used later in the application; no data flow occurs within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no execution, data manipulation, or network activity. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet. The malware score is appropriately zero, as there is no malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is zero, reflecting the clarity of the code. The security risk score should be zero or very close to zero, as the import alone does not introduce vulnerabilities. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports are accurate, and the scores should be set to malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, reflecting the minimal and safe nature of this code snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0,
