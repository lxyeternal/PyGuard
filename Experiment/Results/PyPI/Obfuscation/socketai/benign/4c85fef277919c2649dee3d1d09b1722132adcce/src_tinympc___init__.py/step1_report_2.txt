{
  "purpose": "Import the TinyMPC class from the tinympc.interface module, likely for secure multi-party computation purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the tinympc.interface module, which is a package dependency.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this single line of code.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow can be determined from this isolated import statement alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears straightforward with a standard import statement; no unusual syntax or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that includes a class from an external package. Since it only imports a class and does not execute or manipulate data, there are no obvious security issues, malicious behavior, or anomalous code present. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to determine malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign inclusion of an external library component.",
