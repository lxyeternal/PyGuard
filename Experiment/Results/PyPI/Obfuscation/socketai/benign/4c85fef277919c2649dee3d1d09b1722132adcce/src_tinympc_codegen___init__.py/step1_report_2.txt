  "analysis": "The code provided is empty or non-existent, preventing any evaluation of malicious intent or security issues. Without code, it is impossible to identify sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies. The absence of code means no malicious or security risks can be assessed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears empty or not provided, so no malicious activity is detectable.",
