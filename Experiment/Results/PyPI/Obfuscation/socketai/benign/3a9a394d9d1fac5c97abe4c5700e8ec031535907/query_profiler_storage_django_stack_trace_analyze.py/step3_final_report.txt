{
  "purpose": "The code parses SQL queries, extracting table names, join conditions, and query clauses for analysis or validation within a Django application.",
  "sources": "Input string 'FfbtRqRyjmefLZYhaLKxikcgXazavBPa' provided to 'gnEVSKAmkWaJGtsDvCGKUvYPExryfzDW' function; attributes of 'wwhKCeSdEBtQXiqSjNUEgAzhWXTlaVrE' object such as 'FfbtRqRyjmefLZYhaLKxikcgXazavBPa' and 'LuTlIIcSnTwWdloxRqaSfTErdWGNyRaE'.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission or system modification; primarily internal data extraction and analysis.",
  "flows": "Input string is parsed into a dictionary, from which table names and conditions are extracted; no external sinks or data exfiltration observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string replacement ('%s' -> '1') without sanitization; heavily obfuscated variable and module names; complex control flow that could hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code uses 'mo_sql_parsing' to parse SQL strings, replacing '%s' with '1' to inject a constant value. It extracts 'from' clauses, 'where' conditions, and other query components, handling nested structures and potential join conditions. The obfuscation via variable names and dynamic attribute access suggests an attempt to conceal intent. No network activity, file modification, or data exfiltration is present. The string replacement and complex parsing could be exploited if integrated with unsafe execution contexts, but no active malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a SQL query parser with obfuscation that could be misused in a broader malicious context. There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious activity within this fragment, but the obfuscation and input handling warrant cautious review. The malware score is set to 0.3, reflecting moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and potential misuse; the security risk score is 0.5, indicating moderate concern; the obfuscation score is 0.7, consistent with the heavily obfuscated code.",
