  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits no confirmed malicious behavior but contains patterns that warrant moderate suspicion, especially in Report 1. The scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating a need for further monitoring rather than immediate removal. The code appears benign in most cases, with potential red flags that should be watched for in dynamic analysis."
