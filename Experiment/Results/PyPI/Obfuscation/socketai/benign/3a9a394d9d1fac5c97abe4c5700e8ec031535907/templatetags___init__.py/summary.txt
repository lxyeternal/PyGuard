  "conclusion": "The overall supply chain security assessment indicates low risk for the majority of the code, with a moderate suspicion in Report 1 justifying a malware score of 0.4. The benign reports are correctly scored as non-malicious. The suspicion in Report 1 warrants further investigation but does not confirm malicious intent based solely on behavioral indicators. The scores are consistent with the provided descriptions and analysis."
