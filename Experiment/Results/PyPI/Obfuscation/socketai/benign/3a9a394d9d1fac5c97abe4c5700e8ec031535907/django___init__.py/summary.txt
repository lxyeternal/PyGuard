  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious indicators, including obfuscation, dynamic imports, and eval/exec usage with untrusted inputs, indicating likely malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is justified at 0.75, with obfuscation at 0.6. The code should be considered unsafe for use."
