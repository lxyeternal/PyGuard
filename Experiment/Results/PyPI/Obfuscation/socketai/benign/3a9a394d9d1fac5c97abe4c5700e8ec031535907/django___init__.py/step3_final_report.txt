  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic imports, eval/exec with untrusted inputs, hardcoded URLs/IPs, environment variables, network activity, input streams.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, eval/exec execution points, data exfiltration channels, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or network data flow into eval/exec, dynamic imports, or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with unvalidated inputs, hardcoded network addresses, obfuscation, dynamic imports, suspicious control flow, unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code contains indicators of malicious intent, including dynamic code execution, obfuscation, and hardcoded network addresses. These patterns suggest potential remote code execution or data exfiltration. The presence of eval/exec with untrusted inputs and obfuscated code increases suspicion. No benign patterns or standard security practices are observed. The suspicious behaviors justify high malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious indicators, including obfuscation, dynamic imports, and eval/exec usage with untrusted inputs, indicating likely malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is justified at 0.75, with obfuscation at 0.6. The code should be considered unsafe for use.",
