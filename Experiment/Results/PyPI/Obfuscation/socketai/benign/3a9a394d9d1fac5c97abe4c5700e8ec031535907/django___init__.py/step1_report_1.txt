  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform standard data processing or utility functions, with no obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules. No external input sources such as network, files, or user input are explicitly identified in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or system commands, but none are explicitly present in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flow from inputs to outputs is not explicitly demonstrated; the code performs operations on variables but does not indicate untrusted data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of typical Python constructs, with proper usage of functions, variables, and control structures. No suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, suspicious imports, or hidden backdoors are visible. Without external context or additional code, no malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or security risks. The code appears to be benign and straightforward.",
