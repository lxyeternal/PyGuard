      "conclusion": "The code shows no active malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified by non-descriptive naming but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score remains very low, and the security risk is minimal. The code is likely a benign profiling or configuration utility, with obfuscation as the main concern but no evidence of malicious activity."

      "obfuscated": 0.4,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django template filter with obfuscated variable names. The main issue is a bug referencing an undefined variable, which could cause runtime errors but does not pose a security threat or indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.1). The obfuscation is stylistic rather than malicious. Overall, the code is safe but should be fixed for correctness."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The overall supply chain security assessment indicates low risk for the majority of the code, with a moderate suspicion in Report 1 justifying a malware score of 0.4. The benign reports are correctly scored as non-malicious. The suspicion in Report 1 warrants further investigation but does not confirm malicious intent based solely on behavioral indicators. The scores are consistent with the provided descriptions and analysis."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and employs complex runtime inspection and decision caching, which could be used for stealthy analysis or malicious purposes. However, no explicit malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The overall risk is moderate, with a low likelihood of malicious intent based solely on this snippet. The obfuscation and inspection techniques warrant caution, but the code does not confirm malicious behavior."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a SQL query parser with obfuscation that could be misused in a broader malicious context. There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious activity within this fragment, but the obfuscation and input handling warrant cautious review. The malware score is set to 0.3, reflecting moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and potential misuse; the security risk score is 0.5, indicating moderate concern; the obfuscation score is 0.7, consistent with the heavily obfuscated code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, profiling utility for Django ORM queries. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation level is moderate but not indicative of malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits multiple malicious indicators, including obfuscation, dynamic imports, and eval/exec usage with untrusted inputs, indicating likely malicious intent. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score is justified at 0.75, with obfuscation at 0.6. The code should be considered unsafe for use."

      "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits no confirmed malicious behavior but contains patterns that warrant moderate suspicion, especially in Report 1. The scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating a need for further monitoring rather than immediate removal. The code appears benign in most cases, with potential red flags that should be watched for in dynamic analysis."
