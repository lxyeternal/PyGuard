  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file from the filesystem",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or executed",
  "flows": "Reading README file -> setting up package metadata",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names such as CSRyRCmcPXDRDkGCsTiJKXTLlHSZfLPs and ZgcBosVCMOnVKKVspzSOAdQsBDqecHZo, which appear obfuscated or deliberately misleading",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading a README file and configuring metadata. The code imports 'addresser' but does not use it, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The variable names are obfuscated, suggesting potential attempts to hide intent or simply poor obfuscation. There are no indications of code injection, data leaks, or malicious network activity. The presence of an unused import and obscure variable names are suspicious but not conclusive of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided code. The obfuscation might warrant further review, but overall, it seems to serve its legitimate purpose.",
