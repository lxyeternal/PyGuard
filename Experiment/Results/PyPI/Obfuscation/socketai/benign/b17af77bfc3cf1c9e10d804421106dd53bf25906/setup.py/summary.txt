  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names and an unused import. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify a high malware or security risk score. The overall assessment indicates a benign package with obfuscation as the primary concern."
