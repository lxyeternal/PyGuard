  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate address parsing regex setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. Its obfuscation is typical for regex-heavy modules, and the security risk is minimal. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation around 0.4, and a low security risk score of 0.2."
