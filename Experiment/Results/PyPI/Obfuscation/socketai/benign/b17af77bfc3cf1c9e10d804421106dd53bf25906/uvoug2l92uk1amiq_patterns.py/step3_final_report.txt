{
  "purpose": "Constructs complex regex patterns for address parsing and validation using external configuration data.",
  "sources": "External configuration data such as STREET_TYPE, STATE_CODE, DIRECTIONAL, DIRECTION_CODE imported from config module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; regex patterns are used internally for pattern matching.",
  "flows": "Input data (address strings) are matched against the constructed regex patterns; no data is transmitted or stored.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names and multi-line regex pattern strings; potential for regex-based performance issues (e.g., ReDoS) but no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code builds intricate regex patterns for address components, relying on external configuration data. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. Variable names are obfuscated, but this appears to be pattern complexity rather than malicious obfuscation. The regex patterns are standard for address parsing and do not contain malicious code or backdoors. The potential security concern is regex-based denial of service if input is maliciously crafted, but no active exploitation is observed. The malware score is therefore 0. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.4) due to variable naming and pattern complexity, and the security risk score is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate address parsing regex setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. Its obfuscation is typical for regex-heavy modules, and the security risk is minimal. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation around 0.4, and a low security risk score of 0.2.",
