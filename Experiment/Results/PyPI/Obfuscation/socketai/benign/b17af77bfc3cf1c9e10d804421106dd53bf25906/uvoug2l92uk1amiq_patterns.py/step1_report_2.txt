{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define complex regular expressions and mappings for parsing and extracting address components from text, likely used for address normalization or validation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported modules (.config), predefined regex patterns, and potentially external address data processed with these regex patterns.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex patterns to process address strings; no direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs are evident.",
  "flows": "Source data (address text) flows through regex patterns for extraction, with no evidence of data being sent to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly complex regex with nested patterns, potential for misuse if dynamically constructed. No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code constructs, no obfuscated code, and no external data or network activities observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs detailed regex patterns for parsing addresses, combining multiple address components such as street types, state codes, directions, zip codes, and unit numbers. It imports configuration mappings, constructs regex strings dynamically, and appears to be used for detailed address parsing. No suspicious code patterns, no dynamic code execution, and no evidence of malicious behavior or data leaks. The complexity is consistent with address parsing libraries, with no external network calls, no code injections, or backdoors identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a complex address parsing module that constructs regex patterns for address component extraction. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. The complexity is due to regex pattern construction and not indicative of obfuscation or malware.",
