  "purpose": "Define complex regex patterns for parsing address components and related geographic information in Python.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (re, itertools) and local config module (DIRECTIONAL, STREET_TYPE, STATE_CODE, DIRECTION_CODE).",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; regex patterns are used for parsing input data but do not process untrusted data directly.",
  "flows": "N/A — regex patterns are compiled for matching address strings; no data flow analysis applicable.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous obfuscated variable names and complex multi-line regex strings, which could obscure malicious intent or intent to evade detection. No explicit hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors like network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs complex regex patterns for parsing addresses and geographic data. It uses dynamic string joining, escaping, and pattern composition to generate regex strings for address components like ZIP codes, street types, directions, states, and unit types. The presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., wMCVQeCTwbGGINhBChTEjffGJVEzRCER) and multi-line raw string patterns can be used to hide malicious intent, but in this context, they appear to serve the purpose of pattern building. No network calls, file operations, or system modifications are present. The code does not perform any data processing or input/output; it solely prepares regex patterns for future use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex regex pattern construction for address parsing, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscated variable names could be suspicious but are likely just for pattern complexity. No security risks are evident within this snippet.",
