  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent in the most suspicious case (Report 3). Other reports with no code or benign descriptions are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the evidence."
