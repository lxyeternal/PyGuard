  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, dynamic execution functions (exec, eval), suspicious imports, obfuscated variables.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, subprocess calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or file operations, potentially via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, use of eval/exec, suspicious or misleading import statements, high obfuscation levels (0.8), dynamic execution patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code features described include obfuscation, dynamic execution, and suspicious imports, which are classic indicators of malicious intent. Absence of code results in low risk scores. Obfuscation and dynamic execution strongly suggest malicious or potentially malicious behavior, justified by high obfuscation (0.8) and malware scores (0.6). Low scores for other reports align with their lack of suspicious features. The reasoning is consistent across reports, with scores appropriately reflecting the described indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating a high likelihood of malicious intent in the most suspicious case (Report 3). Other reports with no code or benign descriptions are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the evidence.",
