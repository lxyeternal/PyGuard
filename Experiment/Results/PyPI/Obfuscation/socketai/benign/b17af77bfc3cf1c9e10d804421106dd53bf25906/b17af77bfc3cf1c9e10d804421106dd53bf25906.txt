      "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names and an unused import. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify a high malware or security risk score. The overall assessment indicates a benign package with obfuscation as the primary concern."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate address parsing regex setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. Its obfuscation is typical for regex-heavy modules, and the security risk is minimal. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation around 0.4, and a low security risk score of 0.2."

Other reports with no code or benign descriptions are correctly scored as low risk. Overall, the assessments and scores are justified and consistent with the evidence."
