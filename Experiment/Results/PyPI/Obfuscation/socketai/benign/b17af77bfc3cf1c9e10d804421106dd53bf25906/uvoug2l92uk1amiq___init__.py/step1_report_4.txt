{
  "purpose": "Module that imports specific parsing functions for address and location data processing",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (.parser)",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; no data handling or network operations",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only imports functions and defines variables",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'gaJyGcCEUtuxPTnvizBvoClVnRqTvDim' with a version string, which appears obfuscated or placeholder-like; duplicate entry in __all__ list",
  "analysis": "The code imports four functions from a local module, then defines a version string with an obfuscated-looking variable name. The __all__ list includes 'parse_location' twice, which is redundant but not harmful. There are no signs of malicious code, network operations, or data leaks. The variable name and the duplicate in __all__ are anomalies but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign, possibly auto-generated or simplified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module import setup with a redundant __all__ entry and an obscure variable name. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
