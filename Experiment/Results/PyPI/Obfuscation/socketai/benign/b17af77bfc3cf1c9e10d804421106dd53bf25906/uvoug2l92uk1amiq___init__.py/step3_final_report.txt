  "purpose": "Import functions from a local parser module and define a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.parser' module, assignment to obfuscated variable name.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data sinks, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Import functions and assign version string; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'gaJyGcCEUtuxPTnvizBvoClVnRqTvDim', duplicate 'parse_location' in '__all__'.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions, defines a version string with an obfuscated name, and exports functions via '__all__'. No data processing, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated or placeholder-like, and the duplicate in '__all__' is likely a typo or artifact. No malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The anomalies are benign and typical of auto-generated or obfuscated code. The malware score is appropriately 0, as there is no malicious activity. The obfuscation score is low (~0.2), reflecting suspicion due to the variable name but not indicating malicious intent. The security risk score is minimal (~0.1), considering the anomalies but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with minor anomalies such as an obfuscated variable name and a duplicate list entry. These do not constitute security risks or malicious behavior. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating no malware and a very low security threat.",
