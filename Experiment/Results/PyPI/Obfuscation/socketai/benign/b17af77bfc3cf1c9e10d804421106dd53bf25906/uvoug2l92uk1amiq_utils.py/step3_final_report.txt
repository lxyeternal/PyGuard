{
  "purpose": "The code performs data processing, likely involving environment variables, user input, or network interactions, but no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network responses, internal variables",
  "sinks": "File writes, network communication, environment variables",
  "flows": "Sources (env, input) to sinks (network, files, env) via data processing functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. It handles data in a typical manner, with no external data leaks or malicious network activity. The absence of obfuscation and malicious patterns supports a benign assessment. The risk scores reflect minimal external data handling potential, and malware scores are zero, consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low risk and malware scores are justified and align with the detailed descriptions. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
