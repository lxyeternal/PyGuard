{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module intended for general functionality without explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not read external data, user input, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that lead to data leaks, network communication, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow exists within the code; it mainly contains function definitions and control structures without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated sections are present. The code uses standard language features and libraries without unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows that the code consists of typical Python syntax, including function definitions, control flow, and standard library use. No signs of code injection, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors are present. The absence of external data handling, network calls, or file manipulations indicates low risk. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be benign and intended for legitimate purposes.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code exhibits no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a normal Python code snippet with no suspicious activity detected.",
