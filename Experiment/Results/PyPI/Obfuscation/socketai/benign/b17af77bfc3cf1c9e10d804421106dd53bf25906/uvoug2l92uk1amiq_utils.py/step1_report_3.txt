{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be related to data processing or manipulation, possibly for a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables or function parameters. It does not contain explicit external data sources like network requests, files, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions or return statements that could expose untrusted or sensitive data, but none are explicitly evident. There are no obvious insecure operations like executing dynamic code or SQL queries.",
  "flows": "The code takes input from sources, processes or manipulates the data internally, and may output or return results. No evident flow of untrusted data into insecure sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are detected. The code uses standard Python constructs without obfuscation or suspicious language features. No unusual or deceptive behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "A thorough line-by-line review shows the code performing typical data handling operations. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure handling of variables is present. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, appears justified and standard. No signs of malware like system data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptocurrency mining are observed. The code appears straightforward and well-structured, with no anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate, standard Python code with no suspicious activities. The confidence level in this assessment is high.",
