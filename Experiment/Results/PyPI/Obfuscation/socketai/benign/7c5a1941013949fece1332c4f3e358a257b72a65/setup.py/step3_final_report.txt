  "purpose": "Define setup configuration for neurolab, including metadata, version, description, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "Variables containing package info, the unused 'read' function, and the setup() call with metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; static metadata assignment.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of variables into setup() parameters; no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, unused 'read' function, a random string key in setup parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names and an unused function. No network activity, code execution, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for code hiding, but does not indicate malicious intent. The 'read' function is unused, which could be a remnant or obfuscation tactic. The package description is benign and related to neural networks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation and no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the package appears safe for use.",
