{
  "purpose": "The code constructs and trains a neural network model to approximate a sine wave function, then plots training error and network output against input data.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from numpy arrays (linspace, sin), and uses library functions from neurolab for network creation, training, and simulation.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the training error and network's predictions via plotting functions; no untrusted data or external outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Input data generated by numpy (linspace and sin) flows into neural network training, then network outputs are computed and plotted; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious control flows are present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard numpy functions to generate a sine wave dataset, constructs a feedforward neural network with neurolab, trains it over 500 epochs, and plots training error and the model's output. The code appears straightforward and consistent with common machine learning workflows. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected. The code does not process external untrusted data nor perform dangerous operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical example of neural network training for function approximation. It does not exhibit malicious intent, malware behavior, or security risks. The code is benign and related solely to neural network modeling and visualization.",
