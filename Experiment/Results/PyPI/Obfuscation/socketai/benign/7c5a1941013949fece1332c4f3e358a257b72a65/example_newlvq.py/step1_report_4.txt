  "purpose": "Example demonstration of using a LVQ (Learning Vector Quantization) neural network.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources, no external data reads observed in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present; the code appears to be a simple illustrative example without data processing pipelines.",
  "anomalies": "The code provided is only a comment header with no executable or functional code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are visible. The snippet lacks any runtime behavior or logic that could be malicious.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is purely a comment block describing an example of a LVQ network. There are no code statements, data processing, or external interactions. Without executable code, there is no apparent risk or malicious activity. The absence of actual implementation means no malicious patterns are present. Since the code is only documentation, it cannot perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely a comment header describing an example of a LVQ network. It contains no executable code or behavior that could be malicious or pose a security threat. Therefore, it is safe and has no security concerns.",
