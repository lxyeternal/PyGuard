  "purpose": "This code snippet is a comment/documentation string describing an LVQ network example.",
  "sources": "There are no sources of input or data; the snippet contains only a comment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; as there is no executable code, data flow or untrusted data handling is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the snippet is purely descriptive with no runtime execution.",
  "anomalies": "The code is just a comment with no executable content; no anomalies or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a non-executable comment describing an LVQ network example. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no suspicious or malicious code. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the content. The confidence scores are high (1), reflecting certainty that no malicious or risky behavior exists. The code poses no security threat or malicious intent, and the assessments are consistent and accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely a descriptive comment with no executable or malicious content. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No security risks, malware, or obfuscation are present.",
