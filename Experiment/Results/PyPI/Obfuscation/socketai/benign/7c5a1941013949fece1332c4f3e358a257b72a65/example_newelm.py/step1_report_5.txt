  "flows": "Synthetic data creation -> neural network training -> network output -> plotting of training error and network output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors observed. Data is synthetic, and no external data or network communication is present.",
  "analysis": "The code generates synthetic sine wave data and uses neurolab to create, initialize, and train a neural network with two layers. The training process runs for 500 epochs, with errors plotted at intervals. The output is visualized via matplotlib. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful commands. The use of synthetic data and standard plotting libraries indicates typical data analysis behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign example of neural network training with synthetic data, with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected.",
