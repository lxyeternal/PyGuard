{
  "purpose": "Train a neural network to learn the XOR function and plot training error over epochs.",
  "sources": "Imports neurolab library, defines input data, and loads training data.",
  "sinks": "Uses the neural network training function; no untrusted data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Input data is fed into the neural network training process; training error is plotted.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., ptZWpfrhJLbQRteAvfyZLEFvtUflmczH, guQQpnYQOcKGQUyenzdXUDlrHfXTPYgj) suggest code obfuscation but no malicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports neurolab, defines XOR input and output, creates a neural network, trains it for 100 epochs, and plots the training error. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the code structure is straightforward and consistent with standard neural network training. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are detected. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script trains a neural network on XOR data and visualizes the error; no malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation seems intended to hide variable names but does not indicate malware.",
