{
  "purpose": "Train a neural network (likely for XOR) using neurolab, visualize training error.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays, target labels, neural network creation, training function, plotting functions.",
  "sinks": "No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input data and targets fed into neural network training, training error output used for plotting.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no suspicious or malicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard neural network training for XOR data with visualization. No external communication, data leaks, or malicious operations are present. Obfuscation is evident but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.7, security risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No logical errors or security flaws are identified. The obfuscation does not imply malicious activity, and the code's purpose is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation likely for proprietary or concealment reasons. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",

  "obfuscated": 0.7,
