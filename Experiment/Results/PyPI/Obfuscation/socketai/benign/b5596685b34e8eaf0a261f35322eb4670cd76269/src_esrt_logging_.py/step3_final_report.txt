  "purpose": "Configure a styled logging setup using rich console output with obfuscated variable names and custom format strings.",
  "sources": "The logger name parameter, the logging configuration parameters, and the RichHandler setup.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or external data flows; the code does not process external input or output data externally.",
  "flows": "The input parameter is used solely as the logger name; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks that could cause vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through variable names, unusual format strings ('{', '%X.%f'), and non-standard configuration parameters. No external network activity or data exfiltration is present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logging configuration with obfuscated variable names and unusual format strings, primarily for styled console output via RichHandler. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or for concealment but does not constitute malicious behavior. The input parameter is used only as a logger name, not for processing untrusted data. The configuration is benign, with no vulnerabilities or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, heavily obfuscated logging setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent but warrants caution for maintainability. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscated score is approximately 0.75, and security risk score is low (~0.2).",
