{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports a specific function or object from a local handlers module and defines an __all__ list for exports.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .handlers import fMDLwwDBAtwlBuJAvGlYINUfHQCbyFKt",
  "sinks": "Potential usage of imported object if invoked elsewhere; no direct sinks in this fragment",
  "flows": "Import from handlers -> usage in other parts of the project (not shown here)",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'fMDLwwDBAtwlBuJAvGlYINUfHQCbyFKt' appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated identifier, which may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code itself is minimal and does not provide context, making it suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a possibly obfuscated or non-descriptive symbol from a local module, which could be used for malicious purposes if it performs harmful actions elsewhere. The __all__ list only exposes 'handle', but there's no evidence in this fragment that it links to the imported symbol. The code structure itself is simple, but the naming raises suspicion due to obfuscation. No other malicious patterns such as data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal but the use of an obfuscated import name suggests potential obfuscation or malicious intent. Without additional context, the code itself does not contain overt malicious behavior but warrants caution due to the suspicious naming.",
