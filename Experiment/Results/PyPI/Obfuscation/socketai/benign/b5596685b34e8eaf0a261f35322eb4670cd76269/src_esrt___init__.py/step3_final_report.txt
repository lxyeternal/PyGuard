  "purpose": "Minimal module importing an obfuscated symbol from a local handlers module and exposing 'handle' in __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .handlers module, reading the symbol fMDLwwDBAtwlBuJAvGlYINUfHQCbyFKt",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity present in this snippet",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbol from local module; no data flow beyond import and export",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated or auto-generated symbol name; __all__ includes 'handle' but 'handle' is not defined in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a single import of an obfuscated symbol and exposing 'handle' via __all__. The obfuscated name suggests potential concealment or auto-generation, which warrants suspicion but does not indicate malicious behavior by itself. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are evident. The scores assigned by reports reflect suspicion due to obfuscation but correctly note the lack of concrete malicious activity. The import name's obfuscation is a red flag that merits further investigation into the 'handlers' module. Overall, the code appears benign but suspicious due to naming; no active threats are demonstrated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in function but suspicious due to the obfuscated import name. No evidence of malicious behavior is present. The scores of low malware (0.2), high obfuscation (0.65), and moderate risk (0.2) are appropriate. Further review of the 'handlers' module is recommended to confirm the nature of the imported symbol.",
