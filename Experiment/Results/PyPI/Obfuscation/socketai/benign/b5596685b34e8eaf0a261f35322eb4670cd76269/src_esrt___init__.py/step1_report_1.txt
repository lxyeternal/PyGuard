  "purpose": "Exporting a specific handler function from a local module for external use.",

  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data processing or external communication in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import of 'fMDLwwDBAtwlBuJAvGlYINUfHQCbyFKt' from handlers module; no further data flow shown.",
  "anomalies": "Unusually named function 'fMDLwwDBAtwlBuJAvGlYINUfHQCbyFKt' suggests obfuscation or generated code, which could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a function with an obfuscated or auto-generated name, which raises suspicion about potential hidden behavior. The '__all__' list exposes only the 'handle' identifier, but it is not clear if 'handle' is directly linked to the imported function or if it is defined elsewhere. There are no other code constructs, data handling, or network interactions present. The lack of context prevents full understanding, but the obfuscated function name warrants cautious consideration.\n\nOverall, the code appears minimalistic, primarily for module exports, but the obfuscated function name is a potential indicator of malicious intent or at least obfuscation that could hide malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is simple and limited, exporting a handle for external use. The presence of an obfuscated function name in the import statement is suspicious and could be used to conceal malicious behavior or code injection. Without additional context or the implementation of 'fMDLwwDBAtwlBuJAvGlYINUfHQCbyFKt', further analysis is limited, but caution is advised due to obfuscation.",
