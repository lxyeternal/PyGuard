{
  "purpose": "The code exports a single function or object 'handle' for external use, likely part of a module interface.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.handlers', importing 'fMDLwwDBAtwlBuJAvGlYINUfHQCbyFKt'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only performs an import and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "Import flows from '.handlers' to the current module namespace; no data flow beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'fMDLwwDBAtwlBuJAvGlYINUfHQCbyFKt' appears as a random string, which could indicate obfuscation or concealment, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a standard import from a relative module and defining the __all__ list for export. The imported name appears to be a nonsensical string, which may be obfuscated or auto-generated. There are no suspicious data flows, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious code behavior evident. The presence of such a string alone does not imply malicious intent, but it warrants further review of the 'handlers' module to understand the nature of the imported symbol.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward, importing a symbol with an obfuscated name, and exposing 'handle' as part of its interface. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security issues in this snippet. The unusual import name might suggest obfuscation but is not inherently malicious. Further review of the imported symbol and the 'handlers' module is recommended for full context.",
