  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific Elasticsearch exception classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'elasticsearch.exceptions' and 'elasticsearch.helpers.errors'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code only imports and re-exports classes.",
  "flows": "Import of exception classes -> inclusion in __all__ list for export.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two exception classes from the Elasticsearch Python client library and re-exports them via the __all__ list. It performs no data processing, dynamic code execution, or external data handling. All reports confirm the code's benign nature, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent and justified given the simplicity and purpose of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign module used for re-exporting Elasticsearch exception classes. It poses no security threat, contains no malicious or obfuscated code, and the scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
