  "purpose": "Define and export specific exception classes from the Elasticsearch library for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements retrieving exception classes from external Elasticsearch modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code only imports and exports exception classes, no data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and export of exception classes. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two specific exception classes from the Elasticsearch client library: TransportError and BulkIndexError. It then defines an __all__ list to specify these classes for export. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden actions. The structure and syntax are standard for module exports in Python. The code relies entirely on external libraries, with no additional logic or data manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a simple module to re-export specific Elasticsearch exceptions for convenience. There are no indications of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. It is standard, safe, and does not pose any security threats.",
