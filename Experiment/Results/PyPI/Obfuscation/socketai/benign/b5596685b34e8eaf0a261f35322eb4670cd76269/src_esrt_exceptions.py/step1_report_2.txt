  "purpose": "Define and expose specific exception classes from the Elasticsearch Python client libraries.",
  "sources": "Import statements from elasticsearch.exceptions and elasticsearch.helpers.errors modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Importing exception classes and listing them in __all__ for module exports; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports two exception classes from the Elasticsearch client library and exposes them via __all__. There are no signs of malicious intent, no dynamic code execution, no data leaks, and no suspicious behaviors. The use of standard library imports and exports aligns with common Python practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward module that re-exports specific Elasticsearch exception classes, with no malicious behavior detected. It appears to be benign and intended for exception handling purposes.",
