  "purpose": "The code defines and exports specific exception classes from the Elasticsearch Python client library for handling transport and bulk index errors.",
  "sources": "Imports exception classes from the 'elasticsearch.exceptions' and 'elasticsearch.helpers.errors' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code only imports and re-exports classes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code merely imports and defines exported names.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exception classes from Elasticsearch client modules and defines an explicit export list. There are no indications of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated code. The imports are standard for handling Elasticsearch exceptions, and the re-exported names are directly related to error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward module for re-exporting specific Elasticsearch exception classes. There is no malicious intent, no anomalous behavior, and no security concerns identified.",
