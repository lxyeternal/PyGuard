  "purpose": "The code re-exports specific exception classes from the Elasticsearch Python client library for use elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'elasticsearch.exceptions' and 'elasticsearch.helpers.errors' modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; this is purely a module export of exception classes",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; standard re-export of imported exceptions",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exception classes from the Elasticsearch client library and exposes them via __all__ for external use. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and standard for module re-exports. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign module re-export of Elasticsearch exception classes with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
