  "purpose": "Define and export specific exception classes from the elasticsearch library for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements that bring in exception classes from external elasticsearch library modules.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external effects are evident in the code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks occurs within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or hardcoded secrets detected. The code is straightforward and follows standard practices for re-exporting exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific exception classes from the elasticsearch library and re-exports them via __all__. This allows other modules to import these exceptions directly from this module. The import statements are standard and do not involve any dynamic or malicious code execution. The __all__ list restricts exports to the specified exceptions, maintaining clean namespace management. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple and standard re-export of exception classes from the elasticsearch library. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a normal, benign module used for cleaner imports elsewhere.",
