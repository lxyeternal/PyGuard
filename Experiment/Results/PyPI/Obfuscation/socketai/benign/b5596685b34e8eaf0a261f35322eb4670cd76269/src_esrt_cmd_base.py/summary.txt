  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign CLI utility code with some obfuscation but no evidence of malicious payloads or supply chain compromise. The low malware and risk scores are justified. Continuous review of dependencies and external modules is recommended, but based on this analysis, the supply chain security posture is low risk."
