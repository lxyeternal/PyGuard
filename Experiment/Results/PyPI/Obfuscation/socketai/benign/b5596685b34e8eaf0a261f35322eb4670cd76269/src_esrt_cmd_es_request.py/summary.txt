  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit explicit malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The high obfuscation level and indirect method calls are suspicious but not definitive. The URL normalization bug should be fixed for correctness. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low (~0.2-0.4). Continuous review of the full codebase is recommended to ensure no malicious hidden behaviors are present."
