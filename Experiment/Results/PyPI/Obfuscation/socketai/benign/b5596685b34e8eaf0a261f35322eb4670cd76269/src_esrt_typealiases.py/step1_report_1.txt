{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for dictionaries with string keys and JsonValue values, and a literal type for HTTP methods.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines types and does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no data processing or I/O operations.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions using standard Python features and the 'pydantic' library's JsonValue. No input reading, data handling, or external communication occurs. Variable names are nonsensical but do not affect security. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely definitional, establishing type aliases for data structures and HTTP methods. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected based on the provided code snippet.",
