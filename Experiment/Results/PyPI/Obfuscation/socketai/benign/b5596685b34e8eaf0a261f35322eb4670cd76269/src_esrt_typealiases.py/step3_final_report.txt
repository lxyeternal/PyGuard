  "purpose": "Define type aliases for dictionaries mapping strings to JsonValue and a Literal for HTTP methods.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only static type alias definitions with no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, data processing, or external outputs.",
  "flows": "None; the code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that are nonsensical or auto-generated, but no malicious code or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions for two dictionaries and a Literal list of HTTP methods. No functions, data handling, or dynamic behavior are present. The variable names are obfuscated, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are detected. The malware score is 0, as there is no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), justified by the variable names, but not indicative of maliciousness. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static type alias declaration with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident. The high obfuscation is likely due to auto-generation or minimization, not malicious intent. The scores are consistent with this assessment.",
