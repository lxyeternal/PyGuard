{
  "purpose": "Define type aliases for dictionaries with string keys and JsonValue values, and a literal type for HTTP methods.",
  "sources": "Import statements for typing and pydantic.JsonValue",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing or untrusted input handling",
  "flows": "No data flow; definitions are static type aliases and literals",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear obfuscated, with no clear purpose; no usage or behavior beyond type annotations",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for type hinting and pydantic's JsonValue. It then defines two dictionaries with obscure variable names, both mapping strings to JsonValue, and a Literal for common HTTP methods. No data is read or processed; no dynamic code or input handling is present. Variable names seem intentionally obfuscated, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation techniques such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be simply setting up type aliases for later use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static type alias definitions with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious data flow, and no evident security risks.",
