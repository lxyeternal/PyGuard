{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, reading README.md for long description.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external data sinks; only local file read.",
  "flows": "From reading 'README.md' into a variable to passing it as the long description in setup.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical variable names; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script for packaging a Python module. It reads a local README file and supplies static metadata to setuptools.setup(). No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Variable obfuscation appears stylistic, not malicious. All indicators point to benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package setup script with obfuscated variable names that do not imply malicious intent. No malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or security risks are detected.",
