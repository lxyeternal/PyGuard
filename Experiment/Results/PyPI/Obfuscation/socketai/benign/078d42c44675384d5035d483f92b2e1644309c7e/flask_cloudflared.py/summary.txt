  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors that could be legitimate for setting up secure tunnels but also employs obfuscation, stealth, and external binary execution that raise suspicion of malicious intent. Without additional verification or context, it should be considered potentially malicious with a moderate to high security risk."
