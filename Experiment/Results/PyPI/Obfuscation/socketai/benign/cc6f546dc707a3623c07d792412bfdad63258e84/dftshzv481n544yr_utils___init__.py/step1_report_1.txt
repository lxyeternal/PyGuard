{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module intended for general functionality. There is no clear indication of malicious intent from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the environment variables, user input, or external files (if any). However, no explicit sources of input are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be system calls, network connections, or data writes, but none are explicitly present in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is apparent in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated segments, or suspicious patterns are detected in the snippet. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "A thorough line-by-line review shows standard Python syntax and structure. Usage of third-party libraries or environment variables does not appear suspicious. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection are visible. The code follows typical patterns without anomalies or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and standard. However, without additional context or the full code, confidence remains moderate.",
