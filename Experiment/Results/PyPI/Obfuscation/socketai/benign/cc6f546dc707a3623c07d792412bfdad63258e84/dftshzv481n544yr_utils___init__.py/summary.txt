  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with reports 2 and 4 showing obfuscation and suspicious patterns that justify moderate malware and risk scores. Slightly increasing the malware score for report 2 improves alignment with the suspicion level. Overall, the assessments are consistent and cautious, emphasizing the need for further review if code details are available."
