{
  "purpose": "Define multiple regular expression patterns for pattern matching various data formats such as IDs, dates, IP addresses, and other strings.",
  "sources": "No data input or data reading functions; patterns are assigned to variables directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output functions; code only defines regex patterns without processing data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing flows; variables are assigned regex patterns but not used in further operations.",
  "anomalies": "Patterns include sensitive data formats like IP addresses, dates, and IDs, but no actual data handling or suspicious activity observed. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple regex pattern definitions aimed at matching specific data formats. Patterns are straightforward and use common regex syntax; no obfuscated code or suspicious constructs. No functions, no data processing, and no network or file operations are present. The variables are simply assigned pattern strings, indicating the code is likely intended for pattern matching elsewhere. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious code insertion within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines regex patterns for various data formats and does not perform any malicious activity or suspicious operations. It appears to be benign, possibly part of a larger data validation or parsing module.",
