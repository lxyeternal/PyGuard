{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a set of string patterns, likely for use in regex matching, potentially for data validation or extraction tasks.",
  "sources": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with regex pattern strings; there are no input sources such as user input, files, or network data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; it does not process untrusted data or perform actions such as system calls, network connections, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns regex patterns to variables without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are assigned regex pattern strings; no anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code behaviors are evident. Patterns are standard regex syntax without obfuscation or hidden payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains variable assignments with regex patterns that match various data formats (e.g., phone numbers, IP addresses, dates). No input handling, data processing, or malicious behavior is present. The patterns are straightforward, suggesting typical use for data validation or parsing. There is no evidence of code injection, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The absence of functions, control flow, or external system interactions reduces suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and appears to be part of a larger validation or parsing utility. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a set of regex pattern definitions without any suspicious or harmful elements.",
