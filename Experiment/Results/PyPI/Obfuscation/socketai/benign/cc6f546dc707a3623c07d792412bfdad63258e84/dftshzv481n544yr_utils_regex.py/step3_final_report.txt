  "purpose": "Variable assignments of regex pattern strings for data validation and parsing.",
  "sources": "None; patterns are defined as string variables with no input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "None; patterns are standalone definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names vary from descriptive to obfuscated; patterns are straightforward regex.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of regex pattern string assignments, with no input handling, data processing, or external system interactions. Patterns match common data formats such as dates, IP addresses, phone numbers, etc. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious constructs are evident. Variable naming is sometimes complex but not malicious. The regex patterns are standard and benign, serving likely for validation or parsing purposes. No hardcoded secrets, payloads, or malicious behaviors are present. The overall structure indicates a benign utility module defining regex patterns without execution or data flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of regex pattern definitions for data validation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, obfuscation beyond variable naming, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, obfuscated=0.2–0.4, securityRisk=0.0–0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
