  "conclusion": "The code contains a critical security vulnerability through the unsafe execution of untrusted commands via 'os.system'. While no direct evidence of malicious payloads exists, the potential for exploitation is high. Obfuscation adds suspicion but is not definitive proof of malicious intent. The overall security risk is severe, and the code should be refactored to sanitize inputs or avoid executing raw commands. The current scores should reflect high malware and risk levels, with moderate obfuscation suspicion."
