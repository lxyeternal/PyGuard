  "conclusion": "The code is a benign timing utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation is likely for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware = 0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
