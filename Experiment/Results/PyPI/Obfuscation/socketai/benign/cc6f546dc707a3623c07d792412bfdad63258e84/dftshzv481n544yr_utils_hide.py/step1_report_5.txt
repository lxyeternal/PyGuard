  "purpose": "Generate an SQL query to retrieve column information from a database table, based on input parameter.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'OdFmSsmmLCkhzprrPtnHWPFPhXTwcUUP' which is used directly in the SQL string.",
  "sinks": "The constructed SQL query string that includes untrusted input, which could be executed in a database context.",
  "flows": "Input parameter -> String formatting into SQL query -> SQL execution (implied, not shown in code).",
  "anomalies": "The input parameter is directly interpolated into an SQL statement without sanitization or parameterization, indicating potential SQL injection risk.",
  "analysis": "The function accepts an argument and embeds it directly into an SQL query string. The parameter is used as a value in the WHERE clause, which if untrusted, can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. No validation, sanitization, or parameterization is performed, increasing risk. The code appears to be part of a database querying process, but the lack of input handling is suspicious. The function’s purpose is straightforward, but the method of string formatting introduces security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code has a significant SQL injection vulnerability due to unsanitized input being embedded directly into the query string. This could allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL command. No malicious behavior beyond the security risk is evident, but the insecure coding practice is concerning.",
