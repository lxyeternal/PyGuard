{
  "purpose": "The function constructs an SQL query to retrieve metadata about table columns from INFORMATION_SCHEMA based on the provided table name.",
  "sources": "The function takes input via the parameter OdFmSsmmLCkhzprrPtnHWPFPhXTwcUUP, which is used directly in the SQL query.",
  "sinks": "The SQL query is executed with user-controlled input directly embedded, making it a potential sink if the input is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input (table name) flows directly into the SQL query string, which is then presumably executed against a database.",
  "anomalies": "The input is directly interpolated into the SQL string without sanitization or parameterization, raising SQL injection concerns. No other anomalies are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that creates an SQL query string to retrieve column metadata from the INFORMATION_SCHEMA database. The input parameter is directly embedded into the query string without sanitization or prepared statements, which poses a significant risk of SQL injection if the input is untrusted. There are no indications of obfuscation or malicious code within the snippet. The code appears to be a straightforward data retrieval function, but the insecure handling of user input constitutes a security vulnerability.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior per se, but it is insecure due to the lack of input validation or parameterization, exposing it to SQL injection attacks if the input is untrusted. It should be modified to use parameterized queries for safety.",
