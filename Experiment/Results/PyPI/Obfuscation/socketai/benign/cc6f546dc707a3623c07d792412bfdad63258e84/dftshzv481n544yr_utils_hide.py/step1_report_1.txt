  "purpose": "The function constructs an SQL query to retrieve column information from a database schema based on the input parameter.",
  "sources": "Input parameter: OdFmSsmmLCkhzprrPtnHWPFPhXTwcUUP",
  "sinks": "SQL query execution that may involve untrusted input leading to SQL injection if the query is executed directly with this string.",
  "flows": "Input parameter -> SQL query string with embedded parameter -> potential execution of this query on a database",
  "anomalies": "The code directly interpolates user input into an SQL query string without sanitization or parameterization, which is a common SQL injection risk. No other anomalies or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The function takes an input string and incorporates it directly into an SQL statement. There are no validations or sanitizations performed, making it vulnerable to SQL injection if this query is executed without proper parameter handling. The code appears to be a straightforward query constructor, but the direct string interpolation is a security concern. No malicious or backdoor code is detected; the risk is solely due to unsafe SQL practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code constructs an SQL query with user input embedded directly into the string, posing a significant SQL injection risk if executed as-is. No malware or malicious behavior is explicitly present, but insecure query construction makes it vulnerable to exploitation.",
