  "conclusion": "The code is insecure due to unsafe string interpolation, leading to high potential for SQL injection. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk score should be increased to approximately 0.75 for better alignment with the vulnerability severity. Proper mitigation involves using parameterized queries or input sanitization."
