  "purpose": "Constructs an SQL query string to retrieve column metadata from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS based on user input.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'OdFmSsmmLCkhzprrPtnHWPFPhXTwcUUP' used directly in string interpolation.",
  "sinks": "The returned SQL query string, which could be executed in a database context, leading to potential injection if untrusted input is used.",
  "flows": "Input parameter -> string interpolation -> constructed SQL query string -> potential execution point (not shown in code).",
  "anomalies": "No sanitization or parameterization; straightforward string interpolation; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs an SQL query by directly embedding user input without sanitization, creating a high risk of SQL injection if the query is executed with untrusted data. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The security risk is significant due to the potential for data leaks or manipulation if exploited. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The security risk score should be high (~0.75) to reflect the severity of SQL injection vulnerability, especially if the query is executed directly with untrusted input. The reports correctly identify the core issue; minor score adjustments for consistency are recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code is insecure due to unsafe string interpolation, leading to high potential for SQL injection. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk score should be increased to approximately 0.75 for better alignment with the vulnerability severity. Proper mitigation involves using parameterized queries or input sanitization.",
