  "purpose": "Constructs an SQL query to retrieve column information from the database schema for a given table name.",
  "sources": "Input parameter OdFmSsmmLCkhzprrPtnHWPFPhXTwcUUP, which is used directly in the SQL query string.",
  "sinks": "The SQL query execution context where the input is embedded directly into the query string, potentially leading to SQL injection if the input is untrusted.",
  "flows": "User-controlled input (OdFmSsmmLCkhzprrPtnHWPFPhXTwcUUP) flows directly into the SQL query string, which could be executed against the database.",
  "anomalies": "The function concatenates user input directly into an SQL query without sanitization or parameterization, creating a risk of SQL injection. No other suspicious code or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes an input parameter intended to be a table name. It constructs an SQL query string by embedding this input directly, without any sanitization, escaping, or use of parameterized queries. This pattern is a common vector for SQL injection attacks if the input is from an untrusted source. There are no indications of obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or other malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration or system compromise. The function’s purpose appears to be schema inspection based on user input, which, if not properly protected, could be exploited.\n\nOverall, the code is straightforward, with a significant security concern due to unsanitized string concatenation into an SQL query, but it does not contain malicious code itself or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code constructs an SQL query by concatenating user input directly, which poses a potential SQL injection risk. No malicious behavior is evident beyond this security concern. The function's intent seems benign but insecurely implemented if used with untrusted input.",
