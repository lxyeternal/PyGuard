{
  "purpose": "The function constructs an SQL query to retrieve metadata about columns in a specified table from INFORMATION_SCHEMA.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'OdFmSsmmLCkhzprrPtnHWPFPhXTwcUUP', which is used directly in the SQL query string.",
  "sinks": "The constructed SQL query string, which is returned but not executed within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Input parameter -> SQL query string construction -> return query string.",
  "anomalies": "The input parameter is directly interpolated into the SQL string without sanitization or parameterization, indicating potential for SQL injection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that takes a single parameter and incorporates it directly into an SQL query string without any validation or sanitization. This pattern is vulnerable to SQL injection if the input is untrusted, as malicious payloads could be passed to manipulate the query. There are no other suspicious behaviors, backdoors, or malicious code evident. The code's primary concern is its unsafe handling of user input in the SQL context, which can lead to data leaks or unauthorized data access if exploited.\n\nNo other signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or malware are present. The code is simple and appears to be part of a larger database querying system.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code constructs an SQL query by directly interpolating user input without sanitization, posing a significant SQL injection risk. It does not exhibit malware or obfuscation but should be reviewed for safe parameter handling to prevent security vulnerabilities.",
