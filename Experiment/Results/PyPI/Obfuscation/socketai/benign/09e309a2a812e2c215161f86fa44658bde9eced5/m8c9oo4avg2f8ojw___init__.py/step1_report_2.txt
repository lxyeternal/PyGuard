  "purpose": "The code defines a string variable indicating a version number, likely for a package or module.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string data assigned to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points to untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure, but it is just a long, nonsensical identifier. No other unusual code or behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement for future compatibility features and a single string variable assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external input handling, no network activity, and no suspicious code structures. The obfuscated-looking variable name does not indicate malicious intent but may be an attempt to hide or obscure purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of a simple version string assignment. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
