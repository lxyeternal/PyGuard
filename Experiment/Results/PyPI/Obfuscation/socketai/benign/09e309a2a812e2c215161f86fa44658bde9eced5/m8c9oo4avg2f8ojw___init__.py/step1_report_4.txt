{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string for a Python module or package.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only assigns a string value to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no functions or operations that process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident since the code only contains a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name is an obfuscated or nonsensical string, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The version string '0.9.4' is typical for a package or module.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then assigns a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no inputs, outputs, network calls, or other operations. The obfuscated variable name may suggest an attempt to hide the purpose, but without further context, it seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simple and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated variable name, which does not indicate malicious intent but may hinder readability.",
