  "purpose": "Define a version string for a Python module or script.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '0.9.4' to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated-like variable name; minimal code; no external input handling; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility and assigns a version string to a variable with a complex, non-descriptive name. There are no data inputs, no processing, no network calls, or other suspicious activity. The variable name appears intentionally obscure but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware, obfuscation beyond variable naming, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious behavior or security risks are present based on this fragment.",
