  "purpose": "Define a version string, possibly for a package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string to a variable, no input reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable name; the string appears to be a version number.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then assigns a version string to a variable with a non-standard, obfuscated name. There is no evidence of input reading, data leakage, malicious payload, or suspicious behavior. The variable name does not follow typical naming conventions and may be intended to obscure purpose, but it alone does not indicate malicious intent. No other code is present to evaluate further.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple version assignment with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated variable name may be a minor attempt at hiding intent but does not constitute malware or security risk.",
