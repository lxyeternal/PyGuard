{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string '0.9.4' to an obfuscated variable name, likely for internal version tracking.",
  "sources": "The variable assignment statement; no external input or data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, no data leaks, no external sinks or network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A; simple assignment with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated variable name without descriptive context; no malicious code or suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility and assigns a version string to an obscure variable name. There are no inputs, outputs, network calls, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with low malware and security risk scores. The obfuscation score is justified by the nonsensical variable name, but no active malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version string assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There is no malicious activity or security threat present. The high obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
