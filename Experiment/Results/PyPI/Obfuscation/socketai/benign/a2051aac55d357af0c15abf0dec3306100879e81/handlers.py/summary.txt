  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate scientific data processing routines with obfuscation that could be for concealment or proprietary reasons. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and low security risk score (~0.2) are justified. Obfuscation is notable but does not, on its own, indicate malicious intent."
