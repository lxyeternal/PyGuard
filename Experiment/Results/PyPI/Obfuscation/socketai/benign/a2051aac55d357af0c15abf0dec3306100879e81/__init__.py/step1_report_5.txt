  "purpose": "Retrieve version information from a private module and define a context manager class with no active functionality.",
  "sources": "Importing from ._version module, calling its function to get version; class definition with no input reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Retrieving version info from the module; no flow involving untrusted data or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and class names; importing and invoking a version function, possibly to hide intent. No visible malicious activity, but naming conventions and obfuscation suggest suspicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version value from a local module, assigns it to a variable, then deletes the reference, which may be an obfuscation tactic. It also defines a context manager class with empty methods, possibly a placeholder or a deliberate attempt to obscure behavior. There are no apparent data leaks, external communications, or malicious code. The obfuscated variable names and import structure raise suspicion, but no definitive malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears primarily obfuscated, with no clear malicious intent or malicious code present. It may be intended to conceal functionality or distract reviewers. No malware or security risks are directly observable, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
