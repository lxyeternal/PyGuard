{
  "purpose": "Retrieve version information from a private module and define an inert, obfuscated context manager class.",
  "sources": "Import from ._version module, calling a function to get version, variable assignment, class definition with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import -> function call -> variable assignment -> class definition (no data flow beyond structure).",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and class names, minimal implementation, no functional logic, no side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a private module, retrieves and deletes the reference, then defines a class with context management methods that do nothing. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal simplicity, but no malicious behavior, data leaks, or external communications are evident. The class is inert, serving perhaps as a placeholder or for obfuscation. The overall structure is benign, with no active security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated, minimal module fragment that retrieves version info and defines an inert context manager class. No malicious activity or security threats are present based on this fragment. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not currently indicate malicious intent.",
