  "anomalies": "The JSON string contains version metadata but no apparent malicious content. No unusual code or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a JSON string with version info, then provides a function that loads and returns this data. The JSON content is static and does not include any external input, commands, or code execution. There are no suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or embedded malicious payloads. The function is straightforward, performing standard JSON parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign operation of loading static JSON data. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
