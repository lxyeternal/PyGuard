  "purpose": "The code defines a JSON string with version information and a function to parse and return this JSON data.",
  "sources": "The JSON string RkpleqNOnDWjNRDspcuubXkEneNfILXQ is read when json.loads() is called within the function.",
  "sinks": "json.loads() processes untrusted JSON data; if the JSON string were externally supplied, this could be a data input point, but here it is hardcoded.",
  "flows": "The function loads the JSON string into a Python object, serving as a simple data retrieval flow.",
  "anomalies": "The JSON string is hardcoded and static, with no dynamic input or external data fetching. The code does not perform any network operations, file access, or execute external code. The function is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static JSON string containing version metadata and a function that parses this string into a Python dictionary. No untrusted input, external data, or dynamic behavior is involved. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears benign and serves solely to provide version information.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It simply loads a predefined JSON string. There are no anomalies or suspicious behavior.",
