  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose discernible from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input sources such as files or user input (e.g., via open() or input()), environment variables, or network sockets if present.",
  "sinks": "Writes data to files, network connections, or outputs such as print() statements, or executes system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions and then to output sinks; specific flow paths depend on data handling code, which appears standard.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, following typical Python programming practices. No malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. It does not include suspicious network connections, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Use of third-party libraries is normal and justified. There are no signs of obfuscated code or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility or data processing script with standard practices. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
