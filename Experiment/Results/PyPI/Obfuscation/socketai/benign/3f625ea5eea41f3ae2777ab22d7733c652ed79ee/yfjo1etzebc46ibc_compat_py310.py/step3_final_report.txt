  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input reading functions (e.g., input(), environment variables, file reads), network requests, dynamic code execution (eval()/exec()), hardcoded credentials/URLs, untrusted data flows.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (data exfiltration), system calls with untrusted data, eval()/exec() with untrusted input, file writes/read, subprocess calls.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user input, environment variables, files) passing through eval()/exec(), network requests, or system calls, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded credentials, URLs/IPs, use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, obfuscated code segments, dynamic code generation, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors such as hardcoded secrets, dynamic code execution, and network activity, indicating high malicious potential. Absence of such patterns suggests benign intent. Suspicious behaviors are well-supported by described indicators, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Lack of code or benign descriptions warrant low scores. The assessment aligns with the signals, with high confidence in suspicious code and low confidence in benign or absent code.",
  "conclusion": "Report 4 indicates high malicious activity with justified high malware, obfuscation, and risk scores. Other reports show no evidence of malicious behavior, with scores reflecting benign or unknown status. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the described behaviors and analysis.",
