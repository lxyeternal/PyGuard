  "purpose": "This code defines a decorator that wraps a method to save its arguments as an attribute on the class instance.",
  "sources": "Function arguments (positional and keyword) captured within the wrapper function",
  "sinks": "Setting an attribute on the instance with the captured arguments",
  "flows": "Arguments -> Wrapper function -> Save to instance attribute -> Original method call",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamically generated attribute name with a prefix '_saved_'; no external data input sources; no code execution or external communication observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator 'ZHEFNgxomMYNhmUroKzCryCAvSUXGLba' that wraps a method. Inside the wrapper, it creates a namedtuple to store the method's arguments, then assigns this stored arguments object to an attribute on the class instance, with a name based on the method name. It then calls the original method with the same arguments. No external data inputs, no network calls, no file I/O, and no code injection are present. The attribute name is dynamically generated but static in pattern. This pattern is consistent with argument logging or state saving, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign decorator that stores method arguments for potential later retrieval or debugging. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malware. The code appears to be for internal debugging or state management without harmful intent.",
