  "purpose": "Decorator that captures method arguments and stores them as an attribute on the class instance for debugging or state tracking.",
  "sources": "Method input arguments (positional and keyword arguments).",
  "sinks": "Stored attribute on the class instance; no external data flows or external communication.",
  "flows": "Arguments are captured into a namedtuple and assigned to an attribute, then the original method is called with the same arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and dynamic attribute naming; no validation or security checks on stored data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator that wraps a method, creating a namedtuple of all arguments and storing it as an attribute on the object. It then calls the original method. No external I/O, network activity, code injection, or malicious operations are present. Obfuscated variable names could be suspicious but are likely stylistic or internal. The pattern resembles argument logging or internal state preservation, common in debugging. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection are observed. The scores assigned in the critical reports (malware: 0, risk: ~0.1, obfuscation: moderate) are consistent with this benign interpretation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign argument-logging decorator with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores are appropriate; malware score should remain at 0, and obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern.",
