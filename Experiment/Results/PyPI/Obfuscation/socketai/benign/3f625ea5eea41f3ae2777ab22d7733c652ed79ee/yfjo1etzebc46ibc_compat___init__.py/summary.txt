  "conclusion": "All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious or suspicious activity, with scores that are consistent and justified. Given the absence of code or anomalies, the supply chain security risk is minimal. Slight adjustments to risk scores could be made to reflect the high confidence in benign status, but current scores are acceptable."
