{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs data processing or communication, but the specific purpose cannot be definitively determined without further context.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, user input, or external files; possibly from network connections or command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to files, console, or network destinations; writes to environment variables or system resources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks such as files or network transmissions, potentially passing through transformation or processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies; however, if the code uses eval, exec, or dynamic imports without validation, that could be suspicious. Hardcoded credentials or URLs, if present, would be notable. Unusual import patterns or obfuscated code segments would also be red flags.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for typical malicious indicators such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity. It does not contain explicit hardcoded credentials or suspicious network calls. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious dynamic code execution, or hidden payloads. Usage of standard libraries appears benign. Without seeing external inputs or runtime behavior, the risk level remains low. The code structure suggests it is a straightforward script with no evident malicious intent or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static analysis, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet. It appears to be a benign utility or processing script. However, without dynamic context or runtime data, this assessment cannot be definitive.",
