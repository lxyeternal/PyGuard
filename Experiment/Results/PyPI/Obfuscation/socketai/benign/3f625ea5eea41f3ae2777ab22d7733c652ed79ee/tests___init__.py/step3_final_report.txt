  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec(), environment variables, subprocess/system calls, input/output data flows.",
  "sinks": "Execution functions, network connections, data leaks, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input passed to eval()/exec() or subprocess leading to potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, dynamic code execution, obfuscated variable names, risky system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code contains no content in some reports, indicating no risk. Benign scripts show standard data processing with no suspicious patterns, matching low malware and risk scores. The presence of eval()/exec() and subprocess calls in one report indicates moderate suspicion, justifying higher malware (0.4) and risk (0.55) scores. No obfuscation or hardcoded secrets are detected. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors and potential risks.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign or empty, with appropriate low scores. The report with eval()/exec() demonstrates moderate malicious potential, justified by the risky functions used. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
