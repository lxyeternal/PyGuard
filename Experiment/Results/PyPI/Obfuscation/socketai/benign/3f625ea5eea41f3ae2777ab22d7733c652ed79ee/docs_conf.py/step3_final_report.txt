  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation extensions and URL templates, with no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings, extension lists, regex patterns, URL templates, and static dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "None; all data is static and does not process untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration data remains isolated.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious behavior or code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static lists, dictionaries, and string templates used for documentation configuration. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. Obfuscated variable names are noted but appear stylistic rather than malicious. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation does not correlate with malicious intent given the static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration script for Sphinx documentation, with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
