  "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as a pattern translation utility with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are detected. The obfuscation is likely for code concealment or auto-generation but does not imply malicious intent. Scores are adjusted to reflect the benign nature, with malware risk at 0.0, obfuscation high at 0.7, and overall security risk low at 0.2."
