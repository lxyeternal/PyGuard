  "purpose": "Pattern translation utility converting glob-like patterns into regex patterns for filename or path matching.",
  "sources": "Input patterns provided to translate_core and translate methods.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external system effects present.",
  "flows": "Input pattern -> translate_core -> extend -> match_dirs/separate (external functions) -> regex pattern",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via variable names and verbose, nonsensical comments; external functions 'match_dirs' and 'separate' are referenced but not provided.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for translating glob-like patterns into regex patterns, with heavily obfuscated variable names and detailed docstrings containing examples. No system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are evident. External functions are referenced but not included, limiting full context. The pattern translation appears benign, serving as a utility within larger codebases. Obfuscation is notable but does not directly indicate malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The security risk score is low, reflecting the benign nature of pattern translation. The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming and comments. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate utility, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as a pattern translation utility with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are detected. The obfuscation is likely for code concealment or auto-generation but does not imply malicious intent. Scores are adjusted to reflect the benign nature, with malware risk at 0.0, obfuscation high at 0.7, and overall security risk low at 0.2.",
