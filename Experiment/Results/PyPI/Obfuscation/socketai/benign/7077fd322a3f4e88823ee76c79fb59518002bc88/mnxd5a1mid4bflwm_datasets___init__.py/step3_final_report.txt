  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, environment variables, network operations, file handling, and external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, and system modifications.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, indicating potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or suspicious imports; absence of code or missing code segments are noted as uncertainties.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no suspicious imports, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. Confidence levels are appropriately assigned based on the amount of code and context. Security risk scores are low (0.2 or 0), aligning with the lack of malicious indicators. Malware scores are consistently zero, reflecting no evidence of malicious intent. The reports with missing code appropriately reflect uncertainty with low confidence scores. Overall, the assessments are cautious, consistent, and justified given the provided data.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and summaries across all reports show no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the observations. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture is benign based on current information.",
