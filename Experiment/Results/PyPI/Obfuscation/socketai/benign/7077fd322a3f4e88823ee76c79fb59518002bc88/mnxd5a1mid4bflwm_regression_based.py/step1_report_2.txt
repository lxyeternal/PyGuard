{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom subclasses of sklearn's Ridge regression and LinearSVR models, adding methods for customized training, prediction, and error calculation, potentially for machine learning purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data through the methods LCrSRIQttOITZHnfWhiGIoyjrZXzjjZl and aXVtWpGpCYXmqjhmuGjbpEfTSgCprosQ, which take feature matrices and target vectors as parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code performs calculations on the input data, such as rounding, clipping, and error metrics, but no untrusted data is directly used in sensitive operations like system commands, network access, or file handling.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the parameters of the model methods into data processing steps (np.unique, np.round, np.clip, metrics functions), with no apparent connection to external systems or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The class and method names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which can be suspicious. The code performs no logging, no network activity, and no file operations. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The complexity appears unnecessary but benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily extends sklearn models with custom methods that modify data internally (e.g., obtaining unique values, rounding predictions, clipping predictions). These modifications seem to serve model-specific purposes. The code uses numpy and sklearn metrics, both standard libraries, with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscated class and method names could suggest concealment, but no malicious actions are evident. The code does not perform any external communications, data exfiltration, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated yet benign extension of standard sklearn regression models. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation could be intentional to hinder readability, but functionality is consistent with normal machine learning workflows.",
