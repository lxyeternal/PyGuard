{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom wrapper classes around scikit-learn's Ridge regression and LinearSVR models, adding custom methods and modifications for data processing and error calculation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input variables passed to the methods, particularly in fit and prediction methods of the classes.",
  "sinks": "Potential data processing points include numpy operations, model fitting, and error calculations. No explicit untrusted data output or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from method parameters into model training and prediction, with no external network or file outputs; error calculations are internal.",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which may indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent. The code uses numpy rounding and clipping, which could be benign, but the naming is suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code redefines regression models with non-standard class and method names, possibly to obfuscate. It adds unique y-value storage and overrides methods for fitting and prediction, applying rounding and clipping operations. These modifications do not inherently indicate malicious behavior but suggest attempts to obscure code intent. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications are present. The obfuscated names and structure could be attempts to hide malicious intent, but the code appears to be a benign wrapper around standard scikit-learn models.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily consists of obfuscated wrappers around existing regression models with no clear malicious activity. The obfuscation and unconventional naming could be suspicious but do not constitute malware or significant security risks based on this fragment alone.",
