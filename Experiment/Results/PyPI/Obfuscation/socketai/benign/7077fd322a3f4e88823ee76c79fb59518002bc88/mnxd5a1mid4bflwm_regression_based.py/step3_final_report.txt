{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated subclasses of sklearn's Ridge and LinearSVR models with custom fit and predict methods, likely for model customization or concealment.",
  "sources": "Data inputs to fit and predict methods, including feature matrices and label vectors.",
  "sinks": "Return statements and internal computations; no external data exfiltration or network operations detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into fit/predict methods, undergo transformations (e.g., rounding, clipping), then outputs are generated; no external sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation in class and method names; prediction outputs are clipped and predictions are rounded, setting epsilon to zero in one subclass, which could manipulate model outputs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses that override standard sklearn model methods, adding data processing steps such as np.round and np.clip, and storing unique label values. The obfuscation via non-descriptive class and method names suggests concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present. The modifications (clipping predictions, setting epsilon to zero) could be benign model tuning or potentially used to distort outputs. The obfuscation and prediction manipulation warrant cautious interpretation but do not constitute active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated wrappers around standard sklearn models, with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation and prediction modifications could be used to conceal or manipulate model outputs but are not inherently malicious. A low malware likelihood is justified, with a slight caution due to obfuscation and output manipulation potential.",
