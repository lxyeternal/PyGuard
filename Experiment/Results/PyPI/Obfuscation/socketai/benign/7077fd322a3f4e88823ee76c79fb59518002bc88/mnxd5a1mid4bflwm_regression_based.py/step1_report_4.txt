{
  "purpose": "Custom extensions of Ridge and LinearSVR models to include additional processing, such as extracting unique labels and custom error metrics.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function arguments (training features, target labels).",
  "sinks": "The models produce predictions and error calculations but do not send data elsewhere or perform external network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arguments into model training or prediction functions, with predictions then used in error calculations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains unusually named methods and variables; the class names and method names appear intentionally obfuscated, which is atypical for standard library extension code. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation techniques like eval or exec are used.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses of sklearn models with overridden methods that manipulate input data and predictions. Specifically, it calculates unique labels during training, rounds predictions, clips predictions to label range, and computes error metrics. The obfuscation of class and method names suggests an attempt to conceal purpose, but the logic itself is consistent with model customization. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors identified. The code does not interact with environment variables, filesystem, or external systems. No suspicious code patterns or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate extensions of machine learning models with intentionally obfuscated naming. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation might hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code poses no security risks based on its content.",
