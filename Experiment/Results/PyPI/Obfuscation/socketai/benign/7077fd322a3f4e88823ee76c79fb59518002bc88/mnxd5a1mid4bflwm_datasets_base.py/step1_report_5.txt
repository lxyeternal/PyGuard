{
  "purpose": "The code appears to load and process housing survey data, including reading CSV and text files, and returning processed data in a structured format.",
  "sources": "Reading file paths using __file__, reading CSV file 'copenhagen_housing_survey.csv', reading text file 'copenhagen_housing_survey.rst', and accessing DataFrame columns.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points are reading files without validation and accessing DataFrame columns. No direct data leakage or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "File path constructions lead to reading CSV and text files; CSV data is expanded via 'Freq' column; processed data is returned in a Bunch object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive function name; reading a .rst file as if it were data, which is unusual; the code repeats rows based on 'Freq' values, which could be suspicious if data sources are untrusted. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script dynamically constructs file paths relative to the script's location, reads a CSV and a text file, and processes the CSV data by expanding rows based on 'Freq' column. It packages specific columns into a Bunch object for further use. There are no signs of malicious network activity, code obfuscation, or backdoors. The reading of a .rst file as data is unusual but not malicious. The overall structure indicates data processing for analysis or modeling. No evidence of malware or malicious intent found.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs data loading and preprocessing without suspicious behavior or malicious intent. It contains some unconventional elements, such as reading a .rst file as data, but these are not inherently malicious. Overall security risk is low.",
