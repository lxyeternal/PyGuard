{
  "purpose": "The code loads and processes housing survey data, reading files from disk, manipulating data with pandas and numpy, and returning structured data.",
  "sources": "Reads file paths based on __file__, reads text file 'copenhagen_housing_survey.rst', reads CSV 'copenhagen_housing_survey.csv', and reads data from pandas DataFrame.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations; data returned in a structured object; no external network, system commands, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "File path construction -> File reading (rst and csv) -> DataFrame expansion using 'Freq' column -> Data returned in structured format.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; function and variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, no unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary libraries, constructs file paths relative to the script location, reads a text and CSV file, expands the DataFrame based on the 'Freq' column, and returns selected columns in a structured object. The code appears to be a typical data loading and preprocessing routine. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, data exfiltration, or code injection are evident. Obfuscation of function and variable names may suggest intent to conceal, but it does not necessarily imply malicious behavior. The code does not perform network operations, system modifications, or sensitive data handling beyond local file access.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data loading script with obfuscated names but no malicious or security-threatening behavior detected. It is likely part of a data processing pipeline with no evident supply chain risks.",
