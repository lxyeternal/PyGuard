{
  "purpose": "The code loads a text file and a CSV dataset from directories relative to the script, expands the dataset based on a 'Freq' column, and returns a structured object with selected columns.",
  "sources": "Reading a '.rst' file as text and a '.csv' file as data from relative directories; accessing 'Freq' column for data expansion.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; no data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data is read from files -> expanded based on 'Freq' -> selected columns -> packaged into a structured object.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; reading a '.rst' file as data is unconventional; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs data loading and preprocessing with obfuscated identifiers, but contains no network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads. The reading of a '.rst' file is unusual but not harmful. Obfuscation is present but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or system modifications are evident. The dataset is expanded based on a 'Freq' column, and specific columns are selected for output. Overall, the code is benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern but not indicative of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data loading routine with obfuscation but no malicious intent or security risks. The current low malware and risk scores are appropriate; no changes are necessary.",
