      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated import and dynamic versioning, which are suspicious but not definitively malicious. No malicious activity or code is detected in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants further investigation, but current evidence suggests a low malware risk."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard autoencoder neural network with heavily obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or backdoors are detected. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious intent based solely on this segment. The assigned malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate. Continuous monitoring is recommended due to obfuscation, but the current assessment indicates the code is safe."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and uses pickle serialization, which can be exploited if inputs are manipulated. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and serialization activities pose potential security risks. The overall malware likelihood is moderate, with a high obfuscation score. It should be reviewed further before deployment, especially focusing on pickle handling and code transparency."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated variable assignment of a version string, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and does not warrant concern. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. No further action is necessary."

      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical ML pipeline with some obfuscation and system interactions that could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No active malware or malicious intent is evident. The primary security concern is the use of os.system for HDFS commands without input validation. Scores should reflect low malware likelihood (~0.1), moderate obfuscation (~0.6), and moderate risk (~0.4). The code warrants caution but does not show signs of malicious sabotage."

      "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malicious commands but relies on unsafe pickle operations that could be exploited if malicious pickle files are provided. Obfuscation and complex data handling increase the attack surface but do not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to unsafe deserialization practices, with a low likelihood of active malware presence."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate reinforcement learning framework with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware, malicious sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation is likely for proprietary or obfuscation purposes, not malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
