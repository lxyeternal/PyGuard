  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, possibly indicating package version.",
  "sources": "The right-hand side string '1.0.27' used as a value assignment.",
  "sinks": "The variable assignment itself does not constitute a sink; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the string '1.0.27' to the variable FhxQdcFEJZuhkzKuSVarpPUCvXECgKfB.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual and may suggest obfuscation. The code contains only a variable assignment with no context.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple variable assignment of a version string to a obfuscated variable name. There are no inputs, outputs, network activity, or suspicious behaviors. The variable name is unusual, which could indicate obfuscation or hiding intent, but without additional code, it remains benign. No malicious or security-risk behavior is evident from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward assignment of a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. No malicious behavior or security issues are apparent based solely on this fragment.",
