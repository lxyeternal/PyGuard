  "purpose": "A heavily obfuscated Python class implementing data interpolation, transformation, and serialization for machine learning preprocessing, with optional time series handling and parallel processing.",
  "sources": "Input data arrays, external pickle files for configuration, random state initialization, and parameters for interpolation.",
  "sinks": "Serialized configuration files via pickle, data arrays after transformation, and optional saved models or configurations.",
  "flows": "Data is validated and processed through interpolation, normalization, and sampling functions; then serialized with pickle if specified; parallel processing is used for efficiency.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names, complex logic with undefined variables ('trafo_values'), repeated use of pickle for serialization, and functions generating random Gaussian data with suspicious variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data transformation with interpolation and sampling, utilizing pickle for saving configurations, which can be exploited if file paths are controlled. Obfuscation and complex logic obscure intent, but no explicit malicious payloads such as network activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The heavy obfuscation and use of pickle raise security concerns, though the code appears primarily as a complex data preprocessing module. The incomplete code and suspicious function names suggest potential concealment of malicious behavior, warranting cautious review.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and uses pickle serialization, which can be exploited if inputs are manipulated. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and serialization activities pose potential security risks. The overall malware likelihood is moderate, with a high obfuscation score. It should be reviewed further before deployment, especially focusing on pickle handling and code transparency.",
