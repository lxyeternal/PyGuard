  "purpose": "Package setup script for 'RL_for_reco' with dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Import from 'RL_for_reco' module, specifically 'FhxQdcFEJZuhkzKuSVarpPUCvXECgKfB', used as version; reading 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Use of imported obfuscated symbol as version; reading 'README.md' without validation.",
  "flows": "Import from 'RL_for_reco' -> assignment to version parameter in setup() -> reading 'README.md'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import name 'FhxQdcFEJZuhkzKuSVarpPUCvXECgKfB'; dynamic assignment of version from imported symbol; obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with an unusual import from 'RL_for_reco' using an obfuscated symbol, which is then used as the package version. The import and variable naming suggest obfuscation or dynamic versioning, which could be used to hide malicious intent or manipulate version info. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is evident. The use of 'README.md' is standard. The suspicious elements are the obfuscated import and dynamic version assignment, but no concrete malicious behavior is observed. The scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.1, obfuscated ~0.5-0.7, risk ~0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the evidence. Further review of the 'RL_for_reco' package, especially the imported symbol, is recommended to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated import and dynamic versioning, which are suspicious but not definitively malicious. No malicious activity or code is detected in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants further investigation, but current evidence suggests a low malware risk.",
