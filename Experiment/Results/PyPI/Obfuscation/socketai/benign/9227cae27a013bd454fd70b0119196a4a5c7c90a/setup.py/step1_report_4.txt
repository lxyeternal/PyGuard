  "purpose": "Set up configuration for the Python package 'RL_for_reco' including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads from the 'RL_for_reco' module, 'path' module, and reads the content of 'README.md'.",
  "sinks": "Reads the entire content of 'README.md' and uses it as package long description.",
  "flows": "Imports module and reads README.md content for setup configuration; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import: 'from RL_for_reco import FhxQdcFEJZuhkzKuSVarpPUCvXECgKfB' which appears to be a non-standard, obfuscated or auto-generated symbol; the purpose is unclear. Variable and function names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious. No visible malicious code, but obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks: importing modules, defining dependencies, reading a README file, and configuring setuptools. The import statement from 'RL_for_reco' uses a likely obfuscated symbol name, which could be indicative of code hiding or malicious intent, but it is only an import statement with no further actions. The code reads the entire 'README.md' file and uses it as the long description, which is standard practice. There are no active network connections, no data exfiltration, no credential handling, or other suspicious behaviors observed. The obfuscated import could be an attempt to hide malicious code, but within this fragment, no malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical setup operations with an unusual import statement that could be obfuscated. No direct malicious behavior or malware is evident from this fragment. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported module to confirm its safety.",
