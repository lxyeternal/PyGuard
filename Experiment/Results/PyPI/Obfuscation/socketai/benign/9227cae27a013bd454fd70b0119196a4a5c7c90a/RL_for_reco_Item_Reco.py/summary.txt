  "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malicious commands but relies on unsafe pickle operations that could be exploited if malicious pickle files are provided. Obfuscation and complex data handling increase the attack surface but do not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to unsafe deserialization practices, with a low likelihood of active malware presence."
