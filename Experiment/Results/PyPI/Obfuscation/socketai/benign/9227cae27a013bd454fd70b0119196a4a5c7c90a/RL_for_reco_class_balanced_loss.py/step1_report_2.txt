{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement custom loss functions for training neural networks, specifically variants of focal loss and class-weighted loss functions, likely for classification tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data via function parameters such as 'labels' and 'logits', and uses numpy and torch tensors for computations.",
  "sinks": "The code performs tensor operations and loss calculations, with no evident data leaks, network connections, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input data ('labels' and 'logits') are processed through mathematical operations, weight calculations, and loss functions within the functions. The data flows from input parameters into loss calculations and returned scalar loss values.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code performs standard loss calculations using established methods. The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, file I/O, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements custom loss functions with parameterized weights and optional loss types ('focal', 'sigmoid', 'softmax'). It processes inputs securely using PyTorch functions, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated techniques, or malicious payloads. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic aligns with common loss implementations. No data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful behavior detected. The code appears to be intended for training neural networks with class imbalance handling, with no signs of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard neural network loss calculations with configurable parameters. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected. The obfuscation seems solely to obscure variable names, not malicious intent.",
