{
  "purpose": "The code implements custom loss functions and weight calculations for training neural networks, specifically focused on class balancing and loss adjustments for different loss types (focal, sigmoid, softmax).",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters: labels, logits, samples_per_cls, no_of_classes, and loss_type. External data may come from dataset inputs passed during function calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows into loss calculations via logits and labels, which are used in computations that could influence model training or output. However, no direct data leaks or malicious effects are evident.",
  "flows": "Inputs (labels, logits) are processed through calculations involving loss functions and class weights, resulting in loss values returned by the functions. No external or network connections are involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The code performs standard loss function computations with variable parameters and no obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one for a custom weighted binary cross-entropy loss with gamma adjustment, and another for class-weighted loss calculation supporting multiple loss types. It uses standard PyTorch and NumPy functions, with no suspicious operations. The calculations are typical for neural network training with class imbalance. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system harm are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate implementation of loss functions for deep learning training with class balancing strategies. There are no indicators of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is safe based on the provided content.",
