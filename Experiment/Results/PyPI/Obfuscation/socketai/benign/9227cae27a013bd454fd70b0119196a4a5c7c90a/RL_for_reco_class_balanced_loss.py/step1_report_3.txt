{
  "purpose": "This code defines functions for custom loss calculations used in training machine learning models, specifically for classification tasks with various loss functions such as focal, sigmoid, and softmax.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters: labels, logits, samples_per_cls, no_of_classes, loss_type, beta, gamma. Uses numpy and torch functions to process data.",
  "sinks": "Performs calculations that could influence model training, including binary cross-entropy, softmax, and custom weighting. No direct data leaks or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs (labels, logits, parameters) are processed through calculations, loss functions, and weighted sums. Data flows from source parameters through processing to the returned loss value.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains intentionally obfuscated variable names, which could hide malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual behaviors detected. Uses standard ML loss functions and calculations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements custom loss functions for neural network training, with flexible loss type options. Variable names are intentionally obscure but the logic aligns with typical loss computations, including class weighting and focal loss. No external data sources, network communication, or system modifications are observed. The obfuscation appears to be solely for hiding variable purpose, not malicious intent. No signs of data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom loss functions for machine learning, albeit with obfuscated variable names. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely for code concealment rather than malicious purposes.",
