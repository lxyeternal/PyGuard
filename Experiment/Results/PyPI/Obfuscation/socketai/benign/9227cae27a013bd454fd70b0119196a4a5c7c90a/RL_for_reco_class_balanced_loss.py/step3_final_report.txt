  "purpose": "Implementation of custom loss functions for neural network training, including weighted, focal, sigmoid, and softmax variants.",
  "sources": "Tensor operations involving logits and labels, reading input data for loss calculations.",
  "sinks": "Tensor computations that produce loss values; no external data leaks or system effects detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (labels, logits) flow through loss calculations, involving class weights and loss type conditions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious system activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard loss function computations used in deep learning, with obfuscation likely for concealment. No network activity, file I/O, or malicious system commands are present. Minor implementation issues (parameter mismatches) are identified but do not impact security. The obfuscation does not inherently imply malicious intent; the logic aligns with common loss functions. Malware score is correctly set to 0; obfuscation score is justified around 0.6 due to variable naming; security risk remains low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated implementation of neural network loss functions. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent, and the overall security risk is low.",
