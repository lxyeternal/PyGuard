  "conclusion": "The code is a typical ML pipeline with some obfuscation and system interactions that could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No active malware or malicious intent is evident. The primary security concern is the use of os.system for HDFS commands without input validation. Scores should reflect low malware likelihood (~0.1), moderate obfuscation (~0.6), and moderate risk (~0.4). The code warrants caution but does not show signs of malicious sabotage."
