  "purpose": "Minimal module importing an obfuscated symbol from a local source and exposing 'SourceSlack' in __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .source module, reading the symbol 'tKAfOvrChogSoZSlTrQJCNwsdUSoZoRr'.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import source to internal symbol; no data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical attribute name 'tKAfOvrChogSoZSlTrQJCNwsdUSoZoRr'; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single, obfuscated symbol from a local module and exposes 'SourceSlack'. No malicious code, data leaks, or active threats are evident. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Malware score is appropriately low (0), as no malicious activity is demonstrated. Obfuscation score is high (~0.7), justified by the nonsensical attribute name. Security risk score is low (~0.25), reflecting suspicion due to obfuscation but no active vulnerabilities. The code's minimal nature limits further analysis; the main concern is the obfuscated symbol which warrants further review of the source module.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet appears benign but uses an obfuscated attribute name, which warrants further investigation of the source module. No evidence of malicious behavior is present. Scores are consistent with the suspicion level, with low malware risk and moderate obfuscation concern.",
