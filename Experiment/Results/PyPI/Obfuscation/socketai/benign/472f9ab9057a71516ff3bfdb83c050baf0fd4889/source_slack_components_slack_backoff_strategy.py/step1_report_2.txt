  "purpose": "Define a custom backoff strategy class for handling retry delays based on HTTP response headers.",
  "sources": "Reading from response.headers to extract 'Retry-After' header; logging info messages.",
  "sinks": "None directly, but potential reliance on response headers for backoff timing.",
  "flows": "Input Response or RequestException -> Check headers -> Return Retry-After value or default 5 seconds.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of BackoffStrategy that logs info and returns a retry delay based on the 'Retry-After' header. It correctly checks the instance type and header presence. No obfuscated code patterns or malicious logic detected. The naming conventions are suspiciously obfuscated, which may indicate code repurposing or concealment but does not imply malicious intent on its own. No external data exfiltration, system modification, or harmful behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a legitimate backoff strategy for HTTP requests, with no malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. The obfuscated class name is suspicious but not harmful by itself.",
