  "purpose": "Implements a backoff strategy that determines retry delay based on the 'Retry-After' header in HTTP responses or exceptions.",
  "sources": "Reads response headers for 'Retry-After' in the method rUlkkXigwZjUEIwGUfDLjDglmXBQNpKG",
  "sinks": "Logs info message if header not found; returns delay value (int or default 5)",
  "flows": "Source: response_or_exception.headers['Retry-After'] -> Sink: return int value or default delay",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are heavily obfuscated, which is suspicious but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from BackoffStrategy, checking for 'Retry-After' header in responses or exceptions. It logs info if header absent and returns a delay. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or code injection observed. Obfuscation of names is suspicious but not malicious. The code performs standard retry logic. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident. The obfuscation warrants a higher suspicion score but does not imply malicious intent. The code is straightforward and safe, with a low security risk. The malware score is justified as 0, and the obfuscation score is high (~0.75). The overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of a retry backoff strategy based on HTTP headers. The obfuscation of class and method names is suspicious but not malicious. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Overall, the code is safe, with obfuscation being the primary concern but not a security threat.",
