  "purpose": "Define a custom backoff strategy class for handling retry logic in HTTP requests within an Airbyte source connector.",
  "sources": "The class constructor reads a logger object; the method reads an HTTP Response or RequestException object.",
  "sinks": "The method may log information; it reads response headers for Retry-After, but does not write or execute untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Response/exception object -> method -> checks headers -> logs info -> returns retry delay value.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, which appear intentionally nonsensical; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of BackoffStrategy with obfuscated class and method names. It uses a logger passed in constructor to log info messages. The core method inspects the response or exception for a 'Retry-After' header and returns its integer value if present, otherwise defaults to 5 seconds. The logic appears straightforward and aligned with typical backoff strategies. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. The obfuscated naming may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the code functionality itself is benign and standard.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard backoff strategy with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The primary concern is the obfuscated naming which could hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent.",
