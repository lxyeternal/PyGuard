  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for an Airbyte Slack source with heavy obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior is present, but the obfuscation raises suspicion. The malware score should remain low, and the obfuscation score high. Overall, the security risk is moderate due to potential concealment, warranting further investigation."
