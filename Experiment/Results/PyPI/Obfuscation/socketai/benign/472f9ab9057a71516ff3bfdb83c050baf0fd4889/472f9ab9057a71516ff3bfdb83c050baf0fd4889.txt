The malware score should remain low, and the obfuscation score high. Overall, the security risk is moderate due to potential concealment, warranting further investigation."

The high obfuscation and credential management practices warrant caution, especially if deployed in untrusted environments. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood remains low but non-negligible."

The primary concern is the obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The malware score should remain low, with a high obfuscation score justified. Overall, the code appears benign but should be monitored if part of a larger suspicious context."

Overall, the code is safe, with obfuscation being the primary concern but not a security threat."
