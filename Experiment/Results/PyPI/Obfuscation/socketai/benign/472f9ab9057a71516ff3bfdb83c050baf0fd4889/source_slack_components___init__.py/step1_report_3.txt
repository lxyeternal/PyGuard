{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a utility or module related to cybersecurity analysis, possibly for analyzing other code or data inputs.",
  "sources": "Data sources include input functions (such as reading user input or file data), environment variables, and network connections (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network sockets, file writes, subprocess calls, or system commands that could be exploited if untrusted data reaches them.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env variables) to sinks (system/network calls), potentially without proper validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual variable names are evident. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly; no indicators of malicious behavior were observed. It does not contain malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining scripts. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical, with no signs of malicious intent. The code structure and logic appear consistent with legitimate cybersecurity utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The code appears to be a benign cybersecurity utility or analysis script. Confidence in this conclusion is high given the code's straightforward nature and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
