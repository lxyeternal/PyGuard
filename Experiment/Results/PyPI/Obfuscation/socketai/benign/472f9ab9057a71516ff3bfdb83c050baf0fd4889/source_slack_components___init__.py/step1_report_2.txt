  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a security review or analysis of Python packages for malicious or insecure behaviors.",
  "sources": "Input sources include any environment variables, user inputs, or external data sources accessed via functions or modules such as os.environ, input(), or network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls (os.system, subprocess), network communications (sockets, requests), file writes/deletes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/environment/network) to sinks (system commands, network, file system), potentially passing through processing or validation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hard-coded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual or malicious behavior identified. Code appears to follow standard practices, with no hidden or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code has been examined thoroughly. No signs of malicious intent such as data theft, remote access, or hidden backdoors are present. Usage of third-party libraries is typical, and no insecure coding patterns or suspicious behaviors are found. The structure and format are standard, and there are no signs of obfuscation or malware. All data handling appears legitimate and transparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code seems benign and follows standard practices. The overall security risk is low.",
