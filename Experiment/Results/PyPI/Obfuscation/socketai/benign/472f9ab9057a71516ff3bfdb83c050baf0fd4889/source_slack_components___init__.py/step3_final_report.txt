  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, standard input/output, data handling functions, system calls, network connections, environment variables, potential I/O points.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file system, environment variables, system commands, data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs/environment variables) to sinks (network, file system, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. It uses standard libraries and functions, with no suspicious network connections, data leaks, or backdoors. The absence of code or suspicious patterns indicates benign behavior. The security review aligns with the low malware and obfuscation scores, and the low security risk score reflects minimal threat. Confidence is high where code is present; low where code is absent. No anomalies or malicious indicators are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score is zero. The code's benign nature is supported by the thorough review and lack of suspicious signals.",
