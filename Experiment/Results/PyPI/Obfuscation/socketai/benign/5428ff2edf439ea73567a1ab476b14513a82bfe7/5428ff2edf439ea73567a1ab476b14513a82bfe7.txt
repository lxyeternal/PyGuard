There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerability present. The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified, and the minimal risk score accounts for the pattern repetition but does not indicate threat."

Other reports are consistent with benign or low-risk code. The scores are justified and aligned with the evidence, indicating a moderate overall threat level primarily driven by report 2's suspicious patterns."
