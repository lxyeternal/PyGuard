{
  "purpose": "Weather data visualization, formatting dates, calculating temperature ranges, rendering templates to images.",
  "sources": "Input object properties (e.g., noSPheaSiCgEmNYhbmJfwYJkoQUGLrPQ), configuration, external rendering function 'template_to_pic'.",
  "sinks": "Rendering images via 'template_to_pic', no network or file leaks, no external command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input objects and configs through formatting and calculation functions into the rendering template.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive variable and function names; no suspicious code, secrets, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs weather data processing, date/time formatting, temperature range calculations, and rendering images. Obfuscation is significant but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The functions rely on standard libraries and legitimate rendering functions. The obfuscation may hinder understanding but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a weather visualization module with high obfuscation but no signs of malware or malicious activity. The low security risk score is justified. The obfuscation score reflects the obscurity of variable names, but overall, the code appears benign.",
