  "purpose": "Generate a JWT token for QWeather service authentication using provided configuration and private key.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration variables (qweather_jwt_sub, qweather_jwt_kid, qweather_jwt_private_key), system time.",
  "sinks": "Calls jwt.encode() to produce a JWT token string.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables and time data flow into jwt.encode() to generate a token, which could be used for authentication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of system time with a -30 second offset and +900 seconds expiration is normal; no hardcoded secrets observed. The code raises an exception if config items are missing.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JWT token creation, validating the presence of configuration secrets, and generating a token with expiration and issued-at times. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. The use of jwt.encode() appears legitimate and typical for token generation. No obfuscation or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for creating a JWT token with necessary configuration validation. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The code appears safe and well-structured.",
