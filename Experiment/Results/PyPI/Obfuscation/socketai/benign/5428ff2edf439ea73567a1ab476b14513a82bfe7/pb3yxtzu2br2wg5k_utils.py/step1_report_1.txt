  "purpose": "Generate a JWT token using provided configuration parameters for authentication or authorization.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration variables: plugin_config.qweather_jwt_sub, plugin_config.qweather_jwt_kid, plugin_config.qweather_jwt_private_key; Uses time() for timestamps; Calls encode() to generate JWT.",
  "sinks": "Calls jwt.encode with the private key, which may involve sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Configuration variables are validated, then timestamps and claims are set; these are encoded with the private key to produce a JWT token.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns. Use of time() is straightforward. The variable and function names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The JWT creation appears standard but uses an uncommon algorithm (EdDSA).",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JWT creation: it checks for necessary configuration, sets issued-at and expiration times, constructs JWT headers and payload, and encodes with a private key. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leakage. The obfuscated variable names are a concern but do not imply malicious intent. No malicious network activity, file manipulation, or privilege escalation evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate JWT generation function with no evident malicious behavior. Obfuscation of variable names is noted but does not necessarily imply malicious intent. No security risks identified beyond typical JWT handling.",
