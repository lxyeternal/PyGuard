  "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that report 2 exhibits significant malicious indicators, warranting a higher malware score (adjusted from 0.6 to 0.7). Other reports are consistent with benign or low-risk code. The scores are justified and aligned with the evidence, indicating a moderate overall threat level primarily driven by report 2's suspicious patterns."
