  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, hardcoded credentials, eval/exec usage, obfuscated segments, external connections.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution, external network connections, access to environment variables.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (hardcoded secrets, eval/exec, external data) to sinks (network connections, data leaks).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation without clear malicious activity, hardcoded secrets, use of eval/exec, suspicious external connections.",
  "analysis": "The code contains typical indicators of malicious intent such as hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, and obfuscation. Absence of code in some reports leads to high confidence in benign assessment. Suspicious patterns are consistent with high malware and obfuscation scores in reports 2 and 4. The scores align with the described behaviors, with minor room for adjustment based on severity of indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment is that report 2 exhibits significant malicious indicators, warranting a higher malware score (adjusted from 0.6 to 0.7). Other reports are consistent with benign or low-risk code. The scores are justified and aligned with the evidence, indicating a moderate overall threat level primarily driven by report 2's suspicious patterns.",
