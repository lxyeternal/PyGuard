  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific function within a Python package, possibly related to data processing or utility functions. No explicit malicious intent is apparent from the code structure and comments.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, function arguments, and possibly from files or network sources if present (not shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to the console, writing to files, executing code dynamically, or network communication if present (not visible in the snippet).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input functions or environment variables through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as output functions or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are detected. No backdoors, hidden behaviors, or suspicious code structures are apparent.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review shows the code performs typical utility functions with standard library usage. No signs of malicious activity, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or unauthorized system access, are present. The code is well-structured, with no suspicious anomalies or hidden behaviors. Without external dependencies or network code visible, the likelihood of malicious intent remains low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility or application code. No indicators of supply chain attacks or malware are found.",
