  "purpose": "Define configuration schema for a weather-related API with optional JWT authentication.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration values via pydantic Fields, including API host, API key, JWT parameters, and debug flag.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks are present; no untrusted input or data is processed or outputted in a way that could lead to data leaks or execution of malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are set via environment or file inputs (through get_plugin_config), but there are no direct flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains deprecated and commented-out/deprecated fields, which are not inherently malicious but could indicate poor maintenance. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a pydantic model for plugin configuration with various parameters, some marked as deprecated. It uses a configuration getter to load settings. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious activity. No external network calls or dynamic code execution are present. The structure appears to be standard configuration handling for a plugin system.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical configuration schema with no signs of malicious intent or malware. It does not perform any suspicious actions or data leaks. The presence of deprecated fields suggests some maintenance issues but not malicious activity.",
