  "purpose": "Configuration schema for weather API integration, including optional JWT settings and API credentials.",
  "sources": "Fields such as qweather_apihost, qweather_apikey, qweather_jwt_sub, qweather_jwt_private_key, qweather_jwt_kid, and environment or default values.",
  "sinks": "Potential exposure of API keys, JWT secrets, or other sensitive data if mishandled; no direct data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration fields loaded into plugin settings; no dynamic or external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, deprecated fields, default placeholder values for secrets, and some default URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Pydantic configuration model for a weather plugin, with optional JWT support. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or malicious patterns are present. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt at concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Deprecated fields and default placeholders for secrets are typical in configuration schemas but require careful secret management. The reports correctly identify the benign nature, with some noting obfuscation and potential secret exposure risks. Overall, the code shows low security risk and no malware, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration schema with no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation in naming is noted but not malicious. Proper secret management is recommended. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.6 in the most obfuscated case), and overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
