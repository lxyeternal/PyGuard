  "purpose": "Define configuration schema for a weather-related plugin with optional JWT authentication, using pydantic models and loading plugin config.",
  "sources": "get_plugin_config() call; Field initializations with default values; environment or user inputs for configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive fields such as qweather_apikey, qweather_jwt_private_key, qweather_jwt_kid, which could contain secrets; deprecated warnings suggest security considerations.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from plugin configuration source into model fields, especially sensitive data such as API keys and JWT secrets.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of deprecated fields and warning comments about sensitive information; no actual use of untrusted input or dynamic code execution. Field default values seem static and are unlikely malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a data model for plugin configuration, with default values and deprecated annotations. No suspicious or malicious code is present. The configuration includes sensitive information placeholders, but this is typical for configuration schemas. No obfuscated code, external network calls, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The deprecated message indicates awareness of security best practices, but no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration schema definition with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. It handles sensitive data as configuration parameters, which is typical and not inherently malicious.",
