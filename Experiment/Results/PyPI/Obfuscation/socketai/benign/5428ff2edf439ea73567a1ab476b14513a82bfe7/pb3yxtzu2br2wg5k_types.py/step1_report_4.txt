  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated attribute strings.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Attribute string values are assigned but not used elsewhere in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class names and attribute values without context; no apparent purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three custom exception classes with obscure names, each containing a class attribute assigned to a seemingly random string. No methods or behavior are defined. The attribute strings are not used elsewhere in this fragment, and there are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The obfuscation might be a tactic to hide malicious intent, but with no active code or suspicious behavior present, it appears to be an attempt at code hiding or simple obfuscation rather than malicious activity. Without further context, the purpose is unclear but does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of obfuscated class definitions with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation alone is not sufficient to determine malicious intent, but it warrants caution if found in larger, unexplained codebases.",
