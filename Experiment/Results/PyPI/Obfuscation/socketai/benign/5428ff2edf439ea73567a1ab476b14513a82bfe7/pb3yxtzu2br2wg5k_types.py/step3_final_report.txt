{
  "purpose": "The code defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names and class-level string variables assigned to random strings, likely serving as placeholders or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class-level string variables",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external network or file interactions, or data processing present",
  "flows": "No data flows or external data sources to sinks; purely class declarations",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and string variables with no functional logic or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of obfuscated class declarations with static string variables, lacking functions, data flows, or external interactions. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or harmful operations are evident. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the absence of active behavior suggests benign nature. The obfuscation is consistent across reports, and the lack of any suspicious activity supports a low malware and security risk assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but benign in isolation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute a threat based on this fragment. Scores should reflect minimal risk and no malware presence.",
