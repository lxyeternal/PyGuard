{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with associated string variables, likely for error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string assignments, no input/output or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only defines classes and variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names and variable names; no functional behavior shown. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three custom exception classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated names, each containing a class-level string variable assigned a seemingly random string. The code lacks any actual logic, input/output operations, or use of these variables in a way that suggests malicious activity. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt to hide intent, but on its own, it is not necessarily malicious. The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger, obscured codebase, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code defines obfuscated exception classes and associated string variables without any malicious behavior or security risks evident. No harmful operations or data exfiltration mechanisms are present in this fragment.",
