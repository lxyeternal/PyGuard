{
  "purpose": "The code defines three custom exception classes, likely for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The class definitions and the associated string variables that seem to contain encoded or random data.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks that process untrusted data, execute commands, or leak information.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only declares classes and variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple classes with obfuscated or random-looking variable names and strings that appear to be nonsensical or encoded. No meaningful logic or data handling is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception, along with associated string variables containing seemingly random data. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. The obfuscated naming and arbitrary strings could suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, but without further code or context, these are just obfuscation signs. No suspicious behaviors such as network calls, file operations, or data leakage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be simple class definitions with obfuscated variable names and strings. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code does not perform any operations, data handling, or external interactions that would suggest malicious intent.",
