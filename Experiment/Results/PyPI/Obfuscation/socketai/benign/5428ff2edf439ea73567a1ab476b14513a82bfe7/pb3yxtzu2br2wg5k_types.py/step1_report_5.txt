{
  "purpose": "The code defines three custom exception classes with associated seemingly random string attributes, likely for error handling or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and attribute assignments; no input or data reading mechanisms present.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are isolated with no invocation or data manipulation beyond attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and attribute strings without context; no clear functional purpose; no data validation, input handling, or external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception, with attributes assigned random strings. There is no evidence of input reading, data processing, or interaction with external systems. The obfuscated naming might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious actions such as network activity, file operations, or data exfiltration are present. The code appears to serve as a placeholder or obfuscated error handling, with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but lacks any active malicious behavior, suspicious network or file operations, or data leaks. It appears to be benign, possibly intentionally obscured.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
