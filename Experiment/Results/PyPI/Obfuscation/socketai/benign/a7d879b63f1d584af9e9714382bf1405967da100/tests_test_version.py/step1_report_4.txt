  "sinks": "None, since there are no operations that process or output data, especially untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows or execution flows are present due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a comment indicating it is an example, but no actual code or suspicious constructs are present. The line contains only a comment with no malicious or unusual code.",
