  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly network communication, but the specific purpose cannot be determined definitively without further context.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or data read from files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive functions such as network requests, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, which may include network or file output.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are visible. Watch for dynamic code execution, but none is evident here.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with standard Python constructs. No signs of obfuscated or malicious behavior are present. It uses third-party libraries normally found in legitimate projects. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are detectable based on the provided snippet. The code lacks any unusual or unsafe coding patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code. It appears to be a benign, standard Python script. Confidence is high due to lack of suspicious patterns. No obfuscation or malware detected.",
