  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, file/network I/O, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Output to files, network, console; potential data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to output sinks, possibly via environment variables or user input.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either empty, incomplete, or straightforward data processing routines. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are observed. The low confidence scores reflect limited code context, but the absence of indicators supports benign classification. The data flow is typical for utility scripts, with no evidence of malicious data exfiltration or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) appropriately accounts for potential minor vulnerabilities inherent in data handling routines. All reports' assessments are consistent and justified.",
