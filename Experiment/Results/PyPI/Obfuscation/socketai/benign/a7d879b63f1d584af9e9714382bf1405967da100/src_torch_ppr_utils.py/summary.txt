  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of graph processing routines with no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. Overall security risk is low, and malware score should be 0.0. Obfuscation score around 0.65 is appropriate, with a low risk score (~0.2)."
