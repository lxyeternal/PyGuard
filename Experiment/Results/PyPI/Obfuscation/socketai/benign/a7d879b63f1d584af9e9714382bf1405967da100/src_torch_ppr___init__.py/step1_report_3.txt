{
  "purpose": "The code exports two functions, 'page_rank' and 'personalized_page_rank', from a local module 'api', likely for external use.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.api' for functions 'page_rank' and 'personalized_page_rank'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication is observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code only defines exports without processing input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward module initializer that imports specific functions from a local module and defines an export list. It contains no user input handling, no external network interactions, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious logic. The structure is simple and typical for Python package modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module that exposes functions from a local API module. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
