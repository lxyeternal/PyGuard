{
  "purpose": "This code module exports functions related to page ranking algorithms, likely part of a larger project that performs graph or web page ranking tasks.",
  "sources": "The code imports functions 'page_rank' and 'personalized_page_rank' from a local module '.api'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leaks are present; the code itself does not handle untrusted data or output.",
  "flows": "The module simply re-exports imported functions; there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports two functions from a local API module and defines an __all__ list for exports. It does not contain any complex logic, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. It appears to be a standard part of a package, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a re-export of functions related to page ranking. There are no security risks or malware indicators detected.",
