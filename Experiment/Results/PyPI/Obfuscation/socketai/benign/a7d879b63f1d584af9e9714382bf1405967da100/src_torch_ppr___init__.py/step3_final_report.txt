  "purpose": "A minimal Python module that imports two functions from a local '.api' module and re-exports them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.api' module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external communication, no data leaks",
  "flows": "Import source to re-export via __all__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, or unusual patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward re-export module with no dynamic behavior, input handling, or external interactions. It contains only import statements and an __all__ list, which is standard in Python package design. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The code does not process untrusted data, perform network operations, or execute code that could be exploited. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, assigning a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk score of 0. The confidence in this assessment is high (1), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's straightforward nature.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
