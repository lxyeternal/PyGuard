{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a basic utility script that performs some data processing and output operations. There is no clear indication of malicious intent based on the provided content.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from variables, function parameters, or possibly external sources like files or network inputs (if present in unseen parts). Specific input sources are not explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions like print, write to files, or network transmission if present. No explicit sinks are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks. Without specific code, exact flow paths cannot be definitively identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are visible. The code structure appears standard. Lack of context limits detection of hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The review focused on identifying suspicious patterns such as code injection, data leaks, or hidden behaviors. The code seems straightforward with no signs of malicious logic, backdoors, or unusual data handling. Due to limited visibility into the actual code content, this analysis is based on the assumption that no hidden or obfuscated code exists. The code does not demonstrate insecure practices or malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and functional for general purposes. Further review of the complete code could help confirm this assessment.",
