  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function, but without seeing the actual code, the precise intent cannot be determined. It might be a utility, data processing, or network interaction script.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading environment variables, file reads, network inputs, or user input prompts. Exact sources are unclear without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve writing to files, network transmissions, executing commands, or modifying system state. Precise sinks cannot be identified without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flow likely involves input gathering, processing or validation, and subsequent output or network transmission. Without the code, specific source-to-sink paths cannot be mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without viewing the code. Possible anomalies include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated logic, or unusual imports, but none are explicitly observed here.",
  "analysis": "Due to lack of actual code content, a detailed step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. Normally, this would involve examining code structure, data handling, and suspicious patterns. Here, the absence of code prevents in-depth analysis.",
  "conclusion": "There is insufficient information to determine if this code contains malicious behavior or security risks. No evident malicious indicators are present in the provided content, but the analysis cannot be finalized without the actual code.",
