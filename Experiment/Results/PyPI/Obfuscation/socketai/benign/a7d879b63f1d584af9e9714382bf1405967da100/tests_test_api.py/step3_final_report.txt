  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security and potential malicious behavior of the provided Python dependency code.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, network connections, file reads, and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network sockets, file writes, environment variable modifications, and system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or network inputs to sinks like network transmissions or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic detected; code is missing or benign based on descriptions.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence or incompleteness of code, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores (0). Security risk scores are conservatively set at 0.2 in some reports, reflecting cautious uncertainty; however, given the lack of evidence, these could be adjusted to 0 or 0.1. Confidence scores align with the amount of information, mostly high where code is described as benign, and low where code is missing. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified. The reasoning is consistent and appropriate across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risk in the provided code descriptions. The scores are justified and consistent with the available information. Minor adjustments to the security risk scores could be made to reflect even greater certainty, but current assessments are reasonable.",
