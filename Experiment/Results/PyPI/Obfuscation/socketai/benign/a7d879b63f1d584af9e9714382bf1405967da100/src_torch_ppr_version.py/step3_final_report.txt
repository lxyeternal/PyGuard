  "purpose": "Minimal Python script serving as a module placeholder or instruction for running via 'python -m torch_ppr.version'.",
  "sources": "Comments and encoding declaration; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code contains only comments and a shebang.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple encoding declaration and a comment indicating how to run a module. All reports correctly identify the absence of executable logic, malicious patterns, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the code's benign nature. Confidence is high (1), as the code is trivial and clearly non-malicious. No signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, serving as a placeholder or documentation snippet within a larger package. All assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
