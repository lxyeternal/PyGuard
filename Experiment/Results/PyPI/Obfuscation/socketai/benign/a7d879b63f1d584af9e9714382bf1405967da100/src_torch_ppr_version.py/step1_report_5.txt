  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple module header with a command to run a specific module or script using Python.",
  "sources": "The only source is the script's own execution command 'python -m torch_ppr.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in the snippet; the code does not process or transfer any data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a shebang and a comment instructing how to run a module; no suspicious or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration and a comment indicating how to run a specific module. No executable code, data input, or data processing logic exists. There are no hardcoded credentials, external calls, or malicious patterns. The presence of the run command in a comment suggests the script is part of a package or module but does not contain malicious behavior itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is benign and purely informational with no malicious intent. It serves as a module identifier or documentation. No security risks or malware indications are detected.",
