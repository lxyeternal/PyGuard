{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a script to run a specific module, likely for version checking or information display for the 'torch_ppr' package.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it contains only a shebang line, encoding declaration, and a comment with a command to run a module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs; no untrusted data handling or output points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code does not perform any operations or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains minimal content, mainly a comment instructing how to run a module, with no suspicious or unusual code structures, secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is extremely minimal, consisting of a shebang, encoding declaration, and a comment. It does not perform any data input, processing, or output. The comment suggests running a module via Python's '-m' flag, which is standard practice. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a simple script or instruction header. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected.",
