{
  "purpose": "This code contains only a character encoding declaration, serving to specify UTF-8 encoding in a Python file.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code is a static comment line.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code is purely declarative with no execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a minimal, standard encoding declaration with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single comment line specifying UTF-8 encoding, with no executable logic, variables, imports, or data handling. All reports correctly identify it as benign, minimal, and free of malicious or security concerns. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the content. There are no anomalies or suspicious features. The code poses no threat and is a standard practice in Python 2 files to declare encoding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, contains only an encoding declaration, and poses no security risk. All reports are accurate, and their scoring is justified. No further action is necessary.",
