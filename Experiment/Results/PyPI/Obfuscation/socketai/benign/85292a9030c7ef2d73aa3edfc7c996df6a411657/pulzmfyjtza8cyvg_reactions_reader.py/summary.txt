  "conclusion": "The script exhibits behaviors consistent with data collection and potential exfiltration, with obfuscated code and external communications raising security concerns. While no direct malware or payloads are identified, the external endpoints and data handling practices warrant caution. The malware score is set at 0.3, reflecting low but notable malicious potential; the security risk score is 0.6, justified by external communication and data privacy issues."
