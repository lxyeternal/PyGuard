  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from internal modules for use in the current module.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load functions/classes from sibling modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no runtime data flow or untrusted data transfer occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are non-descriptive and appear as random strings; no indication of malicious intent or obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of import statements from internal modules, importing functions/classes with obfuscated names. There is no executable code, no data handling, no external network connections, or other suspicious activity. The naming pattern could suggest obfuscation, but it is also possible these are legitimate randomly named identifiers. Without further context or code execution, no malicious activity can be inferred. The imports are straightforward and do not reveal malicious behavior on their own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to importing obfuscated names from internal modules, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The unusual naming might suggest obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
