  "purpose": "Assessment of import statements with obfuscated identifiers for potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules with obfuscated or non-descriptive names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only static imports without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated identifiers, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but no active malicious code or data handling is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules with obfuscated names, with no executable code, network activity, or data handling. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.6-0.8, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the evidence. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present based solely on these imports. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules but does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, consisting only of import statements with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation warrants further inspection of the modules, there is no current evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
