{
  "purpose": "The code imports functions or classes from local modules, likely for processing or handling reactions and data transformations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: main_script_, reactions_reader, data_transformer.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output functions are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only performs static imports without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers such as bJHJXInzxouybHIEGviaTwDyWgfaEcER, AgGMDPIJxWYyXJGcsErGWFFxFaqzhroP, and WmDXKXIscUxvuqvXYJLEWllumegVnxEQ appear obfuscated, which could suggest attempts at hiding malicious intent, but could also be code obfuscation or name mangling.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple relative imports with obfuscated function or class names. No executable logic, data handling, or external communications are present. The obfuscated identifiers raise suspicion but could be legitimate if intentionally obscured. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows within this snippet. The presence of obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily consists of import statements with obfuscated names, which could be benign or an attempt at concealment. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity within this snippet, but the obfuscated identifiers merit further inspection of the imported modules for hidden behavior.",
