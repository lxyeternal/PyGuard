  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules within a package",
  "sources": "Imports from modules: .main_script_, .reactions_reader, and .data_transformer",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; imports do not process untrusted data or execute code",
  "flows": "N/A - import statements do not create data flows or execution paths",
  "anomalies": "Imports consist of obfuscated-looking identifiers (e.g., bJHJXInzxouybHIEGviaTwDyWgfaEcER), which may indicate obfuscation or concealed intent",
  "analysis": "The code performs module imports from relative paths using non-descriptive, seemingly random function and variable names. No execution of untrusted data, no dynamic code execution, and no use of environment variables or external inputs are evident. The identifiers appear obfuscated, but the import statements themselves are typical for Python packages. Without additional code, these imports alone do not indicate malicious intent. The obfuscated names could be innocuous or designed to hide functionality, but there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of standard import statements with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident solely from these import statements. The use of obfuscated names warrants further review of the imported modules themselves, but based on this snippet, the code appears benign.",
