  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Reads local file and passes data into setup parameters; no external data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'IbCzvyEvylqNtndzCwJaQwifrWjIHPdv') and inconsistent key naming suggest obfuscation or non-standard coding practices. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py for packaging a Python project, with unusual variable naming that may suggest obfuscation. It reads 'README.md' for long description, defines package requirements, and specifies console scripts. No evidence of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious payloads. The use of 'setuptools' is typical for package setup. No suspicious external calls or code injections observed.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation is likely unintentional or stylistic rather than malicious.",
