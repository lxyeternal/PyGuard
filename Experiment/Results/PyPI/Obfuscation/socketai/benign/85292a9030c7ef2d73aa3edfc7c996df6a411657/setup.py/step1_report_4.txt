{
  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python project, including dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, package metadata, and dependencies listed in 'install_requires'.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks or external network interactions; no use of functions that send data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "The code reads a local file ('README.md') and processes static configuration data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and unusual indentation; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious dynamic code execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a setup function with a local file read for long description, and packages configuration data including dependencies and entry points. The obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'IbCzvyEvylqNtndzCwJaQwifrWjIHPdv') do not by themselves indicate malicious intent. No external network activity, code injection, or data leakage mechanisms are present. All data appears static and part of standard package setup procedures. The overall structure conforms to typical Python package configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No malware or security risks identified based on the provided code.",
