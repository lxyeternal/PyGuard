{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies and entry points with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines dependencies and console scripts; uses obfuscated variable and function names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or network interactions; no code injection or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Static configuration data loaded from files and constants; no dynamic or external data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; unusual keys in setup() parameters; no comments or documentation; non-standard key names.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated identifiers, likely for stylistic or concealment reasons. No network activity, malicious payloads, or suspicious behaviors are detected. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution. The absence of network calls, data leaks, or code injection indicates a benign configuration. The obfuscation scores are higher due to naming but do not correlate with malicious activity. Overall, the code appears to be a typical package setup with obfuscation, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation is present but not indicative of malicious intent. The package appears benign, with minimal security concern.",
