{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform translation of text using Google Translate's mobile interface, involving URL requests and HTML parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data is taken from function parameters, specifically text to translate, and environment info from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from input parameters to URL requests, and HTML parsing extracts translation results. No clear sink leads to system modification or external data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input string -> URL encoding -> HTTP request -> HTML response -> Regex extraction -> HTML decoding -> output translation",
  "anomalies": "Use of user-agent string with an outdated browser, and inconsistent variable naming. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious URL domains. The code uses standard libraries without obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to import appropriate modules, encodes input text, constructs a URL to Google Translate's mobile page, and performs an HTTP request with a custom user-agent. It then reads the response, decodes it, and uses regex to extract the translation. The overall logic is straightforward and relies on publicly accessible endpoints. No malicious or backdoor code is present. The regex searches for specific HTML classes associated with the translation container. There is no indication of data leakage, command execution, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of a translation utility that scrapes Google Translate's mobile site. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior is detected. It functions as a translation helper without security risks.",
