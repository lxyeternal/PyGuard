  "purpose": "Re-export the 'translate' function from the local 'core' module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import from __future__ and local module '.core'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, network activity, or external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Import source to __all__ assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module that imports 'translate' from a local module and exposes it via __all__. It includes a __future__ import for compatibility. There are no data inputs, network activity, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, and high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign module with no malicious or security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
