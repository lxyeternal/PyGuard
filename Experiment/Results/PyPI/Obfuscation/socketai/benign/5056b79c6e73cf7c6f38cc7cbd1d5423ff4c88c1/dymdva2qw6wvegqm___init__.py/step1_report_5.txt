  "purpose": "Export the 'translate' function from the core module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '__future__' and local import from '.core'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code, no suspicious or unusual patterns; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports by importing a feature from the '__future__' module and re-exporting a 'translate' function from a local module. No external data input handling, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution are present. The structure is typical for Python modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, performing standard module import and export tasks with no signs of malicious behavior.",
