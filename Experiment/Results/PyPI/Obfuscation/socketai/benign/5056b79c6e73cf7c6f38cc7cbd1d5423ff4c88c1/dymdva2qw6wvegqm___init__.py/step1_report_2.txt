{
  "purpose": "To provide an interface for the 'translate' function, likely for translation or language processing.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'absolute_import' feature and the 'translate' function from a local 'core' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports a feature and a function, then exposes 'translate' for external use; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a compatibility feature from __future__ to ensure consistent import behavior across Python versions. It imports a 'translate' function from a local module named 'core' and explicitly exposes 'translate' via __all__. There are no external data sources, no execution of dynamic code, and no suspicious behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward module interface setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module stub that imports and exposes a 'translate' function. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
