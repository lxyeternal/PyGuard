  "purpose": "Module that re-exports the 'translate' function from a submodule.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from the local 'core' module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs an import and export operation.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code, secrets, or obfuscation. Very minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple Python module that imports a function 'translate' from a sibling module 'core' and exposes it via the __all__ list. It includes a future import for absolute_import, which is standard in Python 2/3 compatibility. There are no data inputs, no network activity, no code execution beyond imports, and no suspicious patterns or malicious indicators present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard module re-export pattern with no malicious behavior or security concerns. The code is straightforward and safe.",
