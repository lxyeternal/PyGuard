  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code snippets are very minimal, consisting solely of an import from `__future__` and a local module, and defining `__all__`.\n- No data flows, no external inputs, no network activity, no dynamic code execution.\n- No signs of obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- The purpose is clearly to re-export a function named `translate` from a local module `core`.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code matches the original provided code.\n- No issues or malicious behavior are present.\n- The code is straightforward and safe.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical errors or flaws are evident in the reasoning.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign:\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `confidence`: 1\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators.\n- No adjustments needed.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Since all reports agree on zero malware and security risk, and the code is just a module interface, there is no justification for higher scores.\n- The scores are reasonable.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume the code is benign based on static analysis; this is correct.\n- No assumptions about hidden malicious behavior are warranted here.\n\n### Consistency:\n- All scores and conclusions are consistent with the code and the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple module re-export pattern with no malicious or suspicious behavior, no obfuscation, and no security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No changes are necessary. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the analysis and the code's nature.",
