  "purpose": "A command-line tool to translate text between languages using an imported 'translate' function from the core module.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments via sys.argv, specifically sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], and optionally sys.argv[3]",
  "sinks": "Calling the 'translate' function with user-provided input; printing the translated result",
  "flows": "sys.argv inputs -> translate() function -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious imports or network activity; usage appears straightforward and benign",
  "analysis": "The script reads user input from command-line arguments to determine the text to translate and language parameters. It imports a 'translate' function from a local core module, which is presumed to handle the actual translation. No network calls, file access, or environment variables are used directly in this script. The code includes a help message for usage. The structure is simple, and there are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The only potential concern could be the 'translate' function in the core module, but that is outside this code's scope. Overall, the script functions as a basic CLI translation tool without apparent malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign command-line translation utility that reads input, processes it via an imported translate function, and outputs the result. There are no indicators of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks within this code snippet.",
