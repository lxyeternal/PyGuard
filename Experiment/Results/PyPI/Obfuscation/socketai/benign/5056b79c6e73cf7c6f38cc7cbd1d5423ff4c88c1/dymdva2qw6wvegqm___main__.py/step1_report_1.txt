{
  "purpose": "A command-line translation tool that takes input text and language parameters to output translated text using an imported 'translate' function.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv to obtain input text, target language, and optionally source language.",
  "sinks": "Uses the 'translate' function, which may process the input data and produce output. Also prints the usage information if arguments are insufficient.",
  "flows": "Input text and language parameters are read from sys.argv, then passed to the 'translate' function, and the result is printed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The usage string is benign. The 'translate' function is imported from a local module, which is typical for such tools.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a command-line interface for translation, with argument parsing and user guidance. There are no indications of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious behavior. The imported 'translate' function's implementation is unknown, but in this context, it appears to be a straightforward translation utility. No obfuscated code or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple translation CLI tool with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It relies on an external 'translate' function, but there are no suspicious behaviors or security concerns within this code snippet.",
