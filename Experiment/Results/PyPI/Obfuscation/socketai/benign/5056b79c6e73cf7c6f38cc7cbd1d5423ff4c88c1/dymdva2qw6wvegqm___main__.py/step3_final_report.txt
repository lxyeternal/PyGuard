  "purpose": "A command-line utility that takes input text, target language, and optionally source language, then calls an external translate function to perform translation.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (sys.argv) for input text, target language, and optional source language.",
  "sinks": "The translate function (imported from .core), which may perform network operations or data processing.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are read from sys.argv and passed directly to the translate function.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI wrapper around an external translate function. It validates input arguments, displays usage info if insufficient, and calls translate with the provided parameters. No network activity, secrets, or malicious code are visible. Variable names are obfuscated but this appears superficial. The core translation logic resides externally, so its behavior cannot be assessed here. No suspicious patterns or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign command-line translation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The superficial obfuscation does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on the external translate function, which appears to be a standard translation utility. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score around 0.2, and security risk score approximately 0.1, consistent with the analysis.",
