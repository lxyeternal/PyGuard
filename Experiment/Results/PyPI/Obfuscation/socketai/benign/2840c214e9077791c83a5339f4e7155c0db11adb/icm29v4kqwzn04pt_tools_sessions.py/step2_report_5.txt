  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and assessing the validity of their scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of utility functions and classes for Azure token management, filename sanitization, and file metadata handling.\n- It employs standard Azure SDKs (`azure.identity`, `azure.core.credentials`) and common Python libraries.\n- Variable names are obfuscated or unconventional, but this appears superficial and not necessarily malicious.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or malicious code patterns are evident.\n- The code is primarily for legitimate purposes: token retrieval, filename cleaning, and metadata parsing.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No suspicious behavior; standard Azure SDK usage; no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe report's conclusion aligns with the code. The obfuscation is superficial, and no malicious activity is evident. The low security risk score (0.2) is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** No signs of malware; superficial obfuscation; standard SDK usage; benign utility functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.2, Risk 0.1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nObfuscation is noted but deemed superficial. The malware score is zero, consistent with the analysis. The risk score is very low, fitting the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Legitimate Azure session management; no malicious activity; standard SDK calls.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe analysis matches the code. The obfuscation is minimal, and no malicious behavior is detected. The risk score is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous; standard Azure SDK usage; no malicious activity; no signs of malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0, Risk 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated variable names and string manipulations; some default values suspicious; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.3, Risk 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe obfuscation is slightly higher here, but the analysis correctly notes that it may be superficial. No malware or malicious behavior is identified. The risk score remains low.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Justification & Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which is justified. The code does not exhibit any malicious patterns such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Slightly higher in report 5 due to variable naming, but overall superficial. A score of around 0.2-0.3 is reasonable.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, the low risk scores (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate.\n\n**Potential discrepancies:**  \nNo report suggests any actual vulnerabilities or malicious intent. The only concern is superficial obfuscation, which does not translate into security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Expert Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** **0.0** — No evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** **0.2** — Slight obfuscation, but superficial.\n- **Risk Score:** **0.2** — Low, given the legitimate purpose and lack of vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent with the code's content. The code appears legitimate, with no malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate the security risk significantly.\n\n**Note:** If future code exhibits actual obfuscation or suspicious network activity, these scores should be revisited.",
