{
  "purpose": "The code manages Azure tokens via DefaultAzureCredential, sanitizes filenames, and handles file metadata, primarily for Azure session and file management utilities.",
  "sources": "Azure SDK calls for token retrieval, environment variables, data dictionaries for file properties.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or untrusted data flows; interactions are with SDKs and standard libraries; no network or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "Token source via DefaultAzureCredential -> token used for authentication; filename sanitized before use; metadata parsed from dicts -> used internally.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or complex but superficial; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns; filename sanitization minimal but sufficient.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard SDKs for Azure token management, with proper token refresh logic. Filename sanitization uses regex but is straightforward. Metadata class parses properties without issues. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or backdoors are present. Variable obfuscation appears superficial, likely stylistic. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected. The code's purpose aligns with legitimate Azure SDK utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, with no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. Overall security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
