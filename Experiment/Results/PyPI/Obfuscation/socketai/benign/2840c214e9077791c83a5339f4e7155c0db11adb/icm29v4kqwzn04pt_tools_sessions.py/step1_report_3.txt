{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement an Azure-based session management tool for dynamic sessions, providing authentication, file metadata handling, and interface with Azure services.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, package metadata, and API responses; retrieves tokens via Azure credentials; accesses file properties from dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Returns tokens and file metadata; interacts with Azure SDK functions; manipulates and processes data in various functions.",
  "flows": "Gets package version -> retrieves or refreshes Azure access token -> processes file metadata -> provides a tool class interface for invoking Azure session operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or secrets; code appears to be standard for Azure SDK usage and data processing. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names are detected. No network connections or data exfiltration evident within this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is structured around importing necessary modules, retrieving package version info, managing Azure credentials via DefaultAzureCredential, and defining utility functions and data classes. The function hExOlvTWWRHJusxnvdkIoFxtSUNAYJMX manages access tokens with expiration checks. The gCEurhpMqmtBEdappRXHeGuOxJFKhvmO function cleans input strings for potential command execution. The dataclass handles file metadata, and the class KMMgvsXXsUZMZWFpXwnGEGOwQUIMxpCU implements a tool interface with detailed docstrings. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a legitimate implementation of an Azure session management tool with appropriate token handling and file metadata operations. It contains no malware, malicious code, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
