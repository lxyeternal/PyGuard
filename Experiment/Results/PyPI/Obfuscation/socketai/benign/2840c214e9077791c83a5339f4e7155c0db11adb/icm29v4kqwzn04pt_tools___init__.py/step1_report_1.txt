  "purpose": "Import a class from a module within the langchain_azure_dynamic_sessions.tools.sessions package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from langchain_azure_dynamic_sessions.tools.sessions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks observed; import is static and controlled",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or source-to-sink paths; only static import",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbol name 'KMMgvsXXsUZMZWFpXwnGEGOwQUIMxpCU' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could indicate obfuscation or concealment of malicious intent; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific symbol from a module within a package. The symbol name is not descriptive and appears obfuscated, which is unusual and could be a tactic to hide malicious behavior or obfuscate malicious intent. The code does not perform any further actions, data processing, or network operations. The import statement itself is standard, but the obfuscated symbol name warrants caution. No suspicious control flow, data leakage, or malicious code execution is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an obfuscated symbol name. The obfuscation raises suspicion but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risk within this snippet alone. Further context would be necessary to determine intent definitively.",
