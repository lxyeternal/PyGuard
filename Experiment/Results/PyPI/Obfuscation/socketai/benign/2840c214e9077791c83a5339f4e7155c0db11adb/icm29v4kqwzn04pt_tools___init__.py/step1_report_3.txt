  "purpose": "Import a specific class from a module within the langchain_azure_dynamic_sessions package and expose it for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'KMMgvsXXsUZMZWFpXwnGEGOwQUIMxpCU' from a submodule.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or execute external data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The imported class name 'KMMgvsXXsUZMZWFpXwnGEGOwQUIMxpCU' appears to be a randomly generated string, which may indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide the true purpose of the class. No other suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of a class with an obfuscated name from a module in a package related to langchain and Azure sessions. The list __all__ indicates that only this class is intended for external use. There are no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior observed. The only concern is the obfuscated class name, which could be used to conceal malicious intent or functionality, but no further code is provided to evaluate that.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and only performs an import and export declaration. The obfuscated class name warrants caution, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this fragment. Overall, low confidence in malicious intent based solely on this snippet.",
