  "purpose": "Import a symbol from an obfuscated module and expose a specific name via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'langchain_azure_dynamic_sessions.tools.sessions' module, specifically the symbol 'KMMgvsXXsUZMZWFpXwnGEGOwQUIMxpCU'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "The import source flows into the local namespace; no further data flow or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name 'KMMgvsXXsUZMZWFpXwnGEGOwQUIMxpCU' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a static import of an obfuscated symbol and exposes a string in __all__. No dynamic behavior, network activity, or malicious code is evident. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not, by itself, indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.75, risk=0.2) are consistent with the minimal evidence of malicious activity, with obfuscation being a cautionary flag. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious operations suggest a benign purpose, but obfuscation warrants further review if additional context is available.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import with an obfuscated symbol name. No evidence of malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation raises suspicion. The current scores are appropriate; further investigation should be conducted if more context is provided.",
