  "purpose": "Import a class from an obfuscated module and define the module's export list.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'KMMgvsXXsUZMZWFpXwnGEGOwQUIMxpCU' from 'langchain_azure_dynamic_sessions.tools.sessions'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network or file operations present.",
  "flows": "Import of the class, no data flow beyond module import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name 'KMMgvsXXsUZMZWFpXwnGEGOwQUIMxpCU' suggests obfuscation; the '__all__' list contains 'SessionsPythonREPLTool' which does not match the imported class name, indicating inconsistency or potential misconfiguration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class with a suspicious, obfuscated name, which is a red flag for potential malicious intent or concealment. The '__all__' list specifies a different name, possibly indicating an error or intentional obfuscation. The minimal code provides no evidence of malicious behavior but the obfuscated class name warrants further inspection. Scores assigned in reports reflect high suspicion due to obfuscation (0.7-0.8), but low malware likelihood (0.2-0.3) given the lack of active malicious code. The inconsistency between the imported class and the export list should be investigated further to confirm intent. Overall, the code appears benign but suspicious, requiring additional source review of the class implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains an obfuscated class name and an inconsistent export list, raising suspicion but no direct evidence of malicious activity. The scores are appropriate, with high obfuscation and low malware likelihood. Further review of the class source is recommended before deployment or trust.",
