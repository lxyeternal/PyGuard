  "purpose": "Import a specific class from a third-party module within the langchain_azure_dynamic_sessions package, and define exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'langchain_azure_dynamic_sessions.tools.sessions' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output points",
  "flows": "The imported class is not used or manipulated further in this code snippet; no data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly random or obfuscated class name 'KMMgvsXXsUZMZWFpXwnGEGOwQUIMxpCU' which appears to be non-descriptive and potentially obfuscated",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class with a non-descriptive, likely obfuscated name from a module within a package. The only operation is defining the __all__ list to specify the module's public interface. No data processing, no user input handling, and no suspicious network or file operations are present. The unusual class name could suggest obfuscation or a generated identifier, but without further context, it cannot be definitively malicious. The code itself is minimal and does not execute any logic beyond import and export declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is minimal and primarily serves to re-export an imported class. The obfuscated class name warrants caution but does not, in isolation, indicate malicious behavior. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
