  "purpose": "Import a specific class from a module within the langchain_azure_dynamic_sessions.tools.sessions package and define the exported symbol.",
  "sources": "The import statement from 'langchain_azure_dynamic_sessions.tools.sessions' and the __all__ list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data are present; no data leakage or malicious data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports a class and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly random or obfuscated class name 'KMMgvsXXsUZMZWFpXwnGEGOwQUIMxpCU', which could be intentional or suspicious. The code is minimal and does not include any functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name from a specific module path, then sets an __all__ list for export. There is no further logic, data handling, or network activity. The unusual class name could indicate obfuscation or intentionally hidden behavior, but given the minimal context, it is not inherently malicious. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions or contain obvious backdoors or secrets.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import and export declaration with an obfuscated class name. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this fragment alone. The unusual class name warrants further context review, but within this snippet, the risk appears low.",
