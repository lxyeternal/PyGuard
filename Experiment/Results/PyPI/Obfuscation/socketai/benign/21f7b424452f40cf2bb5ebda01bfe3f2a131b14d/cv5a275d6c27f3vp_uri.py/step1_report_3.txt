{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a complex URL or URI parsing and construction utility, likely for managing identifiers following a specific schema (possibly FRBR URIs). It includes methods for generating and parsing these URIs with various components.",
  "sources": "Reads input data primarily from object attributes and method parameters; no direct external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks such as network, filesystem, or environment variables; the code does not perform I/O operations or network communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows are mostly internal within object methods, transforming attributes into URI strings and vice versa; no external untrusted data flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains overly complex class and method structures with seemingly unnecessary dynamic attribute handling, but no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. The regex is for pattern matching URIs and does not perform malicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a URL/URI parsing class with methods to generate, parse, and represent URIs following a specific pattern. No external data input or output sources are used in a malicious manner. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations. The complexity of methods appears to serve schema parsing and construction without malicious intent. The regex is a well-formed pattern for URI validation, not obfuscated or malicious. Overall, the code functions as a utility for URI handling with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a URI handling utility with no signs of malware or malicious intent. It performs schema parsing and construction without external data leaks or harmful operations. No security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
