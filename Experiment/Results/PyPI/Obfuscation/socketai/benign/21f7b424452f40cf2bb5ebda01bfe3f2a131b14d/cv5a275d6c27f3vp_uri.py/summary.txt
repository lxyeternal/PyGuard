  "conclusion": "The code is a benign URI utility class with complex regex and obfuscated naming but no malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The reports' assessments and scores are consistent with the code's behavior."
