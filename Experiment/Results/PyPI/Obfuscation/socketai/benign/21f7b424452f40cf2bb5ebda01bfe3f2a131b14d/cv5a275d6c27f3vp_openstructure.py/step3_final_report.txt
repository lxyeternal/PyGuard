{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple classes inheriting from an imported class, each containing static string attributes with obfuscated or nonsensical names, serving likely as constants or identifiers without active logic.",
  "sources": "Import from '.akn'; static class attributes",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow, network, or external data handling",
  "flows": "None; static data only",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no functions or data processing; static string attributes with arbitrary values",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with static string attributes, no functions, data flow, or external interactions. Obfuscation is evident through nonsensical names, which may be an attempt at concealment. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The static nature and obfuscation suggest it may serve as configuration or constants, but without active behavior, it poses minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and obfuscated class definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent based solely on this snippet.",
