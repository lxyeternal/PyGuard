{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to configure and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' library.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply calls 'setup()' with no arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, using only the basic 'setup()' call without parameters, which is typical in a package's setup script; no anomalies or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and immediately calls 'setup()' with default parameters. This pattern is common in Python package setup files. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, network activity, or obfuscated elements. It appears to be a standard, benign setup script with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, minimal setup script for a Python package. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
