  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code merely calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, standard, and does not contain hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "This script imports the setup function from setuptools and invokes it with default parameters. It is a typical minimal setup script for packaging Python projects. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious logic, or suspicious data handling. Since it performs a standard package setup with no additional logic, it presents no security risks or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
