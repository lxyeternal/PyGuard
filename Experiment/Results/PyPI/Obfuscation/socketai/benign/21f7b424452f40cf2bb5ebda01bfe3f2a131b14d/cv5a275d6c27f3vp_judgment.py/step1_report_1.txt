{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class hierarchy related to 'judgment' structures and labels, likely for organizing or processing such data.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .akn module; class attribute definitions that assign string labels.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code mainly sets class attributes with static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, or suspicious behaviors; no obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol from a relative module, then defines a class that inherits from it. The class has static string attributes related to 'judgment' structures. A second class extends the first and adds another string attribute. The structure appears to be data organization or labeling, with no dynamic code, input handling, or external data processing. No indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior are present. The code's purpose seems to be defining data labels or structures, which is common in data modeling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, primarily defining data-related classes with static attributes. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain compromise, or security risks within this snippet.",
