{
  "purpose": "Static class definitions representing judgment-related data labels with obfuscated class and attribute names.",
  "sources": "Import from local module `.akn`; class inheritance and static string attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data input, external communication, or dynamic code execution present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static attribute assignments without external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; no functions or dynamic code; static strings only.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions with static string attributes related to judgment structures. No functions, data processing, or external interactions are present. Obfuscation is noted but is common in auto-generated or protected code and does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The import from `.akn` could be suspicious if malicious, but no evidence supports this. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is high but not malicious; security risk is minimal. The code appears to serve as data labels or configuration, with no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static data structure definitions with obfuscated naming, and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk from this snippet is low.",
