{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define class structures with attribute assignments, possibly related to judicial or legal data models.",
  "sources": "The code imports a function or class from a relative module '.akn' and assigns string literals to class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data input or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code mainly defines class structures with static string values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior are present. The import statement from a relative module could be unusual depending on context, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol from a local module, defines a subclass extending this imported class with a class attribute, and then defines another subclass extending the previous class with an additional attribute. All attributes are assigned fixed string literals related to judgments. There are no inputs, outputs, network activity, or suspicious operations. The code appears to serve as data modeling or configuration structure without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward class inheritance with static attribute values, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, malware, or security concerns based on the provided snippet.",
