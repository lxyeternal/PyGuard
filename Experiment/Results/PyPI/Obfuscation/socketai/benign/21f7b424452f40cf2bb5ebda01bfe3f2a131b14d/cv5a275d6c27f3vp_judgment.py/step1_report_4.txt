  "purpose": "Define classes related to judgment structures and bodies, possibly for legal or document processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.akn'; class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The class names and attribute names appear obfuscated or auto-generated, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a local module. It then defines a subclass that inherits from this imported class, adding two class attributes with descriptive names but seemingly arbitrary string values. A further subclass extends the previous class with an additional attribute. The structure appears to be a typical class inheritance pattern. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The naming conventions suggest obfuscation or code auto-generation, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward class inheritance setup with obfuscated class and attribute names. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious data handling, or security risks detected based on this snippet.",
