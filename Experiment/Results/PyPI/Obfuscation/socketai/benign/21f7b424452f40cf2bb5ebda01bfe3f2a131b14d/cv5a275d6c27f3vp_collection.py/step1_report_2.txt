{
  "purpose": "Define classes related to collection structures, documents, and official gazettes, likely for data organization.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .akn module, class attribute assignments",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, code execution, or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flows from sources to sinks; class attributes are static strings",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and attribute names, no meaningful method logic, no input handling or data processing, no external communication, no secrets or credentials",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a relative module, then defines subclasses that inherit behavior from it. All class attributes are static strings with non-descriptive names, possibly obfuscated. There are no methods, no input parsing, no network operations, and no suspicious logic. The code appears to serve as a data schema or structured constants. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior are evident. The obfuscation seems intentional, but it does not necessarily imply malicious intent; it might be for code obscurity or code generation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple class hierarchy with obfuscated names, used for data organization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The overall risk is very low.",
