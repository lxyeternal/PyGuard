  "purpose": "Define class hierarchies with specific string attributes related to collection types",
  "sources": "Class inheritance and attribute assignments",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external output handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; attribute values are hardcoded strings",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and attribute names; no clear functionality; code appears intentionally obscure",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and defines three classes that inherit from each other. The attribute values are static strings related to collection or document types, which could be part of a larger framework. There are no external inputs, network calls, or suspicious operations. The obfuscated naming may suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but on its own, this is not malicious. The lack of dynamic behavior, input handling, or system interaction reduces concern for malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be intentionally obfuscated class and attribute definitions without any malicious behavior. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The obfuscation may be for proprietary reasons or to obscure purpose, but there are no security risks or malware indicators based solely on this fragment.",
