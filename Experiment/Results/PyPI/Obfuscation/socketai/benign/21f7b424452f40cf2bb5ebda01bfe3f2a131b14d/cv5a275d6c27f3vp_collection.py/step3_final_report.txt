{
  "purpose": "Defines obfuscated classes with static string attributes, likely serving as data structures or configuration schemas.",
  "sources": "Static attribute assignments within classes; no external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external systems, no external communication or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "None; static class attributes without dynamic data or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; absence of functions or dynamic logic; purely structural code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module and defines three classes with obfuscated names, each containing static string attributes. No functions, input handling, network activity, or data processing are present. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not imply malicious intent. All indicators point to structural data or configuration code. No suspicious behaviors, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not increase security risk. The malware score remains zero, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as structural or configuration data with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities are present. The supply chain security posture based on this fragment is very low risk.",
