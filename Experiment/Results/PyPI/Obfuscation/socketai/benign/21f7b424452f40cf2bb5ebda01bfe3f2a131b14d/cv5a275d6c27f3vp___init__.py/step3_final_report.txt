{
  "purpose": "This code defines and exports classes and constants related to structured legal or legislative documents, primarily through static import statements from internal modules. It also sets a version string and specifies the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Local module imports with heavily obfuscated class and function names, and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external network connections, or dynamic data processing are present.",
  "flows": "Static import statements establish source-to-sink paths; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and function names, the presence of a version string that is unused, and the lack of descriptive identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from internal modules with obfuscated names, serving as a module interface or API surface. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are observable. The obfuscation may be intentional for concealment or a result of code generation. The version string is assigned but not utilized elsewhere. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity, are present. The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but do not indicate malicious intent based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a structural module setup with heavily obfuscated internal names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks in this snippet. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules' contents, but based on this code alone, the security risk is minimal.",
