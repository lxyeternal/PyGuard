{
  "purpose": "The code defines a dataclass with several boolean and integer fields, along with a method that resets a specific attribute based on another boolean attribute.",
  "sources": "The class attributes are set or modified internally; no external input sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "The method modifies the attribute 'oiYHKKFgQZtBYacHucFPxthFxwFSWyIQ' based on 'BIkypnGdPAmMQuRgCfNQkTLlnyrkBkxT', but no external data sinks or outputs are directly present.",
  "flows": "The method flow is straightforward: if 'BIkypnGdPAmMQuRgCfNQkTLlnyrkBkxT' is False, then 'oiYHKKFgQZtBYacHucFPxthFxwFSWyIQ' is set to 0.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The class and method perform simple attribute management with no external interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple data structure with a method to reset an attribute conditionally. No external inputs, network calls, or system modifications are present. No obfuscation or malicious code behaviors are detected. The naming appears obfuscated but may be auto-generated or deliberately unclear; however, that alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a data container with a basic conditional method. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
