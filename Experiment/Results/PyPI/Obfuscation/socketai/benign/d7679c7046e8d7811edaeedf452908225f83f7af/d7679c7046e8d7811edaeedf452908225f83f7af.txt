The import from 'flynt.cli' is legitimate, but the obfuscated identifiers warrant further inspection. The overall security risk remains low, but caution is advised, especially regarding the imported module. The malware likelihood is low, and no active malicious behavior is detected."

The high obfuscation score is justified by the naming conventions and import patterns, but the overall behavior is benign. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2)."

The obfuscation may be for proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. Given the lack of active malicious signals, the overall assessment is that this code is benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation and potential for misuse."

While no explicit malicious actions are confirmed, the risk is high enough to warrant caution and further investigation into the function's actual behavior."

Its obfuscation could be exploited to hide malicious payloads, but in its current form, it appears benign. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.7), and the security risk is low (~0.3). Vigilance is advised if used in untrusted contexts."
