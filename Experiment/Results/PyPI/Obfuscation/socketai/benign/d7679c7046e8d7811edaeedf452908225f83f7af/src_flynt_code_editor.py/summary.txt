  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, code transformation utility with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The high obfuscation score is justified by the naming conventions and import patterns, but the overall behavior is benign. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2)."
