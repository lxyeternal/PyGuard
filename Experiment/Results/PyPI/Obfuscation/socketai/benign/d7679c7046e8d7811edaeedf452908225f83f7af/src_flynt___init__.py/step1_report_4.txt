{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting a version string and importing a function or module from the 'flynt.cli' package, then defining __all__ for module exports.",
  "sources": "Assignment to variable 'yyERnWYhkhhtHZnvtSydnXqlWQrOkqrW' and import statement from 'flynt.cli'.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could potentially be a sink if 'jfQemoIaIiCEVstSwlJgULSNbUFvKjTo' is untrusted or malicious, but in itself, it is a standard import.",
  "flows": "No complex data flow present; the version string is assigned locally, and the import is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'yyERnWYhkhhtHZnvtSydnXqlWQrOkqrW' which appears random or obfuscated, but no actual obfuscated code or malicious behavior is evident. The imported module name 'jfQemoIaIiCEVstSwlJgULSNbUFvKjTo' also looks obfuscated or auto-generated, which can be suspicious but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports from a potentially obfuscated module name. The variable name and imported module name look unusual, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The import might be from an external package, but without malicious intent. Overall, the code is minimal and does not exhibit malicious patterns or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, with obfuscated-looking identifiers but no clear malicious behavior or security threats. The unusual naming could indicate obfuscation but does not, by itself, suggest malicious intent.",
