{
  "purpose": "Assign a version string to an obfuscated variable and import a potentially obfuscated function/module from 'flynt.cli', then expose 'main' and '__version__' in __all__.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string assignment; importing from 'flynt.cli'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are present; no data leaks or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "N/A — minimal code with no data flow or external output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; import from 'flynt.cli' with non-descriptive identifiers; no apparent reason for obfuscation in this context.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable, imports a function or module with an obfuscated name from 'flynt.cli', and defines __all__ with 'main' and '__version__'. The import source 'flynt.cli' is a legitimate package related to code formatting, reducing suspicion. However, the obfuscated identifiers are suspicious and could be used to conceal malicious behavior. No malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code execution is evident. The minimal nature of the code suggests low risk, but the obfuscation warrants caution. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscated ~0.6-0.7, security risk ~0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the evidence. Further review of the imported module and the broader context is recommended before deployment.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is minimally suspicious due to obfuscation but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The import from 'flynt.cli' is legitimate, but the obfuscated identifiers warrant further inspection. The overall security risk remains low, but caution is advised, especially regarding the imported module. The malware likelihood is low, and no active malicious behavior is detected.",
