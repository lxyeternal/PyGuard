{
  "purpose": "Defines a version string and imports a potentially obfuscated or non-standard module from 'flynt.cli'. Exposes 'main' and '__version__' in the module's public API.",
  "sources": "The string assignment 'yyERnWYhkhhtHZnvtSydnXqlWQrOkqrW' and the import statement from 'flynt.cli'.",
  "sinks": "The import from 'flynt.cli' could potentially be a sink if the imported module is malicious or obfuscated, but as is, it is just a normal import.",
  "flows": "The version string is assigned without external input. The imported module could potentially execute code upon import, which may be a source-to-sink flow if malicious.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'yyERnWYhkhhtHZnvtSydnXqlWQrOkqrW' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be suspicious. The import from 'flynt.cli' is standard, but the module name could be obfuscated or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string with a non-standard variable name, possibly obfuscated. It then imports from 'flynt.cli', which could be a legitimate module or could be malicious if the package is compromised or if the module itself is malicious. No code is executed directly besides the import. The presence of an obfuscated variable name and an import from a potentially suspicious module raises concerns about obfuscation or malicious intent. No other suspicious behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data leaks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears minimal and largely benign, but the obfuscated variable name and the import from 'flynt.cli' without further context could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. The import could execute malicious code if the module is compromised. Overall, the risk is low but warrants caution due to obfuscation and lack of transparency.",
