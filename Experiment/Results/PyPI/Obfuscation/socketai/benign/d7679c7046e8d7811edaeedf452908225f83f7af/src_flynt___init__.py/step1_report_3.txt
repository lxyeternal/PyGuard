  "purpose": "Defines a version string and imports a function from the 'flynt.cli' module, exposing 'main' and '__version__'.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment and the import statement.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could potentially execute or import malicious code if 'flynt.cli' is compromised, but there is no direct sink for untrusted data here.",
  "flows": "The module assigns a version string, then imports a potentially external function from 'flynt.cli'. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'yyERnWYhkhhtHZnvtSydnXqlWQrOkqrW' is nonsensical, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated. The imported function 'jfQemoIaIiCEVstSwlJgULSNbUFvKjTo' has an obfuscated name, which is unusual and could hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string with a seemingly random variable name, then imports a function with an obfuscated name from 'flynt.cli'. The __all__ list indicates exported symbols 'main' and '__version__'. The import could execute code from 'flynt.cli', which is standard, but the obfuscated function name raises suspicion about concealment. There are no visible sources of untrusted input or obvious malicious behaviors like network calls or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "While the code itself is minimal, the presence of obfuscated variable and function names, combined with the import from a possibly external or compromised module, raises suspicion. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation warrants caution. The code appears intentionally obscured but does not demonstrate malicious behavior outright.",
