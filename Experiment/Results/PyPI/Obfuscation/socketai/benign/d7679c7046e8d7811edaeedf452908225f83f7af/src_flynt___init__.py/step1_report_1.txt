{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a package version and import a specific module from the 'flynt.cli' package, likely related to code formatting or CLI utilities.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version string assignment and the import statement from 'flynt.cli'.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could potentially execute code or lead to dynamic execution if 'flynt.cli' or its functions contain malicious code, but as written, it does not appear to do so directly.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are explicitly visible; the import could invoke code upon import, but there's no direct malicious activity indicated.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'jfQemoIaIiCEVstSwlJgULSNbUFvKjTo' is obfuscated and appears to be a non-meaningful identifier, which is suspicious. The variable name 'yyERnWYhkhhtHZnvtSydnXqlWQrOkqrW' is also obfuscated. These suggest possible obfuscation or concealment of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and imports an obfuscated module from 'flynt.cli'. The obfuscated variable names and import suggest an attempt to conceal the actual functionality, which is suspicious. Without additional code, it is unclear what the imported module does, but the obfuscation raises concerns. There is no explicit malicious activity or data leakage in this fragment, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated identifiers and a straightforward import statement, which could be used to conceal malicious functionality. However, no direct malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment alone. Due to obfuscation, further review of the imported module is recommended before deployment.",
