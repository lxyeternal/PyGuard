  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of comments or documentation. It appears to perform some operations involving data processing, but the exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'input_data' variable and potentially from environment variables or external files if used, though no explicit input sources are shown in the snippet provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'exec', 'eval', or system calls if present, or data being written to files or network sockets. However, the specific sinks are not clearly visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input variables or external sources through processing functions and may reach sensitive functions like execution or network transmission commands, if present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or backdoors are evident. The code contains some dynamic features, but nothing that clearly indicates malicious intent. The code structure appears standard, with no unusual language features or misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks with no visible signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network connections to suspicious domains. It does not appear to contain obfuscated or malicious payloads. There are no clear source-to-sink flows that suggest exploitation or malicious activity. Without additional context or hidden code, the likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, functioning as a typical data processing script without any suspicious or harmful operations.",
