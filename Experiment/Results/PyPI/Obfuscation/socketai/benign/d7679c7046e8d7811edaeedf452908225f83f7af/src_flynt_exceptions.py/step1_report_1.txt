  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present",
  "anomalies": "All classes are custom exceptions with obscure, non-descriptive names; no functional code or logic present; no input/output handling or external interactions",
  "analysis": "The code only declares three custom exception classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. These classes inherit from each other, with no methods or behavior. There is no evidence of data reading, processing, or external communication. The class names suggest obfuscation, but no malicious behavior or suspicious patterns are evident. The structure is minimal and typical of placeholder or obfuscated code, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple declaration of custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for internal use or as part of a larger codebase. There is no indication of malicious intent, data leakage, or security risks. The code itself does not perform any harmful actions or exhibit malicious patterns.",
