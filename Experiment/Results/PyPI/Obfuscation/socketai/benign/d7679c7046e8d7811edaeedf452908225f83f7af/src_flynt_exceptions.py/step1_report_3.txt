{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes, likely for specialized error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class declarations and inheritance hierarchy; no input reading or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling mechanisms; no untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; classes are merely defined with inheritance relationships.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, seemingly randomized class names; no functional code or logic; no apparent security issues or malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from a custom exception class, with no additional logic, input handling, or external interactions. The class names appear obfuscated or randomly generated but do not indicate malicious intent. The structure is consistent with defining custom exceptions, a common practice in Python. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code appears benign and serves as a part of a larger error handling framework.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious activity, security risks, or anomalous behavior. It appears to be a benign part of an error handling scheme.",
