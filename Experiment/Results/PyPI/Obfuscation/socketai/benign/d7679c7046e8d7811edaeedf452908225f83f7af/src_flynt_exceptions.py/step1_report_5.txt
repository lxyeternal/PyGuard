{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present in the code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths are present",
  "anomalies": "The code only declares classes inheriting from Exception without additional logic; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code are present",
  "analysis": "The code creates three custom exception classes, two of which inherit from the base custom exception class, which itself inherits from Exception. There is no data input, external calls, or complex logic. The structure is straightforward and standard for custom exception definitions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple class declarations for custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or external communication. Overall, the code is benign.",
