{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes, likely for error handling or control flow within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; the code only declares classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, output, or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; just class declarations without methods or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Classes are named with obfuscated, non-descriptive identifiers; no behavior or logic beyond class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three custom exception classes, two of which inherit from a base exception class. All class names are obfuscated, which can be a red flag but also can be used for internal code. There are no functions, data processing, external interactions, or suspicious logic. The code does not contain malicious patterns such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation alone is not sufficient evidence of malicious intent but warrants caution. Overall, the code appears to be harmless, possibly intentionally obfuscated for obfuscation's sake or for internal use.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines obfuscated exception classes with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The obfuscated class names might be suspicious, but there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment.",
