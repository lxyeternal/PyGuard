{
  "purpose": "The code defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely serving as placeholders or internal error types.",
  "sources": "Class declarations with obfuscated class names inheriting from Exception.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external interactions, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Class inheritance from Exception; no data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names with no descriptive identifiers; minimal code structure; no methods or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from Exception, with no methods, data processing, or external interactions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, network activity, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears to be solely in naming, which could be for internal purposes or placeholder code. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the obfuscation score is high due to the non-descriptive class names. The security risk score remains very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The confidence in this assessment is high, given the simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated exception class declarations with no malicious intent or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall, the security risk remains very low. No evidence suggests malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
