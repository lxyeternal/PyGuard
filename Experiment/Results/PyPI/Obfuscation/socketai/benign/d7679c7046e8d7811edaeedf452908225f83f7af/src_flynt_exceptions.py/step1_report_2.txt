{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, likely for handling specific error conditions in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; class definitions are static and do not process external data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are only definitions without behavior or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names that are non-descriptive and appear obfuscated; no comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception classes with obfuscated names, all inheriting from the base Exception class. There are no methods, data processing, external input/output, or other behaviors. The class names are non-descriptive and seem intentionally obscured, which could be an obfuscation technique. However, there is no evidence of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network access, or harmful behavior. The code appears to be standard class declarations with no operational impact beyond defining exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and only defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks present. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent but could be part of an obfuscation strategy.",
