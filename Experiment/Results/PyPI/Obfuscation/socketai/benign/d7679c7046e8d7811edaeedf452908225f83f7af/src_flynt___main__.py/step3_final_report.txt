  "purpose": "Import a function with an obfuscated name from the 'flynt' package and execute it immediately, then exit.",
  "sources": "Import statement of 'jfQemoIaIiCEVstSwlJgULSNbUFvKjTo' from 'flynt'.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() called with the function's return value, potentially executing malicious payloads or terminating the process.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated function -> call to function -> sys.exit() with its output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name, immediate execution and termination, use of a legitimate package in an unusual context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a seemingly random, obfuscated function from 'flynt', a legitimate formatting library, then calls it and exits immediately. The pattern of obfuscation combined with immediate execution is suspicious and typical of malicious scripts aiming to hide payloads. The lack of source code for the function prevents definitive analysis, but the pattern warrants high suspicion. The obfuscation score is justified at 0.9, and the malware score should be elevated to 0.75 to reflect potential malicious intent. The security risk score should also be high, around 0.75, due to the obfuscation and execution pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code pattern suggests obfuscated malicious intent, primarily due to the nonsensical function name, immediate execution, and use of a legitimate library in an unusual manner. While no explicit malicious actions are confirmed, the risk is high enough to warrant caution and further investigation into the function's actual behavior.",
