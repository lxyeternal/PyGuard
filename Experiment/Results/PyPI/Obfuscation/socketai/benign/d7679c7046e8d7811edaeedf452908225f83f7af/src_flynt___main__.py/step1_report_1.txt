  "purpose": "The code imports a module named 'flynt' and executes a function from it, then terminates the program.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'flynt' and the call to 'jfQemoIaIiCEVstSwlJgULSNbUFvKjTo()' function.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() call with the return value of the function, which may affect program termination.",
  "flows": "Import 'flynt' -> Call 'jfQemoIaIiCEVstSwlJgULSNbUFvKjTo()' -> sys.exit() with returned value.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'jfQemoIaIiCEVstSwlJgULSNbUFvKjTo' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, suggesting possible malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party module 'flynt', which is a legitimate tool for Python formatting. However, the function called within 'flynt' has a nonsensical, obfuscated name, which is suspicious. The code executes this function and immediately exits with its return value, which could be malicious if the function performs malicious actions or returns malicious data. The import is straightforward but the function name is unusual and potentially malicious or obfuscated. No other malicious code or suspicious behavior is present, but the obfuscated function name is a significant concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code imports a legitimate library but calls an obfuscated function and exits immediately. The obfuscated function name and direct execution pattern raise suspicion about malicious intent or obfuscation, though no explicit malicious actions are visible. Caution is advised due to the suspicious function name.",
