  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI wrapper for 'flynt' with significant obfuscation. No active malicious behavior or supply chain attack indicators are evident. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but based on static analysis, the likelihood of malware is very low."
