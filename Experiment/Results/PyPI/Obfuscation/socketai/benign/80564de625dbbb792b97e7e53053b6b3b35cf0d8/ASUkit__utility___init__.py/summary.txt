  "conclusion": "The dependency code appears benign in most cases, with the notable exception of obfuscated segments in report 5, which warrant attention but do not confirm malicious activity. The low malware and security risk scores are justified, with the obfuscation score appropriately high. Overall, supply chain security is low risk, though obfuscation should be monitored."
