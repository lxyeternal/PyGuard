{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup configuration script for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, package data, and entry points using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata parameters within the setup() function, including package data, dependencies, and maintainer info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "The setup() call initializes package configuration without dynamic data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names replacing standard parameter names, an empty console_scripts list, and non-standard parameter naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script with obfuscated parameter names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscation may be superficial or placeholder, but it warrants caution. The maintainer email appears legitimate, and dependencies are standard scientific packages. The absence of malicious code, backdoors, or active payloads suggests a benign intent, though obfuscation could be used to hide malicious activity. Static analysis indicates a low malware risk, but the obfuscation raises minor suspicion. Scores are consistent with these observations.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No active malicious behavior or security risks are detected from static analysis. The obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring, but overall, the package appears safe.",
