  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package for distribution with metadata, package data, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Static data within the setup() function call, such as package name, version, maintainer email, package data, classifiers, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through the maintainer email; no other sinks present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows are evident. Static configuration data is used without dynamic or untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., ZAgZmJJcZSvHobgcHENZyEvDBzlcPoEc) replacing expected parameter names, which may suggest obfuscation or attempt to hide intent. The empty console_scripts entry point may indicate incomplete or malicious intent, but is not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with typical metadata and configuration. The presence of obfuscated-looking variable names replacing expected parameter names could suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate malicious code. However, all the data appears to be static, with no dynamic code execution or untrusted input handling. The maintainer email appears legitimate, and dependencies are standard scientific packages. The empty console_scripts entry point is unusual but not malicious per se. Overall, the code seems to serve a legitimate purpose but uses obfuscated variable names that could be suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup with some obfuscation in variable naming. No active malicious behavior or malicious code is evident. The only notable concern is the obfuscation, which warrants caution, but the code itself appears benign.",
