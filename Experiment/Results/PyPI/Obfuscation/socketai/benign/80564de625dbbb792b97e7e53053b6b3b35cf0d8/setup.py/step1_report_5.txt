{
  "purpose": "Define and configure a Python package setup with metadata, package data, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The package data, maintainer email, dependencies, and entry points are read from the code.",
  "sinks": "None of the data flows appear to lead to untrusted external sources or pose security risks.",
  "flows": "Input data such as package data and dependencies are processed internally; no untrusted data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names with random strings and the absence of meaningful entry points or scripts; no actual executable code or malicious payload present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup configuration using setuptools with obfuscated variable names. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The setup specifies package metadata, dependencies, and package data, all typical for Python packaging. The empty console_scripts entry point suggests no executable script is defined, reducing risk. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
