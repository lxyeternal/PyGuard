  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could indicate obfuscation. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name and a version string. There are no inputs, no external data reads, no function calls, or network activity. The variable name is unusual but not inherently malicious. No suspicious patterns or code injections are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple version string assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
