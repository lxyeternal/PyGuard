  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is likely legitimate scientific software performing structure and diffraction calculations. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or sabotage. The scores assigned are consistent with the static analysis, with a high obfuscation score and zero malware risk. Continuous monitoring and contextual review are recommended if sourced from untrusted origins."
