  "conclusion": "The code is primarily scientific data processing with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or sabotage. The obfuscation is likely for proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. The malware score is low (around 0.1–0.2), and the security risk is also low (around 0.2). The obfuscation score is high (around 0.75), reflecting variable naming and complex manipulations. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, but ongoing vigilance regarding obfuscation is recommended."
