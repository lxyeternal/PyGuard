      "conclusion": "The code is primarily scientific data processing with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, network activity, or sabotage. The obfuscation is likely for proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. The malware score is low (around 0.1–0.2), and the security risk is also low (around 0.2). The obfuscation score is high (around 0.75), reflecting variable naming and complex manipulations. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, but ongoing vigilance regarding obfuscation is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. The current scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.4-0.8), and security risk is 0."

      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is likely legitimate scientific software performing structure and diffraction calculations. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or sabotage. The scores assigned are consistent with the static analysis, with a high obfuscation score and zero malware risk. Continuous monitoring and contextual review are recommended if sourced from untrusted origins."

      "conclusion": "The dependency code appears benign in most cases, with the notable exception of obfuscated segments in report 5, which warrant attention but do not confirm malicious activity. The low malware and security risk scores are justified, with the obfuscation score appropriately high. Overall, supply chain security is low risk, though obfuscation should be monitored."

The obfuscation likely aims to protect proprietary algorithms or intellectual property. There is no evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious sabotage, and the security risk is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and align with the detailed analysis."
