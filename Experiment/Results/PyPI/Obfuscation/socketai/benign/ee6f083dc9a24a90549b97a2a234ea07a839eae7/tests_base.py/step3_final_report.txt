  "purpose": "Compare YAML files in two directories for data equality by loading and asserting their contents.",
  "sources": "Directory listings via Path().rglob('*.yaml'), data loaded through the undefined _load_tuple_data function.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that compare loaded data, which could cause denial of service if input data is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Listing YAML files -> loading data with _load_tuple_data -> asserting equality between corresponding data entries.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for validation, which can be exploited to cause crashes; the function _load_tuple_data is undefined, introducing uncertainty.",
  "analysis": "The code performs directory traversal, loads YAML data, and compares entries for equality. No network activity or suspicious code is present. The main concern is the use of assertions on untrusted data, which could be exploited for denial of service. The undefined _load_tuple_data function warrants caution, as it could contain malicious code, but no evidence of malicious behavior is present in the snippet. Obfuscated function names are noted but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears benign with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a straightforward YAML comparison utility with low security risk. The primary concern is the reliance on assertions and the undefined data loading function, which should be reviewed for safety. No malicious activity is evident.",
