  "purpose": "The code compares YAML files in two directories by loading their contents and asserting that their data matches.",
  "sources": "Path traversal via `Path(a).rglob('*.yaml')` and `Path(b).rglob('*.yaml')`, reading YAML files and loading their contents.",
  "sinks": "Assertions that compare loaded data to ensure equality; if data does not match, an AssertionError is raised.",
  "flows": "Directory traversal -> YAML file listing -> File loading -> Data comparison and assertion.",
  "anomalies": "Use of assertions for data validation; no obvious malicious code, but assertions can be exploited if inputs are malicious (e.g., causing assertion failures or side effects). No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code lists YAML files from two directories, asserts equal file counts, then loads each YAML file pair and asserts their contents are identical. Uses `Path.rglob` for recursive file search, loads YAML data, and compares data element-wise. No malicious or suspicious code is detected; the assertions serve as a consistency check. No data leakage, code injection, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not interact with network, environment variables, or perform any file modifications beyond reading.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward comparison of YAML files in two directories to verify data consistency. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Usage of assertions for validation is common but can be misused if input data is malicious; however, no malicious intent is evident.",
