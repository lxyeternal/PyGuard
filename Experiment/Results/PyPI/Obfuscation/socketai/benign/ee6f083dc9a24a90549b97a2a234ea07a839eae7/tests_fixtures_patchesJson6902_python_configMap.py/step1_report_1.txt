  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python script or package intended for general functionality, possibly including some form of data processing or utility operations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, file systems, or user input (if present). Specific data sources are not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or environment modifications. Without explicit code, no definitive sink is identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system). The exact flow paths are not explicitly visible in the snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual behaviors are evident. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward implementation without suspicious patterns. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries is standard, and no unsafe code practices are detected. Lack of explicit network activity or credential handling reduces concern. The code structure is clear, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems safe for use. However, this analysis assumes no hidden or external malicious components not visible in the snippet.",
