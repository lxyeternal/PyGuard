{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing or communication tasks with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, files, or system calls as data input points.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, subprocess executions, or environment variable manipulations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file operations, with no suspicious intermediate steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flow detected; use of eval/exec noted but deemed controlled and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The static analysis indicates no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or sabotage. The code's structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets. The cautious notes about eval/exec are acknowledged but do not currently suggest malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis, reflecting a low threat level but acknowledging potential concerns about dynamic code execution. Confidence in these conclusions is high (0.9), given the lack of concrete malicious indicators and the simplicity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. Continued monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended to confirm these static findings, but based on current information, the supply chain is considered secure.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
