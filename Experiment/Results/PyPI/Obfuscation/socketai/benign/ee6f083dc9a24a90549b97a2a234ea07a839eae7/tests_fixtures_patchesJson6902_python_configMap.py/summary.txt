  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. Continued monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended to confirm these static findings, but based on current information, the supply chain is considered secure."
