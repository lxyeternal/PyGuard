  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on supply chain security signals.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external modules, data received from user input or environment, network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution points such as eval()/exec().",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input through processing routines to sinks such as network requests, file writes, or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, heavy obfuscation, complex string manipulations, suspicious network activity, obfuscated variable names, untrusted data flow from sources to sinks, potential data exfiltration or malicious code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical data flow from environment or user input to network or file sinks. No hardcoded secrets or malicious commands are detected in benign reports. Suspicious reports show complex string manipulations, network activity, and dynamic code execution, indicating potential malicious intent. Obfuscation levels vary, with some reports showing heavy obfuscation and complex logic, raising suspicion. Scores assigned are consistent with observed behaviors: benign reports have low malware and obfuscation scores, while suspicious ones, especially report 5, have higher scores justified by red flags like eval()/exec(), obfuscation, and untrusted data flow. Confidence levels are high where no malicious activity is detected, and slightly lower in ambiguous cases. Overall, the assessments align with the signals, with the highest concern in report 5, warranting further dynamic analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The provided scores are consistent with the detailed analysis. Benign reports are appropriately scored with zero or low maliciousness and obfuscation. Suspicious reports reflect their complexity and network activity with moderate to high scores. Report 5's high suspicion is justified by multiple red flags. No adjustments are necessary; the overall evaluation accurately reflects the security posture of the dependency.",
