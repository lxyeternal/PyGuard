{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the lack of comments or documentation. It appears to involve importing modules and executing functions, possibly for data processing or utility purposes, but the actual intent cannot be determined definitively.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and potentially from external sources via function calls or environment variables. Specific input sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include function calls that may process or transmit data, possibly involving network communication, file I/O, or sensitive environment variables. No explicit network or file operations are directly visible in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules or environment variables through functions and variables within the code. Without explicit code, specific source-to-sink paths cannot be precisely identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident in the provided snippet. The code structure appears standard; however, the absence of documentation limits certainty.",
  "analysis": "The code contains import statements and possibly function executions. No malicious code patterns, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or system modifications, are observable in this snippet. The overall structure does not show signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Due to limited content, the confidence in detecting malicious behavior is low. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets are detected, but the lack of detailed context prevents a thorough assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no obvious anomalies or malicious patterns identified. However, the limited scope of the provided snippet restricts definitive conclusions.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0,
