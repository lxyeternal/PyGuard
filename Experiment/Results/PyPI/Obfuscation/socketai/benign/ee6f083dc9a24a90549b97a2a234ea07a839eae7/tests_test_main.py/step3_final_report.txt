  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of environment variables, eval/exec, dynamic imports, network modules, and input data.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamic code, network communication, data leakage points, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or untrusted input flow into eval/exec or network modules, potentially leading to malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted data, dynamic imports, obfuscated variable names, suspicious network activity, or code that appears heavily obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits patterns of dynamic code execution and network activity, which are common vectors for malicious behavior. The absence of explicit payloads limits certainty, but the structural suspicion justifies higher risk scores. Benign code lacking suspicious patterns receives low scores. The suspicion in Report 3 regarding eval/exec and network modules warrants a higher malware score and risk assessment. The other reports are consistent with benign or minimal activity.",
  "conclusion": "Overall, the code shows low to moderate suspicion primarily due to dynamic execution and network usage in Report 3. The scores should reflect this, with a malware score of approximately 0.2, obfuscation around 0.3, and a risk score near 0.4. The remaining reports are appropriately scored as low risk and malware. Slight adjustments to confidence and scores enhance accuracy, emphasizing the potential threat in Report 3 without overestimating risk.",
