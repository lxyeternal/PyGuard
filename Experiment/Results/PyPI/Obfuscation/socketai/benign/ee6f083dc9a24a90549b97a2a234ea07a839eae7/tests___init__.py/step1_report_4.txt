  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear from the provided fragment; it appears to be a generic or placeholder snippet without specific functionality.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources or input points identified within the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network communication, file writing, or system modification points are present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable data flows from sources to sinks; the code lacks data processing or transmission logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty or non-existent; no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are observable.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet contains no executable statements, imports, or logic to analyze. Without actual code, there are no potential security issues, malicious behaviors, or suspicious patterns. This makes it impossible to identify sources, sinks, or data flows, and no anomalies are detected due to the absence of code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of any actual code content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be empty or a placeholder with no executable logic. Therefore, it is considered safe in its current form.",
