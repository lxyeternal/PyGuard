  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, obfuscation, and suspicious activities.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external files, network connections, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, system commands, environment variables.",
  "flows": "From sources such as environment variables or inputs to sinks like network or system commands, potentially via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews indicate that most dependencies are benign, with clear structure and no suspicious patterns. Report 3 identifies obfuscation and dynamic eval, justifying higher suspicion scores. Report 5 notes eval usage but lacks evidence of malicious payloads. The scores across reports are consistent with their analyses, with only minor concerns in some cases. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, with a slight elevation due to dynamic code execution in Report 3. No evidence suggests active malware or malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "Most code dependencies are benign, with a low malware score (~0.1) and minimal obfuscation (~0.2). The overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily influenced by suspicious patterns in Report 3. Scores are consistent with observed behaviors; no adjustments are necessary.",
