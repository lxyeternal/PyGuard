  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation extensions, link mappings, regex patterns, and URLs.",
  "sources": "Lists of extensions, dictionaries with URL templates, regex pattern strings, and URL base mappings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; static data used throughout.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration remains unchanged.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'ahLWImPnuwtXFXbwYxWHPPLKerJTqbjF') which are non-descriptive but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static lists, dictionaries, and string assignments used for configuring Sphinx documentation. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or external input handling. Regex patterns and URL templates are standard for documentation purposes. Variable names are obfuscated, which could be suspicious but are likely auto-generated or intentionally obscure. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The obfuscation score in some reports (e.g., 0.6) is justified given the variable names, but this does not imply malicious intent. The malware score remains zero across all assessments, and the security risk is minimal, with slight variations due to obfuscation and URL template usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration script for Sphinx documentation, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, and the overall security assessment should remain low.",
