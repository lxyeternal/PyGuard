{
  "purpose": "The code appears to configure documentation build settings, including extensions and link mappings for Sphinx documentation.",
  "sources": "Data is read from hardcoded string variables, lists, and dictionaries within the code.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or execution functions are present.",
  "flows": "The code mainly processes static configuration data; no untrusted input or data flow to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, such as code execution, obfuscated patterns, or hardcoded credentials, is present. The use of regex patterns and URLs is consistent with standard documentation configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script is a configuration module for Sphinx documentation. It defines extension lists, mappings, and flags using static data. No external data sources or untrusted input handling, no network connections, or code execution is detected. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script for documentation setup with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
