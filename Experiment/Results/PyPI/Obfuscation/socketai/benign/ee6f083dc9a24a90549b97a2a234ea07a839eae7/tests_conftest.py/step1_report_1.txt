  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided; it appears to be a Python module that potentially interacts with external systems or processes.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, user input, and possibly external files or network sources depending on the context within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands execution, network requests, or data storage functions that could lead to data leakage or system modification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs through processing functions and may reach sinks like system commands or network communication functions.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code features include dynamic code execution (e.g., eval or exec), hard-coded secrets, obfuscated or overly complex code, or usage of suspicious external domains. No such anomalies are clearly observed in the provided code snippet, but caution is warranted if such patterns are present elsewhere.",
  "analysis": "The code needs careful step-by-step review: beginning with imports and initializations, checking for dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious external calls. Middle sections should be examined for obfuscated or unnecessary complexity, while the end should be scrutinized for potential system modifications or network activity. Since the actual code content is missing, a definitive analysis cannot be provided, but common indicators of malicious intent such as eval usage, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious external connections should be flagged if present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, no explicit malicious behavior or supply chain threats are identifiable. The absence of suspicious patterns suggests low risk, but the lack of concrete code details limits confidence. The overall security risk appears low.",
