  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a basic utility or functionality, but without specific context or comments, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, function parameters, or possibly external files (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to logs, outputs, or network connections; specific sinks are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables or parameters) to processing functions and possibly to output or external connections.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. Usage of dynamic features appears standard; no unusual patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard Python practices. No malicious behavior, suspicious network activity, or backdoors identified. The code structure is straightforward, with clear data flows and no obfuscation or malicious patterns. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, is typical and does not suggest sabotage. No hardcoded secrets or hidden logic detected. Overall, the code seems benign based on the provided content.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a legitimate purpose without attempting to exfiltrate data, backdoor access, or perform harmful actions. The overall security risk is low.",
