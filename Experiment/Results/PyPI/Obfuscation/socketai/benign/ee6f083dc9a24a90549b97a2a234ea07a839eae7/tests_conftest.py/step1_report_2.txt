  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function based on the provided logic, potentially for a utility or data processing task.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters and possibly from environment variables or external files, depending on specific function implementations.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data may flow into system commands, network requests, or database queries if present, but no explicit sinks are identified as malicious in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through various functions and possibly into output or storage operations, but no suspicious source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs its intended operations without any signs of malicious or maliciously crafted behaviors. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or hidden malicious logic. It uses common Python constructs and libraries without suspicious patterns. No external network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms are visible. The code seems safe based on the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard implementation of its intended functionality.",
