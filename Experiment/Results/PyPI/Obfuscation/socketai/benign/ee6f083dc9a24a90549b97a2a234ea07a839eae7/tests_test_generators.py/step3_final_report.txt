  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code inputs, environment variables, network calls, file operations, dynamic eval/exec, hardcoded credentials/URLs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file system, environment variables, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec or network calls leading to data leaks, system modifications, or remote control actions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation (high), dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, unusual control flow.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation (score 0.7), dynamic eval/exec, and potential hardcoded credentials, indicating malicious intent. The suspicious patterns justify malware score 0.65 and security risk 0.75. No such patterns are present in other reports, which show benign, straightforward code with zero scores. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. The analysis confirms Report 1's suspicion aligns with its scores, while Reports 2-5 lack evidence of malicious activity, justifying zero scores. Overall, the scores are justified and reflect the assessed security posture.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to obfuscation and dynamic code evaluation, warranting caution. Other reports depict benign code with appropriate low scores. The scoring system is consistent with the descriptions, and no adjustments are necessary.",
