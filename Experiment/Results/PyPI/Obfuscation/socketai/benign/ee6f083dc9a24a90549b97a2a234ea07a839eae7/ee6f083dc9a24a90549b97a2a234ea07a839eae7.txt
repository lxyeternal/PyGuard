      "conclusion": "Overall, the code shows low to moderate suspicion primarily due to dynamic execution and network usage in Report 3. The scores should reflect this, with a malware score of approximately 0.2, obfuscation around 0.3, and a risk score near 0.4. The remaining reports are appropriately scored as low risk and malware. Slight adjustments to confidence and scores enhance accuracy, emphasizing the potential threat in Report 3 without overestimating risk."

Suspicious reports reflect their complexity and network activity with moderate to high scores. Report 5's high suspicion is justified by multiple red flags. No adjustments are necessary; the overall evaluation accurately reflects the security posture of the dependency."

The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score of 0 aligns with the analysis. Continued monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended to confirm these static findings, but based on current information, the supply chain is considered secure."
