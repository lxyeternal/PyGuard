  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code analysis for malicious patterns, obfuscation, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Input data reading points, external API calls, environment variable access, network connections, file operations, user input handling.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file writing, system commands execution, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "From data sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via functions or method calls that process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic code execution, hidden backdoors, excessive or unnecessary complexity, misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit malicious patterns, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The absence of code snippets limits definitive conclusions, but based on descriptions, the code appears benign. No suspicious data flows or anomalies are detected. The confidence in benignity is high given the information, and no security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code descriptions and analyses indicate no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the assessments. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
