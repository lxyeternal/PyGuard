  "purpose": "To evaluate supply chain security of the open source Python dependency, identify potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks based on the provided code analysis reports.",
  "sources": "The code itself, including any input/output handling, network connections, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file modifications, or other actions that could lead to security issues if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources (inputs, network, environment variables) to sinks (outputs, storage, network), highlighting any suspicious or anomalous paths.",
  "anomalies": "Any unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or behaviors inconsistent with benign code, such as network connections to suspicious domains or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All five reports consistently indicate the code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The malware scores are 0 across all reports, and obfuscation scores are 0, aligning with the absence of suspicious patterns. The security risk scores are uniformly low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are high (around 0.75 to 0.9), supporting the conclusion of benignity. No inconsistencies or indications of false positives are evident. The reasoning in each report is sound, and the scores are justified based on the described analyses.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analyses. No further action or score adjustments are necessary at this time.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
