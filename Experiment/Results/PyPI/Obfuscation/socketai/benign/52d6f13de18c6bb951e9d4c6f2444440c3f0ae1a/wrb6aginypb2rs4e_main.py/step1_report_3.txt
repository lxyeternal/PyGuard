{
  "purpose": "The code defines several function stubs related to data acquisition and processing, likely for medical or scientific data analysis.",
  "sources": "The functions have parameters such as 'acquisition_id', 'biomarkers', 'annotations', 'channels', 'resolution', 'study_id', 'seg_mask_type', 'segmentation_version', and 'biomarker_version', which suggest input data from external sources or user input.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or data outputs within these functions, as they only contain 'pass' statements. No data is processed or stored within the code snippets provided.",
  "flows": "No active data flow exists because the functions are empty; however, if implemented, 'acquisition_id' and other parameters could serve as sources, with potential for data processing in the future.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are only defined with parameters and no implementation; there are no signs of obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or unusual coding patterns. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of function definitions with descriptive parameter names and no logic or data handling. The naming of functions appears obfuscated but seems to relate to data acquisition and analysis. There is no malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior detectable from these stubs. The lack of implementation means no behavior or side effects are present. Overall, the code appears benign but incomplete.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of placeholder function definitions without implementation, showing no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is likely part of a larger project where actual processing occurs elsewhere. No security concerns are evident based on the provided snippets.",
