{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple function signatures related to data acquisition, processing, and analysis, likely for a medical or research application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as acquisition_id, biomarkers, annotations, channels, resolution, study_id, seg_mask_type, segmentation_version, biomarker_version, config_mode, etc.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; functions are placeholders with no implementation, so no data flows to external systems or sensitive storage within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no actual data flows or function calls with data processing; all functions are empty and only define signatures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be a standard set of function definitions with placeholder bodies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports common data processing libraries pandas and numpy, then declares several functions with descriptive parameter names. All functions have empty bodies with only 'pass' statements, indicating they are placeholders or interfaces. No implementation details, network calls, or suspicious behavior are included. The function names are obscure but do not contain malicious patterns or obfuscated code. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only function signatures with no executable logic. It appears to be a stub or interface definition for a larger system. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
