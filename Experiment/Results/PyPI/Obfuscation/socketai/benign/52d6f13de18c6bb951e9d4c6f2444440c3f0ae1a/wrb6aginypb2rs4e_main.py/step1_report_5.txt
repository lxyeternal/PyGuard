  "purpose": "Define multiple placeholder functions related to acquisition data processing, potentially for a medical or imaging application.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present; all functions are empty (pass statements).",
  "sinks": "No data is being processed, returned, or sent to external systems; no sinks or data flows are observable.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows occur due to lack of implementation; all functions are empty.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code constructs are present; functions are placeholders with no executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of function definitions with no implementation, external calls, or data handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity. The functions are named with seemingly random strings but contain no operational content. This appears to be a scaffold or stub code for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting only of function declarations with no active logic or data processing. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks.",
