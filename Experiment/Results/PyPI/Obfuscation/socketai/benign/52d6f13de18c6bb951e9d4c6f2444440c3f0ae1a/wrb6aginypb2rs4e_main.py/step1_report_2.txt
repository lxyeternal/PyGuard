{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define several placeholder functions for handling acquisition data, likely in a medical or imaging context, but contains no active logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "None of the functions read input or data actively; parameters are either optional or default to None, and function bodies are empty.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or external data transmission present; functions are stubs with no implementation.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs as the functions are empty and do not process or pass data.",
  "anomalies": "All functions are empty, with no logic, data handling, or side effects. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of function definitions with no internal logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no source-to-sink data flows, no security-sensitive operations, and no suspicious code activity. The code appears to be a set of placeholders or interface definitions, possibly for future implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is purely structural with no active operations. The overall security risk is minimal, and there is no indication of any malicious intent or obfuscation.",
