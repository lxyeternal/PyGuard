  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears to be a random string of characters, which is unusual and may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No other code or logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a nonsensical variable name and a version string. There are no imports, functions, or logic that could be malicious. The variable name does not match typical naming conventions and appears intentionally obfuscated or random. No data inputs, sinks, or data flows are present. The code by itself is benign, but the unusual variable name raises suspicion about potential obfuscation or hidden purpose if seen in a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, benign version assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this isolated fragment.",
