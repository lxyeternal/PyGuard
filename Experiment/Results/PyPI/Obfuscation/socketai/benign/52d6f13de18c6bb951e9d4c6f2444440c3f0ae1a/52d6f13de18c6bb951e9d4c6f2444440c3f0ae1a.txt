      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code's primary risk stems from the use of exec() on 'version.py', which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. No direct malicious activity is observed, but the pattern is a supply chain vulnerability. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive. The scores should reflect moderate risk, low malware likelihood, and high caution due to the exec() pattern."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and suspicious network activity, raising moderate concern for malicious behavior. While no definitive malicious payload is identified, the patterns justify a malware score of 0.45, obfuscation score of 0.75, and security risk of 0.6. The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion warranting caution, but not conclusive evidence of malicious intent."

The scores are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, with a high obfuscation score justified by naming. The security risk is minimal, close to zero. Overall, the code poses no security threat in its current form."
