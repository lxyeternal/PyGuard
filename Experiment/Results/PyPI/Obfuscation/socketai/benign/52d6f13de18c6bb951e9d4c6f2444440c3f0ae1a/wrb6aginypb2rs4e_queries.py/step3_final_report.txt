  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with no implementation, serving as interface definitions or scaffolding.",
  "sources": "Function parameters such as acquisition_id, study_id, note_id, story_title, segmentation_version, ROI data, and other identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data flow or data handling occurs; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No execution or data flow; functions are empty with 'pass' statements.",
  "anomalies": "Cryptic, obfuscated parameter names; no implementation or logic; superficial obfuscation but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of empty function definitions with cryptic parameter names, indicating scaffolding or auto-generated stubs. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly due to code generation, but no malicious patterns or behaviors are detectable. The absence of logic and data flow means there are no vulnerabilities, malware, or security risks in the current state. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated around 0.2-0.7, risk=0.1) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as interface placeholders with no active logic or malicious behavior. It poses no security threat in its current form. Future implementation could alter this, but as-is, it is safe.",
