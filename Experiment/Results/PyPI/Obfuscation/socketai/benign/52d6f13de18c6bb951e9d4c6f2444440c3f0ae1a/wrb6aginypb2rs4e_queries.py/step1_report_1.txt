{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define multiple function stubs related to data processing and management, likely in a medical or imaging context, but contains no implementation details.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, primarily acquisition_id, study_id, story_title, segment_version, and ekYnhZujPlhvtukwgXpuEbLStFvvFLkm, which could be used for input or data retrieval.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of return statements returning dataframes, lists, or numpy arrays, which could leak or process sensitive data if implemented maliciously.",
  "flows": "Data could flow from input parameters (sources) into the functions and then into return values or dataframes, but no actual logic is present to establish concrete data flows.",
  "anomalies": "All functions are empty with only pass statements; no code logic, no use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of function declarations with no bodies or implementations. There are no apparent code paths, data handling, or logic that could be malicious. The parameter naming suggests potential handling of sensitive or medical data, but without implementation, there's no evidence of malicious behavior or data leakage. The absence of code execution, network calls, or obfuscation indicates this is likely a scaffold or interface definition rather than operational code.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of function definitions with no operational logic, no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be a placeholder or interface layer. Without implementation details, it poses minimal security threat. However, if actual code is added later, a re-evaluation would be necessary.",
