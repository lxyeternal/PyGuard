  "purpose": "Placeholder functions with obfuscated names, no implementation or logic.",
  "sources": "Function definitions with complex names, no data input or output.",
  "sinks": "None, as functions contain only 'pass' statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution path present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names, no actual code or logic, potential concealment.",
  "analysis": "All functions are empty, serving as placeholders. The obfuscated names suggest possible concealment but no malicious code or data leaks are present. The high obfuscation score reflects naming suspicion, but the absence of logic indicates no active threat. Malware score is set to 0 due to lack of malicious activity. Risk remains low, aligned with placeholder status.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of inert, obfuscated placeholder functions with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The current scores are appropriate; obfuscation warrants monitoring but does not imply malicious intent.",
