  "conclusion": "The code's primary risk stems from the use of exec() on 'version.py', which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. No direct malicious activity is observed, but the pattern is a supply chain vulnerability. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive. The scores should reflect moderate risk, low malware likelihood, and high caution due to the exec() pattern."
