  "sinks": "Potential execution of external code via 'exec' from 'version.py'.",
  "flows": "exec(open('emoaccess/version.py').read()) -> possibly imports code that may execute malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run external file contents; variable names are obfuscated, which could hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks, such as reading a README and setting dependencies. However, the use of 'exec' to run the contents of 'version.py' is suspicious because it can execute arbitrary code, which could include malicious payloads or backdoors. The obfuscated variable names further hide the intent, which is concerning. No other suspicious behaviors like network communication or credential handling are present. Overall, the main concern is the execution of external code via 'exec', which could be exploited to run malicious code during package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical setup tasks but uses 'exec' to execute external code from 'version.py', which introduces a significant security risk. The obfuscated variables and the dynamic execution point to potential malicious intent or at least a security concern. Caution is advised if this code is used or modified.",
