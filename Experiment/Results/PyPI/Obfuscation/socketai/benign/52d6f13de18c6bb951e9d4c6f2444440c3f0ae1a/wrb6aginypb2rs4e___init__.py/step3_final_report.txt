  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code content, data sources, sinks, flows, anomalies, and overall security posture.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, network communication, dynamic code execution, file reads",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, environment variable access, file modifications, potential data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, network requests, dynamic eval/exec, environment variable reads",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious network activity, hardcoded secrets, unusual variable names",
  "analysis": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious network handling, indicating potential malicious intent. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but the obfuscation and network patterns justify suspicion. No hardcoded secrets or malicious commands are explicitly observed. The code's structure suggests possible data exfiltration or control mechanisms, but lacking definitive payloads, suspicion remains moderate.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and suspicious network activity, raising moderate concern for malicious behavior. While no definitive malicious payload is identified, the patterns justify a malware score of 0.45, obfuscation score of 0.75, and security risk of 0.6. The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion warranting caution, but not conclusive evidence of malicious intent.",
