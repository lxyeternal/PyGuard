  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and suspicious network activity, raising moderate concern for malicious behavior. While no definitive malicious payload is identified, the patterns justify a malware score of 0.45, obfuscation score of 0.75, and security risk of 0.6. The overall assessment indicates moderate suspicion warranting caution, but not conclusive evidence of malicious intent."
