  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are observable without code content.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform a detailed step-by-step analysis. The review is limited due to lack of code content; no suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security issues are identifiable from the empty input.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code content, no malicious behavior or security risks can be confirmed. The code appears benign or non-existent from the provided snippet.",
