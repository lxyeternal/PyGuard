{
  "purpose": "Defines API schemas, URL generation, and response utilities for object storage management, including multipart uploads and versioning.",
  "sources": "Request data, URL parameters, Flask request args, app configuration.",
  "sinks": "URL generation via url_for, JSON serialization, response creation, polling with sleep.",
  "flows": "Input data from request/request args → URL generation and response serialization → potential polling loops.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class/variable names, use of sleep loops for polling, 'missing' method, dynamic URL construction from untrusted sources.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles API schema definitions and URL responses with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious payloads, command execution, or network exfiltration. The polling functions could be misused for resource exhaustion but are common in async patterns. Obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious. The dynamic URL generation from untrusted input warrants caution but does not constitute active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign API schema and utility functions with heavy obfuscation. No active malicious activity detected. Obfuscation warrants further review but does not justify high malware or risk scores. Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.75, confidence=0.8.",
