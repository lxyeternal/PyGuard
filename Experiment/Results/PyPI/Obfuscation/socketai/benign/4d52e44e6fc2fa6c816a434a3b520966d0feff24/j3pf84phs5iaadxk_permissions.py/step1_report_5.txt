{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a docstring describing parameters, exceptions, and return types for a function related to handling objects in Invenio Files REST, likely involving permissions and object actions.",
  "sources": "No input sources are explicitly present in the code snippet; it mainly documents parameters and return types.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potentially harmful functions are present in this snippet; it does not execute or process data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are identifiable from the provided snippet; it is purely a descriptive comment block.",
  "anomalies": "The parameter names are obfuscated or nonsensical (e.g., nTlSFlULJLdgdgztqoroQrLcAJqIvXPW, WfltdKkXHngPVvPbpcBMKnABbTqqxSdJ), which is unusual and suggests either obfuscation or a placeholder. No code execution or logic is present to evaluate further.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a docstring with parameters, exceptions, and return types. The parameter names are nonsensical or obfuscated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. There is no executable code, data processing, or external interactions visible. Lack of real code or logic makes security assessment limited. Obfuscation could be benign or malicious, but here it seems to be a formatting or placeholder issue. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident in this descriptive fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is purely a docstring describing function parameters and behavior. The obfuscated parameter names are unusual but do not indicate malicious activity by themselves. No malicious or security-risk code is present; it appears to be a standard documentation block.",
