  "purpose": "Define and export modules and variables related to Invenio Files REST functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.ext and .proxies), and the hardcoded version string.",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data sinks; no external network or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Import modules and set version variable, then export symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly random variable name 'pfWWvuShGZXxKRkyiMxIRxazXqNTLYFR' assigned a version string, which appears obfuscated or intentionally misleading.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two local modules and defines a version string. It also exports certain symbols, including the imported modules and the version string. The variable 'pfWWvuShGZXxKRkyiMxIRxazXqNTLYFR' is unusually named and appears to be obfuscated; it is assigned a version number '3.0.0'. There are no network operations, no credential handling, no dynamic code execution, or other suspicious behaviors. The obfuscated variable name could be an attempt to hide or confuse, but it does not execute or interact with any untrusted data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module declaration with a potentially obfuscated variable name serving no functional purpose other than storing a version string. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
