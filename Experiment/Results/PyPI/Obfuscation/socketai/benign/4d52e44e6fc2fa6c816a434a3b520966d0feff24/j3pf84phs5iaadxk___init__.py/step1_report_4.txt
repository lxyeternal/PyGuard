{
  "purpose": "To define module exports and version information related to file REST functionalities in a package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.ext and .proxies), assignment of version string.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Import modules -> assign version string -> expose symbols via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'pfWWvuShGZXxKRkyiMxIRxazXqNTLYFR' which appears obfuscated or randomly generated, with no clear purpose. The code does not perform any computations or data processing beyond imports and variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific components from local modules, sets a version string with a seemingly random or obfuscated variable name, and defines an __all__ list for module exports. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows involving user or external data, and no suspicious actions such as network activity, cryptographic operations, or data leakage. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated variable name, which might indicate code obfuscation or a placeholder. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward module setup code with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module initialization script with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The only notable aspect is an obfuscated variable name that does not impact functionality.",
