{
  "purpose": "Define and expose the InvenioFilesREST class and current_files_rest proxy for use in other modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.ext and .proxies) and a hardcoded version string.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Imports and the version string are straightforward; no data flow from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly random string 'pfWWvuShGZXxKRkyiMxIRxazXqNTLYFR' assigned to a variable. The variable name appears nonsensical, which could be an obfuscation attempt or an artifact. No other suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes and proxies from local modules, which is typical in package setup. The string 'pfWWvuShGZXxKRkyiMxIRxazXqNTLYFR' assigned to a variable with a non-descriptive name is unusual and may be an obfuscated or placeholder value, but it does not perform any operation or call external systems. The __all__ variable correctly exposes intended public symbols. Overall, the code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily defines module exports and includes an inexplicable variable assignment. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security risks. The random string may warrant further context, but on its own, it is not harmful.",
