  "purpose": "Module setup importing local modules, defining a version string, and exporting symbols.",
  "sources": "Imports from .ext and .proxies modules, assignment of version string to obfuscated variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data input handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a highly obfuscated variable name 'pfWWvuShGZXxKRkyiMxIRxazXqNTLYFR' assigned to a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports and exports with no network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated variable name, which appears to serve as a container for a version string and does not influence program behavior. Multiple expert reviews confirm the absence of malicious logic, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscated variable is likely an artifact or placeholder, not malicious. Malware scores are correctly set to zero; risk scores are very low (~0.1), and obfuscation scores are moderate (~0.2-0.3), reflecting superficial obfuscation without security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing standard module setup with an obfuscated variable name that does not pose security risks. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
