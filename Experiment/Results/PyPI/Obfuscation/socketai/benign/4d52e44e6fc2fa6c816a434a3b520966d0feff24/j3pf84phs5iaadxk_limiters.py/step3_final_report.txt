  "purpose": "Utility for managing file size limits and quota enforcement through comparison operators on limit objects.",
  "sources": "Object attributes such as 'oadrYcpGnrDzNjVRhFaAsfoyCnGDeXAX' and 'ZKbzBFmmrHpjauHeWeKkVHtDVmKjZuVo' from input parameter 'duTMUFGSvopnjMnKiLrkdvQiHcrwuFoD'.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data flows internally through attribute access and comparison operations.",
  "flows": "Input object attributes are read to instantiate limit objects; comparison operators (__lt__, __gt__, __eq__) compare these limit values internally.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; presence of NotImplementedError as a class attribute indicating incomplete or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for size limit comparison with overloaded operators, and a function that extracts specific attributes from an input object to create instances of this class. The obfuscation suggests concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The NotImplementedError attribute is unusual but not harmful; it may cause runtime errors if comparison is attempted without proper implementation. No external system interactions, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The logic is straightforward, serving as a utility for size or quota checks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for size and quota validation, obfuscated but without any malicious payloads or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score reflects concealment, but no evidence of sabotage, backdoors, or data exfiltration exists. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation and incomplete code hints.",
