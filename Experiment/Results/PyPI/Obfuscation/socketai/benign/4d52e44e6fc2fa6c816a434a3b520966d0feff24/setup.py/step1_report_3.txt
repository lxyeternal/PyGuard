{
  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit sources of input or data; only the import and call to setup() with default parameters.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code merely invokes setup() with default configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls its 'setup()' function with default parameters. This is a common and standard pattern in Python package setup scripts. There are no inputs, no data flows, and no suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears to serve only the purpose of packaging the module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard packaging code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code.",
