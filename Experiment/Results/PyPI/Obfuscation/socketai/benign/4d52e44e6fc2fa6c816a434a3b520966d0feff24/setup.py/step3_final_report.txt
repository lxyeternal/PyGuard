{
  "purpose": "This code is a minimal setup script for Python packaging, importing 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calling it with default parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, data, or untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code simply executes a function call with no data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns, are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard boilerplate for Python package setup. It contains no malicious behavior, no external data handling, and no suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious features justify these scores. There are no anomalies or signs of malicious intent. The confidence in this assessment is high (1.0).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the code's content and behavior.",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "obfuscated": 0.0,
