{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and configure a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it solely imports and calls a setup function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code executes a static setup call.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module and calls its 'setup()' function with default parameters. This is typical for Python package setup scripts. No user input, network operations, or dynamic code execution is present. The script appears to be a standard package setup without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
