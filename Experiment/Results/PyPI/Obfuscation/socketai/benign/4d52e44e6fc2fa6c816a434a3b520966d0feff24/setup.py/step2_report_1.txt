  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content and Behavior:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, standard setup script importing `setup` from `setuptools` and calling it with default parameters.\n   - There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or external data handling involved.\n   - No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present.\n   - The code is typical boilerplate used in Python packaging.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious or Suspicious Elements:**\n   - None of the reports find any signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.\n   - The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or contain obfuscated parts.\n   - The `setup()` function is called with default parameters, which is standard practice.\n\n3. **Score Justification:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `malware`: 0.0\n     - `obfuscated`: 0.0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0.0\n   - These scores are consistent with the code analysis.\n\n4. **Assessment of Scores:**\n   - Given the straightforward nature of the code and the unanimous agreement among reports, the scores seem appropriate.\n   - The confidence level is 1.0, indicating certainty in the benign nature of this code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary based on the evidence.\n\n**Final Judgment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — No malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.0 — Code is clear, straightforward, and standard.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.0 — No security risks identified.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and thorough.\n- The code is benign boilerplate for Python packaging.\n- No further action or suspicion is warranted.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code is a typical, harmless setup script with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned are appropriate and justified.",
