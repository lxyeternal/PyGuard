  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted inputs; the setup() function executes without external input processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard usage of setuptools. No suspicious or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the setuptools module and calls it with default parameters. This is a common pattern for Python package setup scripts. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or malicious behaviors are observed. The script is simple and standard for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic, standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is typical boilerplate code used in Python package distribution.",
