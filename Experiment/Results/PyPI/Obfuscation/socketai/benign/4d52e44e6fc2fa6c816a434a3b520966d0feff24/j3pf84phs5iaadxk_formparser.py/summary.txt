  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard, albeit obfuscated, form parser extension with no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious behavior. Scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscation score approximately 0.75, low security risk (~0.2). Continuous monitoring and de-obfuscation are recommended for security assurance."
