{
  "purpose": "The code manages file instances, including batch processing, multipart uploads, cleanup of expired files, and progress updates, primarily for a file storage backend.",
  "sources": "UUIDs, environment configurations, database queries, and function parameters for file operations.",
  "sinks": "Database updates, file copying and merging, scheduled cleanup tasks, and asynchronous task dispatching.",
  "flows": "Input data (UUIDs, parameters) → database fetches and updates → file operations (copy, merge) → task scheduling and cleanup.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, complex control flow, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, standard library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical backend file management functions such as copying, merging, and cleanup, with obfuscated identifiers that obscure intent but do not demonstrate malicious behavior. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt at concealment but is not necessarily malicious. The logic aligns with legitimate operational patterns, and no malicious payloads or suspicious network calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate file management component with significant obfuscation that warrants cautious review. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate, though ongoing monitoring is recommended due to obfuscation.",
