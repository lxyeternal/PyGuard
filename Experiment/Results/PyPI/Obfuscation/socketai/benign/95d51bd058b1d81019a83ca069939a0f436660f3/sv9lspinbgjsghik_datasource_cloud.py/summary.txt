  "conclusion": "The code is a standard database access layer with obfuscation and debug statements. No malicious activity or sabotage detected. The main risks are data leakage via logs and obfuscation used to conceal purpose, but these are not inherently malicious. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.6), and overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
