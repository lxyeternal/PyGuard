  "purpose": "Utility functions for data type conversion and sanitization of MAC addresses.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'serialized_num' and 'mac_address' in respective functions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to external systems or data exfiltration; functions are purely local utilities.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed locally; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names, which can be a tactic to hide malicious intent but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two utility functions: one attempts to convert input to int or float, returning the original string if conversions fail; the other removes specific delimiters from MAC address strings using regex. Names are heavily obfuscated, which can be suspicious but does not imply malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward, with no network activity, credential handling, or system modifications. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are present. The obfuscation warrants caution but is common in both legitimate and malicious code. The functions are benign, standard data processing routines. The malware score is 0, consistent with the benign nature. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), reflecting the naming style, but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk score is low (~0.2), as the functions perform simple, safe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module performing data normalization and sanitization with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
