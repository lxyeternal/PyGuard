  "purpose": "Utility functions for data type conversion and string sanitization",
  "sources": "Function parameters: 'serialized_num' and 'mac_address'",
  "sinks": "Return statements and re.sub operation on 'mac_address'",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> type conversion or string sanitization -> return results",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. Functions perform simple data conversions and regex replacements.",
  "analysis": "The first function attempts to convert input to int or float, falling back to returning the original input. The second function removes colons, underscores, and hyphens from a MAC address string. Both functions perform standard data processing tasks with no evidence of malicious behavior, malicious data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing basic data conversion and string sanitization without any malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
