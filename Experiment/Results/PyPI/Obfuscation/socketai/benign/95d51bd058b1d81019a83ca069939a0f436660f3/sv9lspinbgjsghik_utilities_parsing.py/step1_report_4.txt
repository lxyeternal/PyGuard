{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for data type conversion and string sanitization, possibly for processing user input or data normalization.",
  "sources": "The functions take input parameters 'serialized_num' and 'mac_address'. These could originate from external sources such as user input, files, or network data.",
  "sinks": "The functions do not have external data sinks or actions that send data outside the system; they only perform conversions and string replacements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('serialized_num' or 'mac_address') through conversion or regex substitution functions, with no external output or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behaviors are present. The regex is simple and used for string sanitization. No suspicious or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The first function attempts to convert input to int, then float, else returns original input. This is a common normalization step with no malicious intent. The second function removes colons, underscores, and hyphens from a MAC address string, which is a typical sanitization step. No obfuscated code, no data exfiltration, or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to normal utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for data processing. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The functions are simple and serve common purposes without suspicious behavior.",
