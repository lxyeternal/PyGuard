{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be utility functions for data processing, specifically converting serialized numbers and cleaning up MAC address formats.",
  "sources": "The function gBPCHMVRanIpKlvjMbqTcqQfRYttFjeb reads input data as a MAC address string. The function CxCclgAfEsQuFUIpDQrZvvJIniZZqLJw reads serialized numeric data.",
  "sinks": "The code does not have explicit sinks; it processes and returns data without external system calls, network operations, or data storage.",
  "flows": "Input string from MAC address is sanitized by removing colons, underscores, and hyphens. The serialized number input is converted into int or float if possible, or returned as-is.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors. The code uses regex for string manipulation, which is typical. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The first function attempts to convert input to int or float, which is common in data parsing routines. The second function removes specific delimiters from MAC address strings, which is standard for normalization. There are no signs of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or obfuscated logic. The use of try-except blocks is standard practice. Overall, the code appears to be utility functions with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing straightforward data conversion and string manipulation. There are no indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
