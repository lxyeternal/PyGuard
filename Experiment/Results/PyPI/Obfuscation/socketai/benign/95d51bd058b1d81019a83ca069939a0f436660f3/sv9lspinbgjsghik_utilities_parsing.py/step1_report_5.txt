{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be utility functions: one for converting a string to a number if possible, and another for sanitizing or normalizing a MAC address string by removing certain delimiters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'serialized_num' and 'mac_address' received by functions CxCclgAfEsQuFUIpDQrZvvJIniZZqLJw and gBPCHMVRanIpKlvjMbqTcqQfRYttFjeb respectively.",
  "sinks": "The functions return processed data; no external data sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into processing functions, with potential transformations (parsing to int/float or regex substitution). No further data transmission or malicious payload delivery observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation are present. The regex pattern is straightforward and used for simple string replacement.",
  "analysis": "The first function attempts to parse a serialized number into int or float, reverting to the original string if parsing fails. The second function removes colons, underscores, and hyphens from a MAC address string. Both functions perform standard data normalization without executing external code, system calls, or network activity. There are no signs of malicious intent, code injection, or covert data exfiltration. The code is simple, clear, and follows common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign data parsing and string manipulation without any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not exhibit obfuscation, backdoors, or malware-like features. Overall, it appears safe and non-malicious.",
