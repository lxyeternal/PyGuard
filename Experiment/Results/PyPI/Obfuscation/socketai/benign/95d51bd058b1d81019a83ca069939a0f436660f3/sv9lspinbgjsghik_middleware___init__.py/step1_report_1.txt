  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions, with no immediately obvious malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables and potentially user-provided data via function parameters or external inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands if used, but no such actions are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, but there are no indications of untrusted data being directed to sensitive operations or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code does not use obfuscation techniques or uncommon language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard function definitions, imports, and control structures. There are no signs of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, remote access, or system damage. The code does not contain dynamic execution, suspicious network calls, or credential theft mechanisms. Given the absence of unusual patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators, the code seems benign. The overall structure suggests it is part of a larger, normal utility or application.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be legitimate with no hidden malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high, and no obfuscation or malware signals are detected.",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "obfuscated": 0,
