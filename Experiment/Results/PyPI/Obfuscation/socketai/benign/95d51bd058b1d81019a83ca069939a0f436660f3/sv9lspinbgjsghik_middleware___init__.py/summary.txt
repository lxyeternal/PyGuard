  "conclusion": "The code's suspicious patterns justify a malware score of approximately 0.6 and an obfuscation score of around 0.7 if such patterns are confirmed. Benign code aligns with scores of 0 in malware and obfuscation. Scores are consistent with the observed behaviors, with Report 3 warranting further code review to confirm suspicion. Overall, the supply chain appears low risk unless concrete malicious indicators are verified."
