  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potentially suspicious functions (e.g., eval, exec), hardcoded secrets, network calls, obfuscated code segments.",
  "sinks": "External network communication, file system modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (hardcoded strings, environment variables) to sinks (network, file writes, eval/exec functions).",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs or credentials, suspicious network activity, unusual code complexity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and uses functions like eval or exec, which are common indicators of malicious intent. Hardcoded secrets or URLs suggest potential exfiltration or backdoor setup. Network activity or suspicious data flows reinforce malicious suspicion. Lack of such patterns indicates benign behavior. The scores assigned reflect these observations, with higher malware and obfuscation scores justified if such patterns are confirmed. The overall security risk correlates with these indicators, with benign code scoring low and suspicious code scoring higher.",
  "conclusion": "The code's suspicious patterns justify a malware score of approximately 0.6 and an obfuscation score of around 0.7 if such patterns are confirmed. Benign code aligns with scores of 0 in malware and obfuscation. Scores are consistent with the observed behaviors, with Report 3 warranting further code review to confirm suspicion. Overall, the supply chain appears low risk unless concrete malicious indicators are verified.",
