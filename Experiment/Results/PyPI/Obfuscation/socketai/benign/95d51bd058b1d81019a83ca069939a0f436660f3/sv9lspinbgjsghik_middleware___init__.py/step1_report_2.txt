{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility functions within a larger Python project. Without specific context, it is likely intended for general package functionality.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data being sent over the network, written to files, or used in system commands. Any usage of eval, exec, or insecure data handling routines would be critical here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input/env/file/network) to sinks (network transmission, file writes, system calls). Malicious flows could involve untrusted data reaching critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. Unusual language features are not detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. The structure suggests typical utility code without hidden behaviors. No external network connections, no dynamic code execution, and no data exfiltration mechanisms are evident. Without additional context or hidden code, the risk appears minimal.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The code is standard and does not contain any malicious payloads or vulnerabilities. Confidence is high that this code is benign.",
