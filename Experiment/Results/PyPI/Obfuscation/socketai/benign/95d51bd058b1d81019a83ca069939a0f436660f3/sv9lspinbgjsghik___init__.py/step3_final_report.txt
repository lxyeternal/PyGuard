  "purpose": "Initialize package with version string and import core modules.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only static variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; static code with imports and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'MkOIcImQMgyhJaWmKyshWbOpTulUbBmL' is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, serving as a package initializer. It assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable and imports modules. No dynamic code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly assign malware score 0, reflecting no malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores vary but are justified given the variable name complexity. Security risk scores are low, consistent with benign code. Overall, the code appears safe, with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard package setup with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
