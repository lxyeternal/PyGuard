{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, reading README and HISTORY files for long descriptions and specifying dependencies and package data.",
  "sources": "File reading operations for README.rst and HISTORY.rst; data assigned to variables; setup() function parameters",
  "sinks": "The setup() function that processes package metadata and dependencies",
  "flows": "Reading files (sources) to variables, then passing those variables into setup() parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., FHRioxEwVSUuRJSoauGhoCEocIuTLNDw), no actual malicious code, and no dynamic execution or obfuscated patterns. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup process, reading static files and defining package metadata and dependencies. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not affect functionality or security. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The setup process is straightforward, and dependencies listed are typical for Python packages.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign package setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to obscure code readability but not malicious intent. No signs of malware or security risks are present.",
