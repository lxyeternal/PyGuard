  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst and HISTORY.rst files for long description, defines dependencies list.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or user input; setup parameters are static.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows from sources to sinks; static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear obfuscated or auto-generated, but no malicious actions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup functions, reads static files for package descriptions, and defines dependencies. Variables have obfuscated names but are used in the setup configuration. No use of eval, exec, network operations, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious behavior, or data exfiltration patterns are present. The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. No malicious code, malware, or security risks are identified. The obfuscation appears to be simply variable naming, not malicious concealment.",
