  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads static files and defines package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README.rst and HISTORY.rst files, defining dependency lists and package configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or code execution points; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Read static files into variables, pass dependency lists and metadata into setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not influence functionality; no malicious code, dynamic execution, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which appear to be a redaction or naming strategy rather than malicious. No dynamic code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The dependencies are common packages, and the setup process is straightforward. The obfuscation does not introduce vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious intent is evident. The obfuscated score is high (~0.8) due to variable naming, which is justified but not malicious. The security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent.",
