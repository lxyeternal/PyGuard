  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local and cloud modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements retrieving classes/functions from .local and .cloud modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "Imported names are assigned to local identifiers but not used further in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear as randomly generated strings, possibly obfuscated or placeholders. No other code operations are present, which suggests potential obfuscation or incomplete code. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific identifiers from internal modules. The imported names are non-descriptive and appear as random strings, which could indicate obfuscation, placeholder, or malicious hiding. There are no data inputs, outputs, or processing shown. The code is minimal, lacking any operations, function calls, or network activity. Without further context, the code alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior but raises suspicion due to the nonsensical naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code only consists of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which may be a sign of obfuscation or incomplete code. No malicious actions or security risks are evident based solely on these import statements. However, the suspicious naming warrants further review of the related modules.",
