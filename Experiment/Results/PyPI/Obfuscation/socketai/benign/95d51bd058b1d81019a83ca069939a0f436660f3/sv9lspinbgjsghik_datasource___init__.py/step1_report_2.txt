  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local and cloud modules, likely for internal use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements accessing local and cloud modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external communications in this snippet",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements, no data flow, input, or output code",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are long, seemingly random strings; no visible suspicious behavior, but unusual naming could indicate obfuscation or autogenerated code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules. The imported names are large, nonsensical identifiers, which might suggest obfuscation or autogenerated code. No data handling, network operations, or suspicious constructs are present. Since no functions or executable code are included, no malicious actions or security risks are evident. The code appears benign in isolation, but the unconventional naming warrants caution if associated with other suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code only performs imports of seemingly obfuscated class or function names from local and cloud modules, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The unusual naming conventions could be a red flag for obfuscation but do not necessarily indicate malicious intent.",
