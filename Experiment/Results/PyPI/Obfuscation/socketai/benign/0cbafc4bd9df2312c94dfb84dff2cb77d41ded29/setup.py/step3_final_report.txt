{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python package setup script that reads 'README.md' and configures package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file into a variable; static string literals for package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content into a variable, then passes it to setuptools.setup() without further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names, which are unusual but not malicious; no suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. It performs no dynamic or network operations, no handling of untrusted input beyond reading a static file, and no hardcoded credentials or malicious payloads. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not impact security or functionality. All signals point to a benign, typical package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe and performs its intended purpose without malicious intent. Obfuscated variable names are superficial and do not indicate malicious behavior. No security risks or malware are present.",
