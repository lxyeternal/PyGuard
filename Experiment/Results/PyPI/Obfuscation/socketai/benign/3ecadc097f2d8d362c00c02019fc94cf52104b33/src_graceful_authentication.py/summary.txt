  "conclusion": "The code functions as legitimate authentication middleware with obfuscation that may be intended to hinder analysis but does not exhibit malicious behavior. No evidence of supply chain sabotage or malware is detected. The obfuscation level is moderate, but the logic aligns with standard security middleware. Overall, the code poses a low security risk."
