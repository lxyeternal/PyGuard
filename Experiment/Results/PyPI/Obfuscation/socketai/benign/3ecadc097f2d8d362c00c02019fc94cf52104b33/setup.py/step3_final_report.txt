  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from '__init__.py' via file open and eval(), reads README.md for description.",
  "sinks": "Uses eval() on content from '__init__.py' to determine version.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> eval() executes code to extract version info.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval() on external file content, no input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. The primary security concern is the use of eval() on the content of '__init__.py' to determine the version, which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. No network activity, data leaks, or system modifications are present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment but does not directly indicate malicious intent. The use of eval() is risky; replacing it with ast.literal_eval() or safer parsing methods would mitigate potential code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The script shows no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The main risk stems from the unsafe eval() call, which could be exploited if the source file is maliciously altered. Obfuscation adds suspicion but is not definitive of malicious intent. Overall, the code is moderately risky due to eval(), but not malicious.",
