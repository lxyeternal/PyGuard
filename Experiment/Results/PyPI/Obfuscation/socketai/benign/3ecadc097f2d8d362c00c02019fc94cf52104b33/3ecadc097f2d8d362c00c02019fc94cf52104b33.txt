      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The script shows no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The main risk stems from the unsafe eval() call, which could be exploited if the source file is maliciously altered. Obfuscation adds suspicion but is not definitive of malicious intent. Overall, the code is moderately risky due to eval(), but not malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as legitimate authentication middleware with obfuscation that may be intended to hinder analysis but does not exhibit malicious behavior. No evidence of supply chain sabotage or malware is detected. The obfuscation level is moderate, but the logic aligns with standard security middleware. Overall, the code poses a low security risk."

The scores are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscation slightly elevated (~0.2), and minimal security risk (~0.1). Further investigation is recommended if such strings appear in executable code, but based on current content, the code is safe."
