  "purpose": "Validation functions for resource attributes, including threshold checks and regex matching.",
  "sources": "Function arguments such as min_value, max_value, and match parameter; no external data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Regex compilation and matching; potential if untrusted input is used without sanitization.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into validation checks and regex operations; no external or network data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., ytrhOWWsDwxikkOsRzaNjBayjCGgXvlh), repeated descriptions, inconsistent formatting, and placeholder-like comments suggest obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be primarily documentation or template code with obfuscated variable names, lacking executable logic. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. Regex usage could pose risks if inputs are untrusted, but no concrete evidence is present. The obfuscation seems superficial, possibly for concealment or poor naming practices. Scores assigned in reports (malware 0, low security risk) are consistent with the benign nature of the snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign validation logic with obfuscated identifiers, posing minimal security risks. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate; caution is advised if further code reveals actual executable logic or external interactions.",
