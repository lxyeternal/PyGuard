  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package distribution, including reading version info and README, and defining entry points for command-line scripts.",
  "sources": "Reading version string from __init__.py, reading README.rst, os.path.join, sys.version_info, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable to dynamic code execution if inputs are untrusted, but none detected; uses standard setup procedures.",
  "flows": "Read version -> parse version -> assemble package metadata -> define entry points based on Python version -> invoke setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, inconsistent indentation, use of sys.version_info for environment detection, complex string formatting, and dynamic entry point creation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious strings found.",
  "analysis": "The code performs package setup: reading version info from __init__.py with regex, reading README.rst, and constructing a dictionary of setup parameters. It uses obfuscated variable names but only for standard setup logic. No malicious code, network access, or hidden behaviors are present. The use of dynamic entry points depending on Python version is standard practice. No signs of code injection, data leaks, or malicious backdoors are detected. The code structure appears typical for a setup script with some obfuscation in variable naming but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The logic is straightforward and aligns with common packaging practices.",
