{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package for distribution, defining package metadata, reading version info, and configuring entry points for console scripts.",
  "sources": "Reading version info from a file, reading README file, obtaining environment info via sys and os modules.",
  "sinks": "None of the identified code writes untrusted input or data to external systems or files. No dangerous sinks are present.",
  "flows": "The code reads version info and README content, then uses these to configure package setup parameters, including entry points based on Python version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, inconsistent code formatting, and an unusual approach to constructing paths and package info. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs package setup tasks: reading version information from a source file, reading README content, and configuring package metadata. The obfuscated variable names suggest code concealment but are consistent with standard setup practices. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. No evidence of malicious data leaks, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code dynamically sets entry points based on Python version, which is a normal compatibility practice. Overall, the code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The script does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious payloads.",
