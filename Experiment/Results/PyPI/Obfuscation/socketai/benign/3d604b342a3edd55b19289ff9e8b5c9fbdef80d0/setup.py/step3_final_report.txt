  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, reading version info from __init__.py, and configuring entry points based on Python version.",
  "sources": "Reads version info from __init__.py via regex, reads README.rst, and environment variables for Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks; no network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "flows": "Reads version and README files, constructs setup parameters, conditionally sets entry points, and calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic path construction, and conditional entry point definitions based on Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with obfuscation mainly in variable naming and dynamic path construction. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present. The regex parsing for version info assumes a standard pattern. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's logic is straightforward and aligns with common setup scripts. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation is moderate and likely intended to hinder readability but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with obfuscation that does not suggest malicious intent. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious, and the overall security posture is low risk.",
