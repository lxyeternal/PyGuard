  "purpose": "Compatibility layer and obfuscation with dynamic code execution capabilities.",
  "sources": "Python version info, imported modules based on version, the `exec()` string defining a function that raises exceptions.",
  "sinks": "None directly evident; potential for misuse if the `exec()` string is manipulated or extended.",
  "flows": "Version info check -> conditional imports -> variable redefinitions -> `exec()` defining exception-raising function.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation, self-referential variable assignments, version-dependent code, dynamic `exec()` with a function that raises exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs environment detection and compatibility setup, heavily obfuscated to hide intent. The `exec()` call defines a function that raises exceptions within a try-finally block, which could be exploited maliciously if the string is altered. No active malicious activity such as network or file operations is present. The obfuscation and dynamic code execution patterns are suspicious but not conclusively malicious. The variable names and structure suggest an intent to conceal, but no direct harm is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an obfuscated compatibility and setup script with potential for malicious use via dynamic code execution. No active malicious activity is observed, but the obfuscation and `exec()` pattern warrant caution. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a malware score around 0.2, obfuscation near 0.8, and moderate risk (~0.4) reflect the current assessment.",
