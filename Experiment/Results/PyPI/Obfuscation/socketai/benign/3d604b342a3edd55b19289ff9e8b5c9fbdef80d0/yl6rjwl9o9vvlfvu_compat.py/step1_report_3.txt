{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform environment detection and conditional imports, possibly for compatibility purposes, but it also includes obfuscated dynamic code execution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Python version information from sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the exec() call with a string containing a function definition, which could be used to execute arbitrary code.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → conditional import and variable reassignments → exec() with obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "The code reassigns standard functions like range to xrange in Python 2, and has obfuscated variable names. The exec() call contains a string that defines a function with a try-finally block, which could be used maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The script checks the Python version to determine if it is Python 2 or 3, then conditionally imports modules for compatibility. It reassigns some variables with obfuscated names. Notably, it contains an exec() call executing a string that defines a function 'wgFNVVZuNAOmyGXVlUGThCCWANjclFcw'. This function raises an exception with a traceback, which could be used for malicious purposes such as executing arbitrary code or obfuscation. The use of exec() with a string, especially with obfuscated code, is suspicious and a common indicator of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated and uses exec() to execute dynamically generated code, which could be malicious. Its purpose is not entirely clear, but the obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest potential malicious intent or an attempt to hide malicious functionality.",
