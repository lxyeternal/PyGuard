  "conclusion": "The code is primarily an obfuscated compatibility and setup script with potential for malicious use via dynamic code execution. No active malicious activity is observed, but the obfuscation and `exec()` pattern warrant caution. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; a malware score around 0.2, obfuscation near 0.8, and moderate risk (~0.4) reflect the current assessment."
