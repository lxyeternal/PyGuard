{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to control test execution flow based on environment variables, primarily for skipping tests under certain conditions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables such as 'PYT_TEST_CLASS_COUNT', 'PYT_TEST_COUNT', and 'PYT_TEST_MODULE_COUNT' accessed via os.environ.get().",
  "sinks": "Functions raise 'SkipTest' exceptions to skip tests, acting as control points based on environment data.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read in functions, influencing whether 'SkipTest' is raised, thus controlling test execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; no malicious code or external network activity detected; logic is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables to determine test counts and conditions, raising 'SkipTest' exceptions accordingly. Obfuscated names suggest an attempt at concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. No external data leaks, network activity, or harmful system modifications are present. The functions serve as test control utilities with standard control flow based on environment variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test utility module that uses environment variables to control test skipping. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and low risk.",
