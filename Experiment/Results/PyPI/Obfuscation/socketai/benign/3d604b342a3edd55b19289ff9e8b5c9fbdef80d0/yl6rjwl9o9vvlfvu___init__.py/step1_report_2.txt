{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a set of utility functions for conditional test skipping based on environment variables, likely used in a testing framework.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (PYT_TEST_CLASS_COUNT, PYT_TEST_COUNT, PYT_TEST_MODULE_COUNT) accessed via os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; functions raise SkipTest exceptions based on environment-driven logic, primarily affecting test execution flow.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Conditions -> Skipping tests",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for controlling test flow is typical; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables related to test counts and modules, then uses these to determine whether to skip certain tests. The logic is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code present. No network or data exfiltration code is present. The functions simply conditionally skip tests based on environment state, which is a common testing practice. No malicious or maliciously disguised behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for controlling test execution based on environment variables. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The structure and content are typical of test helper modules.",
