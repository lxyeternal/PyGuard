  "purpose": "No functional code present; script appears to be a placeholder with only environment and encoding declarations.",
  "sources": "No input or data sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths due to absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable statements or logic; only shebang and encoding comment present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains only a shebang line and an encoding declaration, with no actual code, logic, or data handling. There are no sources, sinks, or flows, nor any signs of obfuscated or malicious code. The script appears to be a stub or placeholder, not an executable program. No malicious behavior or security risks are detectable based on this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is essentially empty and does not perform any actions or contain any malicious elements. It is a template or placeholder rather than functional code. No security concerns are present.",
