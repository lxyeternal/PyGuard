  "purpose": "Placeholder or minimal script containing only shebang and encoding declaration.",
  "sources": "Shebang line and encoding declaration",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, functions, variables, or data handling; only headers present",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a shebang and encoding declaration with no executable logic, data sources, or sinks. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The minimal content indicates a placeholder or template, not an active script. All reports correctly identify the benign nature and assign scores of zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with confidence levels reflecting certainty based on the minimal content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated content. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's minimal, header-only structure.",
