{
  "purpose": "The code consists solely of comments and docstrings describing parameters and return values for utility functions, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "The comments and docstrings themselves serve as the data source; no external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or security effects, as no code processes data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, since the code contains only documentation.",
  "anomalies": "Formatting irregularities and placeholder text are present but are superficial and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are purely descriptive comments and docstrings with no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. The anomalies are formatting issues or placeholder artifacts, not malicious patterns. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting the benign and documentation-only nature of the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign documentation fragments with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The current scores are accurate and do not require adjustment.",
