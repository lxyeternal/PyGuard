  "purpose": "Commented section describing parameters and return values for a function, likely related to testing utilities.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; comments describe expected parameters.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling, no external output, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "No actual executable code or data flow; only docstring comments present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a docstring with inconsistent indentation and formatting, but no malicious or suspicious code.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet consists solely of a comment block that documents function parameters and return values. It does not contain executable code, data processing, or any logic that could be malicious. There are no indications of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The comments do not reveal any hardcoded secrets or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a standard docstring possibly extracted from a larger codebase. No code execution or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a non-executable docstring describing a function's interface. It does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. Based on the available content, it appears safe.",
