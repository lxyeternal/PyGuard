  "purpose": "Module setup defining exports, version, and importing internal components with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules with obfuscated variable names, version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no external inputs or network activity.",
  "flows": "Imports and exports without dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and module names; no clear explanation for obfuscation, but no malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module setup with an __all__ list, version string, and imports from local modules. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. Obfuscated names could be auto-generated or stylistic, not necessarily malicious. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation raises mild suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero, the obfuscation score is moderate to high (~0.7), and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The overall assessment indicates a benign module with obfuscation but no malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated module setup with no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the static analysis suggests minimal risk. Continue monitoring for runtime behaviors if part of a larger codebase, but based on this fragment, the supply chain risk is low.",
