{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define public exports for a module, likely part of an authentication system, and imports several components from submodules.",
  "sources": "The code reads its own module's namespace (exports), a version string, and imported modules and functions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; imports and exports are standard module operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly declares exports and imports modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated variable names (e.g., QkJvuDeOTNuXkXVAzcrmbAapxRlTIETU, mvoBAhsqnInZFFQNQdBIQsxJUYNgUZxv) suggests obfuscation or concealment. No explicit malicious code such as network activity, file modification, or backdoors is present. The code structure is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The module exports a set of identifiers related to authentication and configuration, which are standard for such systems. The import statements import various components with obfuscated names, but these do not by themselves indicate malicious intent. The version string appears normal. No external data sources, network calls, or sensitive data handling are visible. The obfuscated variable names could be suspicious, but without further code, they may just be an attempt at code concealment or auto-generated naming. Overall, the code appears to be a standard module setup with obfuscated import names, no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module interface with obfuscated internal variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this fragment. The obfuscation could be benign or an attempt to conceal internal logic, but there is no clear malicious activity.",
