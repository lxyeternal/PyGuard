  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SMTP server implementation with SSL support, obfuscated possibly for concealment. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The low malware score (0.1) and moderate security risk (0.3) are appropriate, considering the obfuscation and external certificate handling but lack of active malicious indicators."
