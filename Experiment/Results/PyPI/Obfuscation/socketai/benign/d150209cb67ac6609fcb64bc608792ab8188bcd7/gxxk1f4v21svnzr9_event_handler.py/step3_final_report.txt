  "purpose": "Manages a set of callback functions allowing addition, removal, and invocation via operator overloading.",
  "sources": "External functions added as handlers via __iadd__, __isub__, and invoked in __call__.",
  "sinks": "Invocation of handlers with arbitrary arguments; no external data sources or untrusted inputs directly within this code.",
  "flows": "Handlers added to the set are called with provided arguments during __call__, no external data flows evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard event handler pattern with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, external data leaks, or suspicious activities are present. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The main risk depends on what handlers are added externally, which is outside the scope of this code. Malware score is 0, as no malicious code is present. Obfuscation score is high (~0.8) due to variable naming. Security risk is low (~0.2), reflecting potential if malicious handlers are added. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign callback handler utility with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious activity or malware. The security risk is minimal but should be noted if untrusted handlers are added. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
