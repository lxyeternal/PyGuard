{
  "purpose": "The code implements a flexible event handler system that allows adding, removing, and invoking multiple callback functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data when invoking handlers via the __call__ method, passing arguments to callback functions.",
  "sinks": "Callbacks are called with *args and **kwargs, which could potentially be manipulated if external input is passed into the call method.",
  "flows": "External data (if any) is fed into the __call__ method and propagated to all registered handlers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The use of dynamic function handling appears standard. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that manages a set of callback functions, allowing addition and removal through operator overloading (__iadd__ and __isub__). When the class instance is called, it executes all registered callbacks with provided arguments. The code appears to be a generic event handling utility. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. It does not interact with external systems or secrets. The use of typing annotations and logging is standard. Overall, the code is straightforward and does not contain malicious or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard event handler container without any malicious intent. It manages callback functions securely without exposing secrets or performing harmful actions. No security risks are identified.",
