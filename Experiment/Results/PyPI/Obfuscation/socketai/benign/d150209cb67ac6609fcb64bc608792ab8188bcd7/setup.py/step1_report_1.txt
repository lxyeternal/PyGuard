  "purpose": "To configure the package setup using setuptools for distribution.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only static code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code simply calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious behavior, no hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls setup() with default arguments, which is standard practice for Python packaging. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or obfuscated code. The code's simplicity suggests it is just a minimal setup script without any malicious intent or hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, benign setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security issues.",
