{
  "purpose": "To configure and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leakage points observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; the code simply calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and executes it with default parameters. This is a standard pattern for packaging Python projects. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or data exfiltration. The code's simplicity reduces risk of malicious activity. No external inputs, no data manipulation, and no suspicious function calls are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a typical package setup with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard boilerplate code for Python packaging.",
