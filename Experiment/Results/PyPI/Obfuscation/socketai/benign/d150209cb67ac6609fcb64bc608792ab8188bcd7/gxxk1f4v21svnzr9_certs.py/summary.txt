  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for generating self-signed certificates, with superficial obfuscation and some coding practices that could be improved. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or sabotage. The main concern is the file mode used for writing keys and certs, which should be 'wb' instead of 'ab' to prevent data corruption. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent."
