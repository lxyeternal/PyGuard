  "purpose": "Generate a self-signed X.509 certificate with an optional separate private key, for local use or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads hostname via socket.gethostname(); reads/writes files in specified directory; generates RSA key; resolves hostname to IP; uses cryptography library for certificate creation.",
  "sinks": "Writes private key and certificate PEM files to disk.",
  "flows": "Host info from socket.gethostname() flows into certificate subject and SANs; hostname resolution may resolve to IP; generated key and certificate are saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious hardcoded secrets; the code writes private keys and certificates to files, but this is typical for such functionality. No obfuscated code or malicious network activity is present. The logging level is debug, which is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code generates an RSA private key and creates a self-signed certificate with multiple SANs, including localhost, local domain, and hostname IP address. It saves the private key separately or combined based on parameter. It resolves the hostname to an IP, with error handling if resolution fails. The process appears typical for local certificate generation. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or network-based attacks. The use of cryptography library is legitimate for this purpose. The file writing to disk is straightforward and expected in certificate generation scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard cryptographic operations to generate a self-signed certificate and private key, intended for local or testing environments. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The code appears benign and typical for certificate creation scripts.",
