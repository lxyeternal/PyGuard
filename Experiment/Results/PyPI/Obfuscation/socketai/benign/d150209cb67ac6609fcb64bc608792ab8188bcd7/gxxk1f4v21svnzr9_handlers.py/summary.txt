  "conclusion": "The code is a standard SMTP authentication handler with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The current security risk score of 0.2 and malware score of 0 are appropriate. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent."
