{
  "purpose": "This code generates synthetic data for clustering, using randomization and statistical distributions.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as number of samples, number of centers, cluster standard deviation, and optional input data or random seed.",
  "sinks": "Generated datasets (features and labels) returned by the function; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Data generation process -> Output datasets (features and labels).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code primarily performs data generation with standard libraries. No suspicious data leaks, network activity, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function for synthetic data generation for clustering tasks. It uses standard functions from numpy and sklearn, checks input types, handles parameters flexibly, and shuffles data if requested. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. The randomness is controlled via check_random_state, which is standard. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to data science workflows. There are no obfuscation techniques or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard, legitimate data generation function without malicious intent. No security risks, malware, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
