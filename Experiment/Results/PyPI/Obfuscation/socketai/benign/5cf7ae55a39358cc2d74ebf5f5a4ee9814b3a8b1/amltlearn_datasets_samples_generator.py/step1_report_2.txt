  "purpose": "This code generates synthetic clustered data for testing or simulation purposes, allowing configuration of cluster number, standard deviation, and data range.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as sefAmNarCfBmEOJsApGwwImbatFvSPpP, fIkUsJGRHLuuMpyeWbbYwQFgVXdlHFxJ, OrgyfiUkWzqbmsQXGrgJOfCymyuWxmEd, cluster_std, and random_state.",
  "sinks": "None of the parameters or functions directly send data externally or access untrusted sources. No data leaks or insecure data handling identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate data points via numpy random functions, with optional shuffling of the resulting arrays.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains obfuscated variable names, no comments, and uses dynamic checks and array manipulations that may obscure intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily defines a function to create clustered data points with customizable parameters, employing numpy for randomness and sklearn utilities for validation. It performs input validation, generates data points centered around specified means with added Gaussian noise, and optionally shuffles the data. No external communication, code injection, or suspicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated variable names hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malware signatures detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data generator for clustering simulations. It contains obfuscation that complicates analysis but does not suggest malicious activity or security risks.",
