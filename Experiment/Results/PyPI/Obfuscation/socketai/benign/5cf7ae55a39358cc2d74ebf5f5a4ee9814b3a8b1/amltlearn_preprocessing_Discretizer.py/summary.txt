  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated data discretization utility with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) reflects the confusing naming and structure. The malware score remains at 0, as no malicious routines are detected. The security risk is low (~0.4), primarily due to obfuscation and minor bugs, but no active threats are present."
