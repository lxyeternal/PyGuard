  "purpose": "Heavily obfuscated Python class implementing data discretization (binning) methods, likely used for preprocessing in machine learning pipelines.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays passed into methods such as 'vphHHsSEhMuMuGAYaoPagGwTlfNrBHJD', 'QKzjuDiwOsskBsAjMorsrNNaYhKaFpIz', and 'OiGxWYVpgSSulUhzuDhvicynQJngrFjm'.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, file operations, or system commands detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input numpy arrays through discretization methods, with internal calculations and modifications, but no external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an undefined variable 'i' in method 'AeDKEBEFGKhQAbxJYcEjBTChOJGoFTQi' suggests incomplete or obfuscated code; multiple methods contain obfuscated, meaningless names; small epsilon constants added for numerical stability.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless class and method names, making interpretation difficult. It implements two discretization strategies: equal-width and frequency-based binning. The presence of an undefined variable 'i' indicates either incomplete code or obfuscation. No network, file, or system commands are present, and no malicious routines such as data exfiltration or system manipulation are evident. The obfuscation appears intentional, possibly to conceal malicious intent, but static analysis reveals no active malicious payloads. The small epsilon additions are standard for numerical stability, not malicious. The code's core functionality is benign, but its obfuscated nature warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated data discretization utility with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) reflects the confusing naming and structure. The malware score remains at 0, as no malicious routines are detected. The security risk is low (~0.4), primarily due to obfuscation and minor bugs, but no active threats are present.",
