  "purpose": "Module setup defining class exports with an obfuscated variable.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string to an unused variable; import statements from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated variable assignment does not influence any data flow; imports are static.",
  "anomalies": "Unused obfuscated variable; 'KnnImputer' included in __all__ but not imported, which could cause runtime errors.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears to serve as a package's __init__.py or setup file. The obfuscated variable 'LMOsPnlroXGUGLmavCnbtemLoITDVkjj' is assigned a string but not used elsewhere, indicating obfuscation or placeholder code. Import statements are standard, but the inclusion of 'KnnImputer' in __all__ without an import suggests a potential oversight. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are present. The malware score is correctly zero; obfuscation is moderate to high, but not malicious; security risk is very low. The code does not exhibit any security vulnerabilities or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module setup with an unnecessary obfuscated variable. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears to be superficial and does not pose a security threat.",
