  "purpose": "Define module exports for Discretizer and KnnImputer classes, importing them from local modules.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string to variable 'LMOsPnlroXGUGLmavCnbtemLoITDVkjj', import statements for classes from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed; no network, file, or environment variable usage present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is limited to variable assignment and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated variable name 'LMOsPnlroXGUGLmavCnbtemLoITDVkjj' with an arbitrary string value. Import statements from local modules are normal but the variable is unusual and seemingly meaningless.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a seemingly arbitrary string to a variable with a non-descriptive name, which might be obfuscation or an artifact. It imports two classes from local modules and defines __all__ for module exports. There is no network activity, no handling of untrusted input, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors. The obfuscated variable does not interact with other parts of the code and appears to serve no apparent purpose. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward module setup with an unusual variable assignment but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a module setup with normal import statements and an unrelated, obfuscated variable assignment. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues are detected. The obfuscated variable seems unnecessary but not harmful.",
