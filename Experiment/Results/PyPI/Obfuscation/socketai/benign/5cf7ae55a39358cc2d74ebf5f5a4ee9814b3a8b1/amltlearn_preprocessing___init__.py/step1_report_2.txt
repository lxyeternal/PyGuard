{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module exports for a package, specifically exposing 'Discretizer' and 'KnnImputer' classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules '.Discretizer' and '.Imputer'; assignment of a string to an obfuscated variable.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or output actions observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements load classes from local modules, and the variable assignment is isolated with no further use.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated variable name 'LMOsPnlroXGUGLmavCnbtemLoITDVkjj' assigned to a static string 'bejar'; no other code actions or logic. No signs of malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up module exports with __all__, importing two classes from local modules. The variable 'LMOsPnlroXGUGLmavCnbtemLoITDVkjj' is assigned a string value but is not used elsewhere, which could be an obfuscation attempt or placeholder. There are no sources or sinks involved in data processing, no external inputs, or malicious actions evident. The code does not contain malicious payloads or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module setup with an obfuscated variable that does not affect functionality. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
