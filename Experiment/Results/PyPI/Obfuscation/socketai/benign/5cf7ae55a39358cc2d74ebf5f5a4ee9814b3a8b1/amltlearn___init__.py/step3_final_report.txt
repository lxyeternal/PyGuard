  "purpose": "Static assignment of a string 'bejar' to an obfuscated variable name.",
  "sources": "The variable assignment itself; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data sinks or outputs involved.",
  "flows": "Single source (assignment) with no data flow to other parts of code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name, but no malicious or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No inputs, outputs, external calls, or dynamic behaviors are present. All reports agree that there is no malicious activity, data leakage, or security risk. Obfuscation is noted but not indicative of malicious intent in this isolated context. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score is high due to variable naming, but this alone does not imply maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a simple static assignment with obfuscated variable naming. No evidence of malicious behavior or security threats is present. The obfuscation does not necessarily indicate malicious intent in this context.",
