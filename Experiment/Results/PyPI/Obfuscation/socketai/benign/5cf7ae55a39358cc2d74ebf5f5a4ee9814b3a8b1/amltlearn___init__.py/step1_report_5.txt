  "anomalies": "Use of a nonsensical, obfuscated variable name; no clear purpose or context",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string 'bejar' to a variable with an intentionally obfuscated name. There are no input sources, no data flows, or operations that could lead to malicious actions. The variable name appears designed to conceal intent, but there is no active malicious behavior or suspicious activity evident from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple variable assignment with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks present in this fragment.",
