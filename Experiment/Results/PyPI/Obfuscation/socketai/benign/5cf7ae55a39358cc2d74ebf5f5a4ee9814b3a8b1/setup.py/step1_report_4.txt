  "purpose": "Set up and package a Python project with specified name, version, and license.",
  "sources": "The setup() function call reading package name, version, and license from code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Input data (name, version, license) flows directly into the setup() function without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'distutils.core' instead of the more modern 'setuptools' is notable but not suspicious. The package name appears to be a random string, which is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from 'distutils.core' and calls it with static, hardcoded parameters: name, version, and license. There are no inputs from external sources, user inputs, environment variables, or network activity. The structure is straightforward and standard for packaging, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious code. The use of 'distutils' over 'setuptools' is outdated but not malicious. The package name appears random and potentially suspicious, but on its own, this is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a basic packaging setup with hardcoded values, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The randomness of the package name is unusual but not harmful. Overall, the script is benign.",
