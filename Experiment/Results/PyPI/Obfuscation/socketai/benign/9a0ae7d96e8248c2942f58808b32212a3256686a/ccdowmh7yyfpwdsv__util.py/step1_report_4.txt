{
  "purpose": "This code provides utility functions for formatting byte sizes and computing SHA-256 hashes, with optional support for the humanize library.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the input parameters: 'bytes' for size formatting and 'upjaeKNFGByeVIvsJjGOtRoJmGyWNcuR' for hashing, which can be any buffer-like object.",
  "sinks": "The code writes formatted size strings and hash digest bytes. No untrusted data is sent to external systems or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters ('bytes' and 'upjaeKNFGByeVIvsJjGOtRoJmGyWNcuR') to formatting functions and hash digest output; no external or network transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic import with fallback, and reliance on an optional external library (humanize) may suggest an attempt to conceal intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one for formatting byte sizes, optionally using the 'humanize' library, and another for computing SHA-256 hash of a buffer. The variable names are obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The import fallback is common for optional dependencies. There are no network calls, no file operations, or suspicious code injections. The code appears to be utility functions with no malicious intent or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as benign utility functions for size formatting and hashing, with obfuscated naming and optional library use. No malware or security threats are evident based on this isolated code snippet.",
