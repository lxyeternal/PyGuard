{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for formatting byte sizes and hashing byte data, likely for use in larger applications.",
  "sources": "Reading of input data occurs when the function gVTkxLQCvqlNiKDmZpPhtSczdEpvzdDx is called with a Buffer object; the import of humanize may involve external data or configuration.",
  "sinks": "The hashing function gVTkxLQCvqlNiKDmZpPhtSczdEpvzdDx outputs digest bytes; no immediate data leaks or external communication are evident.",
  "flows": "Input Buffer data flows from the function parameter to the hashlib.sha256 digest computation, producing a hash output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names, no visible hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no obfuscated logic are noted. The optional import of 'humanize' is standard and harmless. No suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and attempts to import 'humanize', handling import failure gracefully. It defines a function to format byte sizes, utilizing 'humanize' if available, otherwise defaults to a simple string format. Another function hashes input data using SHA-256, ensuring the input is a memoryview for efficiency. All functions perform typical, benign operations without malicious intent or behavior. No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for formatting and hashing data, with no indicators of malicious activity or security risks.",
