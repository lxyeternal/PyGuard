{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for formatting byte sizes and computing SHA-256 hashes from memory buffers.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments: 'bytes' parameter for size formatting, and 'upjaeKNFGByeVIvsJjGOtRoJmGyWNcuR' buffer for hashing.",
  "sinks": "The hash function outputs binary digest; no data is sent over network or stored. Size formatting returns a string, no untrusted output source beyond input parameters.",
  "flows": "Input size flows into formatting function; memory buffer flows into hash digest generation. No external or untrusted data sources, no data leakage or transmission observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; conditional import of 'humanize' library with fallback. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. The code appears purpose-driven with minimal suspicious structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a size formatting function that optionally uses 'humanize' for better display, with fallback to simple formatting. It also defines a SHA-256 hashing function that ensures input is a memoryview, then computes the hash digest. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, no data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation seems to be for code concealment but not malicious per se. The overall logic is benign and consistent with utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module for size formatting and hashing. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified. Obfuscated variable names are likely for concealment but do not imply malicious intent.",
