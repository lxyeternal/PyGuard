  "purpose": "Utility functions for formatting byte sizes into human-readable strings and computing SHA-256 hashes of input buffers.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions: 'bytes' for size formatting, 'upjaeKNFGByeVIvsJjGOtRoJmGyWNcuR' buffer for hashing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; functions return formatted strings or digest bytes without external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions, processed internally, and outputs are returned; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; dynamic import of 'humanize' with fallback; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides benign utility functions for size formatting and hashing, with obfuscated naming possibly for concealment but no malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact security. Scores from reports are consistent; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate (0.7), and security risk is low (0.1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility module with obfuscated variable names, performing standard functions without malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0.0.",
