  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Findings:** Utility functions for size formatting and hashing; no malicious behavior; obfuscation appears benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.8.  \n- **Assessment:** The high obfuscation score is justified due to the variable and function names, but no malicious activity is detected. The low security risk aligns with benign utility functions.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar utility functions; optional 'humanize' import; no malicious activity; obfuscation present but benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.0.  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower obfuscation score, consistent with the code. No malware, and low security risk.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Findings:** Obfuscated variable names, dynamic import, but no malicious behavior; functions are benign.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.7.  \n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation score is high, justified by variable naming and import style, but no malicious intent is evident.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Findings:** Similar benign utility functions; obfuscation present but no malicious activity.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.8.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior reports; obfuscation is notable but not malicious.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Findings:** Same pattern—benign functions, obfuscation, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.7.  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent with other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0.0, and the code is straightforward utility functions with no signs of malicious activity. No external network activity, no code injection, no hardcoded secrets, and no suspicious behavior.  \n  **My assessment:** **Malware score should remain at 0.0.**\n\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The variable and function names are intentionally obscure, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The import fallback and dynamic import could be for compatibility or concealment.  \n  **My assessment:** Given the consistent obfuscation but benign behavior, an obfuscated score of around **0.7** seems appropriate, possibly slightly lower if considering the obfuscation as a minor concern. I would suggest **0.7**.\n\n- **Risk Score:** The overall security risk is low; no vulnerabilities, backdoors, or malicious activity detected. The obfuscation alone doesn't elevate the risk significantly.  \n  **My assessment:** A risk score of **0.1** is justified, aligning with the reports.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my estimates:**\n\n| Metric             | Score  |\n|--------------------|---------|\n| Malware            | **0.0**   |\n| Obfuscated         | **0.7**   |\n| Security Risk      | **0.1**   |\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be utility functions with obfuscated variable names, possibly for concealment or code complexity, but without any malicious intent or behavior. The scores should reflect this understanding.",
