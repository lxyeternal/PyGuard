  "purpose": "The code appears to provide utility functions for formatting byte sizes and computing SHA-256 hashes on byte buffers.",
  "sources": "Reading data from the input parameter 'upjaeKNFGByeVIvsJjGOtRoJmGyWNcuR' in 'gVTkxLQCvqlNiKDmZpPhtSczdEpvzdDx' function.",
  "sinks": "The 'hashlib.sha256' digest could be used for integrity checks or data fingerprinting; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input buffer flows from 'upjaeKNFGByeVIvsJjGOtRoJmGyWNcuR' into hashlib.sha256 for hashing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and function names. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior evident. The code is straightforward and uses standard libraries.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to format byte sizes into a human-readable string, optionally using the 'humanize' library if available. It also defines a function to compute a SHA-256 hash from a memoryview of bytes. No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. The use of obfuscated variable names appears intentional but does not indicate malicious intent. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious data handling present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard utility functions: formatting byte sizes and hashing data. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks identified. The obfuscation appears to be solely for naming complexity, not malicious intent.",
