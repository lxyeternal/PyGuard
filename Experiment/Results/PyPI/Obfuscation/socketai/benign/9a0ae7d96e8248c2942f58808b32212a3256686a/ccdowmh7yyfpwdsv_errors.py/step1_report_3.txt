{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception and warning classes with obfuscated names and seemingly random string attributes, possibly intended to be used for exception handling or warnings.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class attribute assignments; no input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows involving untrusted input; no external data transmission or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; classes are defined with static string attributes, no methods or runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The class and attribute names are highly obfuscated, consisting of random strings, which is unusual for standard Python code. No meaningful logic or data handling is visible. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code indicators are evident. The attributes are simple static strings without apparent purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations with obfuscated names and static string attributes. There are no functions, input reading, or external data interactions. The classes inherit from built-in exception or warning types, possibly to be used for custom exception handling or warnings, but the code itself contains no logic or behavior. The obfuscation may be intended to hide malicious intent, but without further context or behavior, it appears as a benign placeholder or deliberately obfuscated code that could be misused if combined with malicious logic elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated class declarations with no inherent malicious behavior or security risks. There are no signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious actions. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution if used in larger, less transparent codebases.",
