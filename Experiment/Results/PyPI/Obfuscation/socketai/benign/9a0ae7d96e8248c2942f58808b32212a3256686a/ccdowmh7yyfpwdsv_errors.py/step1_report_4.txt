  "purpose": "Define custom exception and warning classes with obfuscated class names and string attributes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string attribute initializations",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data processing, network activity, or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; no execution flow involving external data or untrusted inputs",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated class names and string attributes that seem intentionally meaningless, with no apparent functionality or logic",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple class definitions inheriting from built-in exceptions and warning classes, with class names and attribute values obfuscated as random strings. There are no methods, data processing, network calls, or input/output operations. The structure appears to be intentionally obscured, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or sabotage. The code does not perform any actions or logic that could harm, compromise, or leak data. It seems more likely to be obfuscated or placeholder code rather than malicious malware or security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is heavily obfuscated class definitions with no functional or malicious activity detected. No suspicious behaviors or security risks are evident. It appears to be intentionally obscured but does not pose an immediate threat.",
