  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate codec resolution utility with high obfuscation and potential security risks stemming from dynamic invocation of untrusted callables. No malware or malicious payloads are detected, but the recursive, flexible design could be exploited if misused. Proper input validation and cautious deployment are recommended."
