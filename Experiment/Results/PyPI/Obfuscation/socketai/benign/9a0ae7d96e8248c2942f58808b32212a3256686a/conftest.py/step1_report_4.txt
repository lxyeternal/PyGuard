{
  "purpose": "Configure hypothesis testing settings and initialize a numpy random generator for use in tests.",
  "sources": "np.random.default_rng() within the fixture function, and hypothesis.settings and profile registration calls.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or untrusted data processing; no output or network activity.",
  "flows": "The fixture function provides a numpy random generator object for test data generation; no data flows outside the test setup code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or hidden behaviors. The code only configures testing parameters and initializes a generator.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard testing and scientific libraries, registers multiple hypothesis testing profiles with different parameters, and defines a fixture that provides a numpy random generator. All operations are typical for setting up testing environments. No suspicious data handling, no malicious commands, and no obfuscated code are present. The code appears purely for test configuration and setup.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard testing setup script that configures hypothesis testing profiles and initializes a numpy RNG fixture. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
