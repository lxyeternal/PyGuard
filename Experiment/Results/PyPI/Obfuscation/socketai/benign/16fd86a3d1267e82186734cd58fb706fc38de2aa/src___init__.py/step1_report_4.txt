  "purpose": "Define and set up plugin management and hook implementation markers for a testing framework.",
  "sources": "Import statements for a specific class from a local module and a third-party library, and a variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data can lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not involve untrusted data; the variable assignment is straightforward and static.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unusually named class imported from a local module, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, but could also be legitimate. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially obscure class from a local module, which could be normal in some contexts but also could indicate hiding malicious behavior. The use of a third-party marker for hooks is standard in plugin systems. The __all__ list specifies exported symbols, which is typical. There are no apparent data flows involving untrusted input or dangerous operations. No malicious code or backdoors are detectable from the static code alone. The code structure and content appear straightforward and typical for plugin configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for plugin management with no clear signs of malicious intent. The obscure class name could warrant further inspection of the local module, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious behavior is evident.",
