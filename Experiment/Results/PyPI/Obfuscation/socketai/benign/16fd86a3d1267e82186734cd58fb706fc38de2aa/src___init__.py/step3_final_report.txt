  "purpose": "Set up plugin management and hook markers for testing framework integration.",
  "sources": "Import of obfuscated class 'PNMMXuHRuuUmgUYEjrCirlRgSrBMAkOM' from 'testit_pytest.plugin_manager'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communications present.",
  "flows": "Import of class (source) does not lead to any data flow or execution within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name imported but not used; 'TestITPluginManager' included in __all__ but not defined or imported; potential incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated class, assigns a hook marker, and defines an export list. No malicious actions or data leaks are evident. The obfuscated class name raises suspicion but could be benign. The undefined 'TestITPluginManager' suggests incomplete code. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.6-0.7, risk=0.2) are consistent with the static analysis. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which warrants further review of the actual class implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard plugin setup with obfuscated identifiers. No active malicious behavior or data leaks are detected. The obfuscation justifies a higher suspicion score, but without further context, the code can be considered benign. Further inspection of the imported class source is recommended to confirm its legitimacy.",
