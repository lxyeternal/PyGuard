  "purpose": "Utility functions for packaging data into dictionaries, likely for testing or configuration management, with obfuscated method and variable names.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to static methods, which are then assembled into dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into dictionary values within each method.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated method and variable names; no validation or sanitization of inputs; no malicious code or payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static methods that package provided parameters into dictionaries, serving as data containers. Names are obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No external communication, code injection, or data exfiltration is observed. The functions are straightforward and do not process data insecurely. Given the absence of malicious payloads, network activity, or system manipulation, the code appears benign. Obfuscation is notable but not suspicious in this context. The scores assigned in the original reports—malware=0, low to moderate security risk, high obfuscation—are consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for data structuring with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, external communication, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants some caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The original scoring is appropriate; however, the obfuscated score could be slightly increased to reflect the obfuscation more strongly, while keeping malware and risk scores minimal.",
