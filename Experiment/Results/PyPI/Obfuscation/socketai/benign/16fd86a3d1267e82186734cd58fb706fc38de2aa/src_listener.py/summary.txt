  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, complex testing/reporting utility that does not exhibit malicious behavior but employs practices (obfuscation, pickle serialization, dynamic attribute manipulation) that pose moderate security risks. No evidence of malware or sabotage is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score remains low due to lack of malicious payloads. The risk score reflects potential exploitation avenues, primarily through pickle. Overall, the code appears legitimate but warrants caution regarding its serialization and obfuscation practices."
