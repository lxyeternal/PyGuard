  "purpose": "Configure pytest plugin options and register a plugin based on command-line arguments, with obfuscated variable names and hardcoded tokens.",
  "sources": "Command-line options, hardcoded tokens, and configuration parameters within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of hardcoded tokens and obfuscated variables that could be misused if secrets are sensitive.",
  "flows": "Options are read from command-line inputs and used to instantiate and register plugin objects, with no network or system modifications observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, presence of hardcoded secrets (e.g., token 'T2lKd2pLZGI4WHRhaVZUejNl'), and suspicious string literals that may conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up pytest options and registers a plugin, with obfuscation and hardcoded secrets raising suspicion. No active malicious actions such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification are evident. The obfuscation and embedded secrets suggest concealment but do not confirm malicious intent. The code's structure is typical for plugin configuration, but obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard pytest plugin setup with obfuscated identifiers and some hardcoded secrets. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware risk remains low. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation and secrets, but active malicious behavior is not demonstrated.",
