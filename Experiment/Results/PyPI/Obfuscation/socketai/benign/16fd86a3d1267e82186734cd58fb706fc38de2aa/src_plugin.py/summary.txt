  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard pytest plugin setup with obfuscated identifiers and some hardcoded secrets. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware risk remains low. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation and secrets, but active malicious behavior is not demonstrated."
