  "purpose": "Configure Python package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for distribution.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated string literals assigned to parameters and variables, such as 'ZvpvbOaMhjpHPMpiAgpnyRLjoUinUiYD', 'RBCxdhHIvuUneJJKHGdacPEqRtANLQWo', and 'mzvwoj08wk8turq0'.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of suspicious strings to parameters that could be used as secrets or payloads; no direct data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated strings and keys are assigned to parameters and variables, potentially hiding malicious payloads; no dynamic or network flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of nonsensical, obfuscated-looking string literals and variable names; hardcoded string 'mzvwoj08wk8turq0' assigned to a parameter key; lack of meaningful variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup script with obfuscated strings and nonsensical variable names, including a suspicious string 'mzvwoj08wk8turq0' that resembles a secret or payload. No active malicious behavior, network activity, or code execution is evident. The obfuscation and hardcoded secrets raise suspicion, but static analysis alone cannot confirm malicious intent. The high obfuscation scores across reports are justified, and the elevated malware score in report 5 reflects suspicion of hidden secrets or payloads. Overall, the code warrants cautious review, with potential hidden secrets or malicious payloads embedded within obfuscated strings.",
  "conclusion": "The static code analysis indicates a standard setup script with significant obfuscation and suspicious hardcoded strings, notably 'mzvwoj08wk8turq0'. While no active malicious activity is confirmed, the obfuscation and embedded secrets justify a moderate to high suspicion level. The malware score should be low (around 0.2), but the obfuscation and potential hidden payloads warrant further investigation before trusting or deploying this package.",
