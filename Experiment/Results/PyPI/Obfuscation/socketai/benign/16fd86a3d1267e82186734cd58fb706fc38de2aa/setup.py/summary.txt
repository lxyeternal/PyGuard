  "conclusion": "The static code analysis indicates a standard setup script with significant obfuscation and suspicious hardcoded strings, notably 'mzvwoj08wk8turq0'. While no active malicious activity is confirmed, the obfuscation and embedded secrets justify a moderate to high suspicion level. The malware score should be low (around 0.2), but the obfuscation and potential hidden payloads warrant further investigation before trusting or deploying this package."
