      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The static code analysis indicates a standard setup script with significant obfuscation and suspicious hardcoded strings, notably 'mzvwoj08wk8turq0'. While no active malicious activity is confirmed, the obfuscation and embedded secrets justify a moderate to high suspicion level. The malware score should be low (around 0.2), but the obfuscation and potential hidden payloads warrant further investigation before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "This module is a benign static import setup with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware or active security threats. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious in this context. Further investigation into 'testit_pytest.utils' is recommended if additional context suggests malicious intent."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, complex testing/reporting utility that does not exhibit malicious behavior but employs practices (obfuscation, pickle serialization, dynamic attribute manipulation) that pose moderate security risks. No evidence of malware or sabotage is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score remains low due to lack of malicious payloads. The risk score reflects potential exploitation avenues, primarily through pickle. Overall, the code appears legitimate but warrants caution regarding its serialization and obfuscation practices."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward plugin management utility with obfuscated naming, no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The primary concern is the potential risk from dynamically loaded plugins and the use of getattr, which could be exploited if untrusted plugins are introduced. Overall, the code appears benign, with risk levels primarily related to plugin trustworthiness rather than the code itself."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for data structuring with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, external communication, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants some caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The original scoring is appropriate; however, the obfuscated score could be slightly increased to reflect the obfuscation more strongly, while keeping malware and risk scores minimal."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard plugin setup with obfuscated identifiers. No active malicious behavior or data leaks are detected. The obfuscation justifies a higher suspicion score, but without further context, the code can be considered benign. Further inspection of the imported class source is recommended to confirm its legitimacy."

The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware risk remains low. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation and secrets, but active malicious behavior is not demonstrated."

The obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious review, but current analysis indicates a benign purpose. Malware score is set to 0.1, obfuscation score to 0.6, and security risk to 0.3, reflecting low malicious risk but moderate obfuscation complexity."

There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The main risks stem from obfuscation and unsafe eval usage, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Overall, it warrants caution and further review before deployment."
