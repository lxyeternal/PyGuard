{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and variables from a module named 'testit_pytest.utils' and defines the '__all__' list to specify exported names.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'testit_pytest.utils', including multiple functions and variables; also, definitions of '__all__'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data is written to external systems, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Imported functions and variables are assigned to module namespace; '__all__' controls exports but does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers appear as obfuscated or nonsensical names; no actual implementation code is present, and the names do not suggest malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs static imports from a module, then defines an export list. No data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The imported names are obfuscated but do not directly indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be part of a larger framework, likely for test automation, with no suspicious operations or embedded payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a straightforward import and export declaration with obfuscated identifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based solely on this code segment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
