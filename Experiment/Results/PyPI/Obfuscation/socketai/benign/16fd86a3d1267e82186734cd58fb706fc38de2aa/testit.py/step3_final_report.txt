  "purpose": "Static import of functions and variables from 'testit_pytest.utils' and defining __all__ for export.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'testit_pytest.utils' with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, external communication, or dynamic data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements to module namespace; no data flow beyond static import.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers; no runtime anomalies or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports of multiple functions/variables with obfuscated names, then declares __all__ for exports. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing is present. The obfuscated names could be for internal or obfuscation purposes but do not indicate malicious intent. The high confidence scores reflect the static, benign nature. No signs of malware such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are evident. The obfuscation warrants caution but is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The security risk remains very low, and the overall code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a benign static import setup with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware or active security threats. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious in this context. Further investigation into 'testit_pytest.utils' is recommended if additional context suggests malicious intent.",
