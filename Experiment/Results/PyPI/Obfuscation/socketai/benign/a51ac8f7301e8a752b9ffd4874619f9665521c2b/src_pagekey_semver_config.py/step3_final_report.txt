  "flows": "yaml.safe_load input -> merge function -> model instantiation",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated module and variable names, but no malicious code or network activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading, merging external YAML data with environment variables, and instantiating data models. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The obfuscated names may suggest code obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent. The data flow is typical for configuration routines, and no hardcoded secrets or credentials are found. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is moderate to high, justified by the naming patterns; security risk is low due to lack of malicious activity. The confidence in benign assessment is high (above 0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration loader with obfuscated naming, no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the code's behavior.",
