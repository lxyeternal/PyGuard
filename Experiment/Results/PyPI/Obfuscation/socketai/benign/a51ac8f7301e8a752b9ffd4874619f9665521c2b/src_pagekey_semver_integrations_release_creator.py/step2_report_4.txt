  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  No. The code is straightforward, performing API requests for release posting, with tokens retrieved from environment variables.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, mistakes?**  \n  No evident errors. The code uses standard practices, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious constructs.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security Risk: 0.2 — reasonable given token handling.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0 — correct.\n\n- **Risk justification:**  \n  The code does not perform malicious actions; it automates release posting, which is typical in CI/CD pipelines.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, with consistent findings.  \n- No issues detected, tokens are handled via environment variables, and API requests are standard.\n\n- Scores are aligned with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Again, similar pattern: release automation, environment variables for tokens, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior.\n\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Same conclusion: legitimate release automation code, standard practices, no signs of malicious activity.\n\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same as above, no anomalies or malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Code confirmation:**  \n  The code snippets are consistent across reports, with no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n\n- **Logical flaws or mistakes:**  \n  No errors or flaws are evident. The code is standard for release automation.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  All reports assign malware = 0, obfuscated = 0, and low security risk (0.2). These are reasonable.\n\n- **Potential concerns:**  \n  The only slight concern is the handling of tokens via environment variables, which is standard but always requires secure management outside the code. No issues with the code itself.\n\n- **Assumptions and claims:**  \n  The reports avoid assumptions about malicious intent; they correctly interpret the code as release automation.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n- **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n- **0** — code is clear, with no obfuscation.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n- **0.2** — reflects typical security considerations for handling tokens, but no serious risks identified.\n\n**Additional note:**  \nGiven the code's purpose and the thorough analysis, I agree with the current scores.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe code appears to be a legitimate, standard release automation script with no malicious intent.",
