  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate release automation script for GitHub and GitLab, with no malicious intent or activity. The primary issue is a variable naming bug that affects runtime correctness but not security. The use of environment variables for tokens is standard, and no suspicious behavior is evident. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content."
