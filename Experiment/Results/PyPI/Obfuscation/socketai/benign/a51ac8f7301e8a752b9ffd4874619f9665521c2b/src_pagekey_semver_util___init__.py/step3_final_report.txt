{
  "purpose": "The code reads from environment variables, specifically 'SECRET_KEY', likely for configuration or secret management.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'SECRET_KEY'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no evidence of data exfiltration, logging, or network communication.",
  "flows": "From environment variable into the program's processing; no suspicious flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, suspicious strings, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, reading a secret key from environment variables without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No obfuscation or malicious flows are present. The low complexity and benign pattern justify a low security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score of 0.1 is appropriate, and no further action is necessary.",
