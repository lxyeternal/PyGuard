  "purpose": "Release automation tool for semantic versioning with CI/CD integration, managing version calculations, tagging, and environment interactions.",
  "sources": "CLI argument parsing, environment variables (e.g., CI_COMMIT_BRANCH), external module calls for version management and integrations.",
  "sinks": "External method calls (version bumping, tagging), writing to GITHUB_OUTPUT, environment variable reads, file operations for release signaling.",
  "flows": "Input from CLI args and environment variables flows into external versioning and integration modules, which then influence release steps and output signals.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive class and method names; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious file/network activity observed; reliance on external obfuscated modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard release management functions, including version calculation, tagging, and CI/CD integration. Obfuscation is prominent but appears to serve as a protective or stylistic measure rather than malicious concealment. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or destructive commands are evident. External modules are also obfuscated, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The script's logic aligns with typical release workflows, and no suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, if heavily obfuscated, release automation utility. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in analyzing the code, but the overall security risk remains low. Continuous validation of external dependencies and de-obfuscation for transparency are recommended.",
