  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate, if heavily obfuscated, release automation utility. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in analyzing the code, but the overall security risk remains low. Continuous validation of external dependencies and de-obfuscation for transparency are recommended."
