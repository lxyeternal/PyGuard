  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign, but patterns involving eval/exec with untrusted data and network activity suggest moderate to high risk. Scores should be adjusted upward for reports 4 and 5 to better reflect potential malicious behavior, with overall malware around 0.2-0.3 and risk approximately 0.3-0.7."
