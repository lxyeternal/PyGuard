{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility for processing and displaying data, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include user input or environment variables (if used), but none are explicitly shown in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Output functions such as print() or logging could be sinks, but no untrusted data handling or network communication is evident.",
  "flows": "There are no apparent data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code primarily manipulates internal data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code are present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward data processing tasks without involving external inputs or sensitive operations. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior are identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears benign, and no suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration, network connections, or credential theft are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is simple and appears safe.",
