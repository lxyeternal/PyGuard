  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malicious potential, but Report 5's obfuscation and dynamic features raise suspicion. Slightly increased malware and security risk scores for Report 5 are justified, leading to an overall moderate security posture. Further review of Report 5's actual code is recommended before deployment."
