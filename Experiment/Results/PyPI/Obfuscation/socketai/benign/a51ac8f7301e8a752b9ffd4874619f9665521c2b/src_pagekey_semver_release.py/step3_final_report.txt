{
  "purpose": "The code manages semantic version parsing, comparison, and formatting based on configuration data, primarily for version control or validation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as version strings, configuration data for format and version components, and imported modules providing version constants and models.",
  "sinks": "Internal regex parsing, string formatting, and comparison operations; no external network, file, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Version strings are parsed via regex, then compared or formatted internally based on configuration and version constants.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and class names; dynamic regex construction from configuration data which could be exploited if inputs are malicious; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version parsing, comparison, and formatting with obfuscated naming conventions. Regex operations are dynamically built from configuration, which could pose security risks if inputs are malicious, but no such exploitation is evident. The logic is standard for version management, with no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscation appears stylistic or proprietary rather than malicious. The malware score is 0, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is moderate (around 0.6), justified by the naming style. The security risk score is low (around 0.2), given the benign operations and lack of external effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a version management utility with obfuscated naming but no malicious intent or activity. The dynamic regex based on configuration is a potential risk if inputs are malicious, but no evidence of exploitation exists. The overall assessment indicates a benign utility with moderate obfuscation and low security risk.",
