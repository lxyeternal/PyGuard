  "purpose": "Static configuration for Sphinx documentation, setting variables, metadata, and links.",
  "sources": "Import from sphinx.environment, docutils.utils, and a module attribute from 'idutils'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network activity, no data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Static assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated or randomly named attribute 'caTnXpNoQklZkCWqjPdQGJmdJsyHFjUO' imported from 'idutils'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script with no dynamic behavior. The only suspicious element is the import of an attribute with an obfuscated name, which could be placeholder or auto-generated. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The variable names and structure are consistent with static config files. The obfuscated attribute does not perform any malicious action, and the code does not execute untrusted input or perform harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration with a mildly suspicious obfuscated attribute name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risk. The current malware score of 0 is appropriate. The obfuscated score (around 0.2-0.3) reflects mild suspicion but not malicious intent. The overall security risk is very low. No changes are necessary; the code is safe based on the provided analysis.",
