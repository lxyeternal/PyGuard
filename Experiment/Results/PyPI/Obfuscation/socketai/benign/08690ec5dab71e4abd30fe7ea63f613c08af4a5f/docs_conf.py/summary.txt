  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration with a mildly suspicious obfuscated attribute name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risk. The current malware score of 0 is appropriate. The obfuscated score (around 0.2-0.3) reflects mild suspicion but not malicious intent. The overall security risk is very low. No changes are necessary; the code is safe based on the provided analysis."
