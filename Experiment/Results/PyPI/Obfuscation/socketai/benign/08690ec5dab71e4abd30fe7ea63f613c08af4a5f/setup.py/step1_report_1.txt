  "purpose": "Basic setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; standard setup invocation",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "No data flows; simple setup call without data processing",
  "anomalies": "Lack of additional setup parameters or custom code; very minimal and typical usage",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the 'setup()' function with no arguments. This is a common minimal setup script for packaging Python projects. No suspicious code, data handling, or malicious behavior is present. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious operations are evident. It is a standard, safe pattern used in Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security issues.",
