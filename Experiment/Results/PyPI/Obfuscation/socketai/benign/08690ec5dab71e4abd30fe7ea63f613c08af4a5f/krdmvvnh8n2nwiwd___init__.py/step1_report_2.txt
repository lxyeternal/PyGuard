  "purpose": "Dynamically import and assign attributes from all submodules in a package, possibly for plugin or extension loading.",
  "sources": "pkgutil.walk_packages(__path__), importlib.import_module, dir(), getattr() on imported modules",
  "sinks": "globals() assignment of module attributes, potentially injecting many attributes into the global namespace",
  "flows": "walk_packages() -> import_module() -> dir() -> getattr() -> globals()",
  "anomalies": "The code performs dynamic imports and assigns a large number of attributes to the global namespace without explicit control, which could be used maliciously to execute or override functions or variables.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules dynamically from a package's path, then iterates through all attributes of each module, importing and assigning them to the global namespace if they do not start with an underscore. The use of __path__ and dynamic import with module name formatting indicates flexible module loading. The assignment to globals() makes all module attributes globally accessible, which could be exploited to override functions or inject malicious code. The code does not sanitize imported attributes or restrict what is imported, increasing risk. The warning at the beginning is unrelated to this functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code dynamically loads and exposes all non-private attributes from submodules in a package into the global namespace. While it may be intended for plugin systems, this pattern can be exploited to execute malicious code or override existing functions, especially if the package contains untrusted modules. There are no obvious malicious behaviors such as network activity or file manipulation, but the approach itself poses security risks.",
