  "purpose": "Static configuration mapping identifiers to validation functions and grouping related identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it defines static data structures with hardcoded mappings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; no data leaks or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; the code is purely static with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., wXsbcckVAFoDyXrtddZsuHzmuXNhSDTk, kRBTAUOxIMQDNqMlLjnGRcaSQuSqYfrs) suggest obfuscation, which is suspicious but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, defining lists of identifier types and their validators, with no network, file, or code injection activities. The obfuscated variable names raise suspicion but do not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, reflecting no malicious behavior. The obfuscation scores are high (~0.7-0.8), consistent with variable name obfuscation. Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), appropriate given the static, benign nature. The confidence levels are high, as no active threats are evident. Overall, the code appears to be a benign static configuration with obfuscated variable names, warranting cautious review but not indicating malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static validation configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
