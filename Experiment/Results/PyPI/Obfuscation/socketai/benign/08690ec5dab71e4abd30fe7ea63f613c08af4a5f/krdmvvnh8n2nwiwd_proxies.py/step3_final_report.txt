  "purpose": "Minimal placeholder script declaring UTF-8 encoding with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a comment line indicating encoding.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code does not process or transfer any data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is a simple encoding declaration with no suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal script with only a UTF-8 encoding comment. It contains no functions, variables, data handling, network calls, or obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as 0. Confidence levels are high, reflecting certainty about its harmlessness. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident, and the code cannot perform any harmful actions. The scores are consistent with the content, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal, and contains only an encoding declaration. It poses no security risks or malicious intent, and the scores should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and overall risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
