  "purpose": "The code does not perform any specific function; it only specifies the encoding for the Python source file.",
  "sources": "No data inputs or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No output or data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or processing occurs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a shebang specifying UTF-8 encoding, with no executable logic or suspicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a shebang line indicating UTF-8 encoding. There are no functions, variables, data inputs, outputs, or logic present. Without additional code, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The absence of executable code or external interactions means there are no apparent security risks, malicious behaviors, or anomalies within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, standard encoding declaration with no functional or security concerns. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
