  "purpose": "The code only contains a coding declaration comment and no functional code or logic.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reads present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as there is no executable or functional code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a coding declaration comment with no operational code is unusual for a complete script; potentially incomplete or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains solely a coding declaration comment specifying utf-8 encoding. There are no functions, variables, input/output operations, or executable statements. Without additional code, no data flows, sources, or sinks are present. The minimal content offers no apparent malicious behavior or security issues. The absence of code suggests either an incomplete file or a placeholder. No suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an empty or placeholder Python file with only an encoding declaration. No malicious or security concerns are evident, but due to its minimal nature, the assessment is limited. It is likely benign.",
