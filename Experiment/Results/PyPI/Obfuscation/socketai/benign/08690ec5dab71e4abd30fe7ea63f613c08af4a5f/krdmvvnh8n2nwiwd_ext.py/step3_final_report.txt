  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code snippets related to custom scheme registration, focusing on potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Lambda functions, placeholder strings, obfuscated identifiers, and configuration data within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of placeholder lambdas, use of obfuscated strings, and configuration parameters that could be replaced maliciously.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., scheme names) could be processed through lambdas and used in URL generation or validation, but current code is non-functional placeholders.",
  "anomalies": "Invalid lambda syntax ('lambda value: True else False'), obfuscated strings, placeholder comments, and suspicious identifiers suggest obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code contains repeated invalid lambda syntax ('lambda value: True else False'), which is syntactically incorrect in Python, indicating placeholders or obfuscation. Obfuscated strings and placeholder comments further support this. No active malicious activity, such as network communication or file manipulation, is evident. The scores reflect high obfuscation (0.7-0.8) due to placeholder content, but malware presence is unlikely (score 0-0.2). The overall security risk is low (around 0.2), but the placeholders could be exploited if replaced maliciously. The code appears to be a template or documentation snippet requiring proper implementation before use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a template with obfuscated identifiers and invalid syntax, indicating placeholder or obfuscated content. No active malware or malicious behavior is detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware risk remains low. Caution is advised if these placeholders are replaced with real logic. Overall, the security threat is minimal in its current form.",
