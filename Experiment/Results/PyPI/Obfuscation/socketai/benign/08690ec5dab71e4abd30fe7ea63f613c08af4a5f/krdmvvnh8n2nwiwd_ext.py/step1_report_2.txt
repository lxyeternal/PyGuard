{
  "purpose": "This code provides instructions and example templates for registering custom schemes and their configurations within a Python package, specifically related to 'idutils'.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings, function definitions, and lambda functions defined within the documentation string and code comments.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present in this code snippet, as it mainly consists of documentation and template code. No untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks occurs in this code; it is purely instructional and template-based.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated-looking strings such as 'INbsRcwyAkkjaLRfZBTtPUoTgeuwqcZN', 'ekSQDUJLtHNAsHZFJkCOuBdQJsytsBiT', and 'JILmKpKhEmWPBsCglpBjMvyPDnDaaAFH', which appear to be intentionally obfuscated or placeholders. There are no actual executable malicious commands or code injections present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is mainly a documentation string with example code snippets demonstrating how to register custom schemes with 'idutils'. The lambda functions are placeholders or simplified templates. No dynamic or untrusted data handling is evident. The obfuscated strings suggest placeholder or intentionally obscured content, but there is no active malicious behavior or code execution. The code does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or other suspicious activities.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a template and instructional guide for registering custom schemes in a Python package. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated strings seem to be placeholders, not malicious payloads. Overall, the code appears safe.",
