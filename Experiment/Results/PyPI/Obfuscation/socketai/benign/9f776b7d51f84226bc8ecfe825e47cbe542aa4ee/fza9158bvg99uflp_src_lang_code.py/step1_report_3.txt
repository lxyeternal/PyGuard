{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a language detection utility with methods for validating language codes, detecting language from text, and checking if a language is written right-to-left.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data primarily from function parameters such as 'text', 'lang_code', and 'attempts'. It also accesses class constants representing language codes.",
  "sinks": "The code logs information using MiniLogger; no data is directly written to external sinks like files, databases, or network connections. It returns language codes or boolean values based on detection.",
  "flows": "Input text flows into detection functions (MLNneWqpIKKTFgDXpyobMiPAeQQZfpns, etc.), which process the data and return language codes. Validation functions check these codes against known constants. There are no external data flows outside logging and return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. The language codes are stored as enum values. The functions perform standard language detection and validation. The use of verbose, obfuscated variable names suggests code obfuscation, possibly to disguise intent, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with language codes and methods for language detection and validation. It uses 'langdetect' library for detecting language from text, with attempts and exception handling. It logs activities with a custom logger. The design seems to be a language utility. No network activity, system modifications, or suspicious data handling are observed. The variable names are intentionally obscure, which could be an attempt at obfuscation. However, all operations are standard for language detection. No indicators of malware or malicious data exfiltration are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a language detection and validation utility with obfuscated variable names. It performs safe, well-defined functions without malicious behavior or security risks. Its obfuscation might be to evade simple code inspection, but it does not contain malicious payloads or suspicious data handling.",
