{
  "purpose": "This code defines component metadata including IDs, names, categories, and contact info, primarily for configuration or documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded variable assignments and imported enum values for component categories and testing frameworks.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data inputs or outputs; the code does not process external data or user input.",
  "flows": "The code assigns static values to variables and dictionaries; no data flows from external sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent; no suspicious or unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, setting up static configuration data with no executable logic or network activity. The reports are empty, providing no evidence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. The obfuscation of variable names is mild and likely intentional for code concealment but does not imply malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations are detected. The absence of detailed report data prevents any further risk assessment; scores should be minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The empty reports do not provide any evidence of issues. Therefore, the overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score is zero.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
