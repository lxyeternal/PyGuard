  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing or computation, potentially involving external inputs or dependencies.",
  "sources": "Data sources include imported libraries, environment variables, file reads, or user inputs, though specifics are not provided in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmissions, file writes, system commands, or database queries where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs or external data) to sinks (outputs, network, files, or system commands), possibly through variable assignments or function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function names are detected in the provided code segment. The code appears standard and readable.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including its structure, data handling, and use of dependencies. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity, were observed. The code does not utilize obfuscation, unnecessary dynamic execution, or suspicious imports. Given the lack of external context or specific functions, the analysis relies solely on the visible code. Without evident malicious constructs or anomalies, the overall risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard implementation with no indicators of malware or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal.",
