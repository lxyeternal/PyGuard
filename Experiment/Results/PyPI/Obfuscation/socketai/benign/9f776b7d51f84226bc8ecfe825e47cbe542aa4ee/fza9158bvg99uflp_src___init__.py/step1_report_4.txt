  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a generic script or module that could serve various functions depending on context.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include user input via function parameters or input() calls, environment variables, or external data files (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly present in the provided code fragment.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow is observable within this code snippet; any untrusted data sources and sinks are not directly connected here.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected. The code uses standard syntax and conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward Python script or module with no signs of malicious behavior. It does not perform network operations, system modifications, or data exfiltration. There are no suspicious constructs such as dynamic execution, hidden backdoors, or obfuscated segments. The code's purpose is unclear but seems benign based on its structure and content. Without external context or more code, no malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no indicators of malware or supply chain attacks.",
