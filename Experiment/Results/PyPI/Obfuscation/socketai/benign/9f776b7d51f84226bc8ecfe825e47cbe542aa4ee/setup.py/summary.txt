  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated package setup script with suspicious placeholder usage but no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for misuse if placeholders are replaced maliciously. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). Continuous monitoring or further dynamic analysis is recommended if integrated into larger systems."
