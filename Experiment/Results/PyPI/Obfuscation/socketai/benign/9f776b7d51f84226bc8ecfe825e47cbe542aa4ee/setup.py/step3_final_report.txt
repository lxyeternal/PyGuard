{
  "purpose": "A Python setup script configuring package metadata and dependencies, with obfuscated variable names and placeholder URL components.",
  "sources": "String assignments, variable manipulations, and the setup() function parameters, notably the obfuscated strings and the placeholder '{PACKAGE_NAME}'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the URL with '{PACKAGE_NAME}', which if replaced maliciously, could redirect or mislead; no other sinks observed.",
  "flows": "The obfuscated string is used as the package name; the placeholder in URL is intended to be replaced during deployment; no dynamic code execution or network activity present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of a hardcoded string resembling a token, placeholder '{PACKAGE_NAME}' not replaced, and string manipulation with replace().",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscation and placeholder usage. No active malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or payloads is evident. The obfuscation and placeholder suggest potential concealment or incomplete configuration. The hardcoded string may be benign or a token but is not used maliciously here. The undefined '{PACKAGE_NAME}' indicates incomplete or templated code. Overall, the code is benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation and placeholders.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated package setup script with suspicious placeholder usage but no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for misuse if placeholders are replaced maliciously. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). Continuous monitoring or further dynamic analysis is recommended if integrated into larger systems.",
