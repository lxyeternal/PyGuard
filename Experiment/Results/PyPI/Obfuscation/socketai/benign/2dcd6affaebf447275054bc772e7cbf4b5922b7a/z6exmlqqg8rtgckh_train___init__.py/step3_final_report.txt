  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input reading points, environment variables, module imports, potential network or system calls.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flowing into network functions, system commands, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input to sinks like network connections or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code snippets.",
  "analysis": "All reports describe benign code with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious flows. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.2) are consistent with the descriptions. Limited context or absence of code results in low confidence but appropriate cautious scoring. No evidence suggests malicious intent or supply chain attack.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign based on available information. Scores are appropriate and consistent. No adjustments necessary; overall security posture is low risk.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
