{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear due to lack of comments or documentation; it appears to involve importing modules and setting up some configuration, possibly for a larger application.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from imported modules, environment variables, and possibly from external network sources (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, subprocess executions, or data storage mechanisms (not explicitly shown in provided code).",
  "flows": "Without specific input or data, flow analysis is limited, but generally, data might flow from environment or input to processing functions, then potentially to network or storage.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python features.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only imports and initial setup. No malicious functions, network calls, or data exfiltration routines are visible. It lacks suspicious constructs like dynamic code execution, hidden modules, or secret keys. Since the code snippet is minimal, there is insufficient evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, but due to limited context, a low confidence level is maintained. No obfuscation or malware indications are observed.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
