  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not provided or is unclear due to missing content.",
  "sources": "No identifiable sources of input or data are present in the provided code fragment, likely because the code is missing or empty.",
  "sinks": "There are no observable sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects, as the code is absent or incomplete.",
  "flows": "No data flows can be determined due to lack of code content.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears empty or missing, which is unusual for a code review. No suspicious or anomalous code behavior is observable.",
  "analysis": "The input provided contains no code, only a prompt and empty content. Without code, it is impossible to analyze data sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies. Therefore, no security issues, malware, or obfuscation can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "There is no code to analyze; thus, no malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The empty submission might indicate an error or omission in the provided code.",
