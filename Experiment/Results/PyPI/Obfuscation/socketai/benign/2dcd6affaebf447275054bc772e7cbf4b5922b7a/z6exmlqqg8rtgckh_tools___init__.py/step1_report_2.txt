  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose indicating malicious intent is evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables, functions, or external files (details depend on actual code), but no suspicious or hidden input sources such as network sockets, environment variables, or system info are apparent.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions, file writes, or network transmissions. No suspicious or malicious data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks. No anomalous or hidden flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are observed. No unusual dynamic execution or misleading variable names are present.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code indicates straightforward logic without signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are identified. The code structure is typical of utility or processing scripts. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are detected. The code's behavior aligns with its apparent purpose, and no anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign with standard processing logic.",
