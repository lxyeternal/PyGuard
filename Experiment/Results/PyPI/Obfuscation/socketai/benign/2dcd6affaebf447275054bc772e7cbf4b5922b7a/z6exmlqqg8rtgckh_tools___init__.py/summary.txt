  "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some suspicious features, notably obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a moderate malware score (~0.4) and risk (~0.5). The overall security posture is cautious but not outright malicious. Scores should be slightly increased from initial conservative estimates to better reflect the potential threat posed by obfuscation and dynamic behaviors, while acknowledging the absence of confirmed malicious payloads."
