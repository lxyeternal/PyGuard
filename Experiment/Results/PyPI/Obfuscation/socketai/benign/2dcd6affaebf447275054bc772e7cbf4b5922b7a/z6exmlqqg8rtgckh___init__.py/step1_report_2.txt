  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or variables from a module named 'langid'.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing code from 'langid' module.",
  "sinks": "None directly; no untrusted data handling or output specified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static import only.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are unusually named, with long, seemingly random strings, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three entities with obfuscated or nonsensical names from a local module. No code execution, data input, or network activity is visible. The unusual naming pattern raises suspicion about possible obfuscation or hidden functionality, but without additional context or code, it's not definitively malicious. The import itself is not inherently harmful but warrants caution due to the naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a simple import from a local module using obfuscated names. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in this snippet; however, the naming warrants further review of the 'langid' module to ensure no hidden malicious logic.",
