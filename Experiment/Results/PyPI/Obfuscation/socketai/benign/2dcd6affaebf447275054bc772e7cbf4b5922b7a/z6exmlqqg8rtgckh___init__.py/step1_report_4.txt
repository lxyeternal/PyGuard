  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from the local 'langid' module",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module './langid'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are apparent; the code only performs an import",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements do not constitute data flow",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names such as sYvPvHivnFeoyMkmRqxQVPzkeuYWdHLG, FxoBgZIExavrSwYFWCdbeOKOJdoXwYHe, ANDnSZxelUnvtXAxYUPfmpUlfaIAobfm suggest obfuscated or auto-generated code, which could be suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement importing specific members from a local module. The variable names are highly unconventional and appear to be either obfuscated or randomly generated, which is atypical for standard code. This raises suspicion of potential obfuscation or hidden malicious intent. However, without additional context or content, no direct malicious activity or malware behavior is evident from this snippet alone. There are no external data flows, no suspicious imports, nor any visible malicious commands.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and only performs an import from a local module. The unusual variable names suggest possible obfuscation, which warrants caution. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware based solely on this snippet, but the obfuscation pattern raises suspicion about the code's intent or origin.",
