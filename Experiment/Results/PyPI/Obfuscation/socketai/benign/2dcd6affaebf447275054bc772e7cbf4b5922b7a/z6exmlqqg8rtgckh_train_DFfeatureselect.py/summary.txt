  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, feature extraction script with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation is superficial, and serialization practices are consistent with data processing tasks. Malware risk is effectively zero; security risk remains low due to obfuscation but no active threats are present."
