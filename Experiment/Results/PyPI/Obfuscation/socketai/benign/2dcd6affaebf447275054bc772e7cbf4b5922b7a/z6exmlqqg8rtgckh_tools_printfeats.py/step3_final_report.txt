{
  "purpose": "A data processing script performing feature ranking and output, with heavily obfuscated import and variable names.",
  "sources": "Input file read via an obfuscated function from an obscure module; data loaded into a list.",
  "sinks": "Output written to stdout or specified file; no network or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Data loaded from file -> processed and sorted based on specified column or default -> output generated based on ranking.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import `pJhdwasHhzvNvhBfGbbCwsMpGjMVgTfV`, nonsensical variable and function names, high obfuscation scores.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a feature ranking utility, with no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation suggests concealment, but the core logic is standard data processing. The import from an obscure module and the nonsensical naming are suspicious but do not confirm malicious intent. Scores assigned in reports are consistent with this assessment, with low malware risk (~0.1), high obfuscation (~0.75), and low to moderate risk (~0.2-0.3). Further investigation into the source of the imported modules is recommended to rule out malicious concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is most likely a benign feature ranking utility with obfuscated elements. No concrete evidence of malicious behavior is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware risk remains low. Vigilance should be maintained if the source modules are untrusted.",
