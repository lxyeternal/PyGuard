      "conclusion": "The import statement uses obfuscated identifiers, which is suspicious but not proof of malicious activity. The low malware score is appropriate given the lack of evidence. The high obfuscation score suggests further review of the 'langid' module is necessary. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution and additional investigation."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The dependency exhibits some suspicious features, notably obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting a moderate malware score (~0.4) and risk (~0.5). The overall security posture is cautious but not outright malicious. Scores should be slightly increased from initial conservative estimates to better reflect the potential threat posed by obfuscation and dynamic behaviors, while acknowledging the absence of confirmed malicious payloads."

      "conclusion": "The code is most likely a benign feature ranking utility with obfuscated elements. No concrete evidence of malicious behavior is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware risk remains low. Vigilance should be maintained if the source modules are untrusted."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The script is a complex, obfuscated data processing tool for language models. While the obfuscation and deserialization steps introduce potential security concerns, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The main risk lies in handling external files that could be crafted maliciously, but the code itself does not perform harmful actions."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, feature extraction script with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation is superficial, and serialization practices are consistent with data processing tasks. Malware risk is effectively zero; security risk remains low due to obfuscation but no active threats are present."

      "conclusion": "The script functions as a data pipeline for training language models, with obfuscated variable names and serialization practices that could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No active malicious activity is evident, but the use of pickle and complex data handling introduces moderate security risks. The obfuscation and serialization practices justify a cautious security assessment."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate NLP feature extraction pipeline with significant obfuscation and serialization practices. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or system sabotage. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could be used to conceal malicious payloads, but based on the current analysis, it appears to be a benign data processing routine. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, heavily obfuscated data analysis script for feature importance and information gain calculations. No evidence of malicious activity or payloads is present. The high obfuscation warrants further review of external modules and input data before deployment, but the current assessment indicates low malware risk. The overall security posture is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and unknown external functions, but active malicious behavior is not detected."
