  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for TileDB dataset handling with obfuscation that does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious sabotage are present. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score can be considered moderate (~0.6) due to variable naming. Overall, the code is safe for use with standard input validation and monitoring."
