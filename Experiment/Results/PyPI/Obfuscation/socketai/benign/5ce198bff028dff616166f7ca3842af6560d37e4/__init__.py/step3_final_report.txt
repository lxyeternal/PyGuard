  "purpose": "Module setup for versioning and internal image I/O functions with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Import statements for version info, internal reader and writer modules.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows observed.",
  "flows": "Import source to internal variables; no external or network data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, which are unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import version info with a fallback, then imports internal modules with obfuscated names, and defines __all__ for export. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling is present. Obfuscated names suggest code hiding but are common in proprietary or protected code. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network connections, or code injection are evident. The obfuscation level is high but not necessarily malicious; it could be for code protection or anti-tampering. The malware score is appropriately 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard internal module setup with obfuscated variable names, likely for code concealment or anti-tampering. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not indicate malicious intent.",
