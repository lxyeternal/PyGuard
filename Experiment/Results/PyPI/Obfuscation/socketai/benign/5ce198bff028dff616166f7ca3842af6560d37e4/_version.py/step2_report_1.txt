  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe code that assigns static version strings and tuples to variables with obfuscated names.\n- No dynamic code, input/output, network activity, or suspicious behavior is reported.\n- The variable names are obfuscated but consistent, serving only as metadata.\n- The malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- The security risk scores are very low (mostly 0.1), consistent with benign version assignment code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code correctly assigns version information; no issues with syntax or logic.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None observed; no code execution, external data, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Obfuscation:** Present but not malicious; likely for obscuring variable names, not malicious intent.\n- **Vulnerabilities:** No vulnerabilities are evident; static assignments are harmless.\n\n### Specific points:\n- The **malware scores** are all 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are high (0.7–0.8), reflecting obfuscation but not maliciousness.\n- The **security risk scores** are minimal (0.1), consistent with benign metadata code.\n\n### Potential issues or inconsistencies:\n- The reports uniformly agree that there's no malicious activity, which is accurate.\n- The scores assigned seem reasonable; no need to increase malware or risk scores.\n- The high obfuscation scores are justified due to variable naming, but since the code is benign, these don't indicate a threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0, as no malicious activity is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** High, due to variable naming, which is acceptable.\n- **Risk score:** Very low, consistent with benign version metadata code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are consistent, accurate, and the scoring aligns with the code's nature. No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 (variable names are obfuscated but harmless)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal security risk, just version info)\n\nThis analysis confirms that the code is benign, serving only as version metadata with obfuscated variable names, and poses no security threat.",
