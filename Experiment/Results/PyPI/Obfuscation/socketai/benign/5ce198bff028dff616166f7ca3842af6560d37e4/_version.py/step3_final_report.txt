  "purpose": "Assigns version information to variables with obfuscated names, serving as metadata.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version string and tuple to variables.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, input, or external data sources involved.",
  "flows": "N/A; only static data assignment without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no dynamic code, input/output, or network activity; trivial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static assignments of version info to obfuscated variable names. No dynamic behavior, external data, or malicious patterns are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for code organization or minimal obfuscation, not malicious intent. No vulnerabilities, backdoors, or suspicious activity are evident. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation score is high but justified; security risk is minimal. The code's purpose is benign metadata storage, posing no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as version metadata with superficial obfuscation. There is no malicious activity or security concern. Scores are consistent with the static, metadata-only nature of the code.",
