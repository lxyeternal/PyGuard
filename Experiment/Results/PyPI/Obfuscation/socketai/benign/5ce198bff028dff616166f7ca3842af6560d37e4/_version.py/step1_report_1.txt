  "purpose": "Define version information using obfuscated variable names",
  "sources": "Assignment of obfuscated variables to version strings and tuples",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources identified",
  "flows": "Assignment statements from constants to variables",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and version tuple to variables with obfuscated names. There are no inputs, no dynamic code execution, no network operations, and no data leaks. The code appears to serve as a simple version declaration with obfuscation to hide clarity, which is not inherently malicious but could be part of an obfuscation strategy.\n\nNo signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity are present. The code's structure and content are straightforward and limited to static assignments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple obfuscated version declaration with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It appears to serve as metadata and does not contain malware or security threats.",
