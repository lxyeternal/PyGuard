  "purpose": "Define version information using obfuscated variable names",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reads; only internal variable assignments",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or sensitive operations",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "Use of random-looking variable names that serve no functional purpose; no actual malicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code assigns version strings and tuples to variables with obfuscated names. There are no external data inputs, no untrusted data processing, and no operations indicating malicious intent. The code appears to merely define version metadata in a non-standard, obfuscated manner without any malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code only contains obfuscated variable assignments for version information without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security threats are present based on this code fragment.",
