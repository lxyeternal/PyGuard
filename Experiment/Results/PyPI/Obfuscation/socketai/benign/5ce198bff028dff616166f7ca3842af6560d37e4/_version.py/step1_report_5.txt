  "purpose": "Assign version string and version tuple variables for package versioning",
  "sources": "Code assigns static string and tuple to variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or external data sources identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks",
  "anomalies": "Redundant variable assignment with obfuscated variable names, but no malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '0.0.1' to a variable with an obfuscated name, then reassigns another variable with a different obfuscated name to the same version string and a tuple representing the version. The variable names appear intentionally obscure but are used solely for storing version information. No external inputs, secrets, or malicious constructs are present. No dynamic execution or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple version assignment with obfuscated variable names, likely for code organization or minimal obfuscation purposes. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
