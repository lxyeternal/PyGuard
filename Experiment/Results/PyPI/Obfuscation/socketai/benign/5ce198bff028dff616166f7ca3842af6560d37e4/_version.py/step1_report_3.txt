  "purpose": "The code defines version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements defining version variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points detected.",
  "flows": "Simple variable assignments; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear random or obfuscated; no actual malicious activity, but the variable names seem intentionally obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '0.0.1' to a variable with an obfuscated name and then assigns a tuple (0, 0, 1) to another similarly obscurely named variable. Both variables are linked to version information. There are no inputs, outputs, or behavior indicative of malicious activity. The naming pattern could be intended to hide or obscure the purpose, but it does not imply malicious intent. No other code or logic is present to suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to simply define version information with obfuscated variable names, with no malicious activity or security risks present.",
