  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; variables assigned with static strings and tuples, no suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '0.0.1' to multiple variables and a tuple (0, 0, 1) to another variable. The variable names appear obfuscated but are used consistently. There are no dynamic code execution, input reading, external data fetching, or suspicious behaviors. The code appears to serve as version metadata setup, with no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply assigns static version information to variables with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
