  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate image processing and storage utility with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or risk scores. The current low malware and risk scores are appropriate and should be maintained unless further evidence emerges."
