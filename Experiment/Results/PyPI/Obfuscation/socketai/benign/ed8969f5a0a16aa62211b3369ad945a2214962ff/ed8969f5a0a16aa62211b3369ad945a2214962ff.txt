      "conclusion": "The script appears to be a misconfigured or intentionally obfuscated setup file with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and unusual parameter usage are suspicious but not conclusive of malware. The package should be reviewed for correctness and clarity, and the obfuscated parameter should be corrected to standard arguments."

There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation beyond variable naming, or security vulnerabilities. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, and securityRisk=0.15 are appropriate given the static, non-malicious nature of the code. Overall, the code is safe and intended for legitimate configuration purposes."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a command execution utility with obfuscated identifiers and risky subprocess usage. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware, but the obfuscation and use of 'shell=True' with untrusted inputs could be exploited. The undefined method suggests potential for malicious customizations or simply obfuscation. Overall, moderate security risk exists due to these factors, but no active malware is detected."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The high obfuscation score reflects variable name obscurity but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a build utility for packaging Python applications, with input validation and logging. While obfuscation and dynamic command assembly introduce potential security risks, no evidence of malicious activity is present. The main concern is reliance on external validation functions; if these are weak, command injection could occur. The malware score is low, and the security risk is moderate, primarily due to command construction methods. Overall, the code appears legitimate but warrants caution regarding validation robustness."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign validation utilities with superficial obfuscation in variable names. No malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is approximately 0.2, justified by variable naming. The security risk score is low (~0.1), indicating minimal threat. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
