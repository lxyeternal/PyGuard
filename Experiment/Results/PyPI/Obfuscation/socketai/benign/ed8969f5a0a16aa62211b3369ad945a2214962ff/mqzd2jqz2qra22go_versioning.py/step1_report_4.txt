  "purpose": "Manage and verify software versioning using a configuration file, with version comparison and update functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads version string input; reads and writes to VERSION_LOCK.ini configuration file.",
  "sinks": "File system operations (reading, writing, deleting VERSION_LOCK.ini); user input prompts for build confirmation.",
  "flows": "Input version string -> read/write config file -> compare versions -> possibly delete file -> user prompt -> decide to continue or exit.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic version parsing; user prompts for continuation on version match; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity; standard library functions used securely.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs version management, involving reading, parsing, and comparing version numbers. It uses configparser for config management and performs file operations (create, delete, read). User prompts are used to confirm actions when versions are equal or when current version is less than the last build. No network operations, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, malicious system modification, or remote control mechanisms are present. The only potential concern is the use of input prompts to halt operation, which is benign in context. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or security risks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard version management utility with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs version checks and file manipulations securely, with user interaction for critical steps. No signs of malware, data leaks, or sabotage found.",
