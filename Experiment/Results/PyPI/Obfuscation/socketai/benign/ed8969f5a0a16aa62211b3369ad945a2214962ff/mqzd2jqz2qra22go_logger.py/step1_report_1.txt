  "purpose": "Configure logging with a custom formatter and stream handler in Python",
  "sources": "Logging initialization, reading module name (__name__)",
  "sinks": "Logging output to stdout via StreamHandler",
  "flows": "Logging configuration sources (__name__) -> Formatter -> StreamHandler -> Logger",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, no sensitive data or code execution, no suspicious external calls",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a logger with a custom formatter and a stream handler, both of which are standard practices for logging in Python. Variable names are obfuscated, but there are no signs of malicious code, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No input or untrusted data is processed, and no suspicious behaviors are present. The code appears to be benign configuration code intended for logging purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard logging setup with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated variable names, which could hinder readability but do not imply malicious intent.",
