  "flows": "Logger setup -> Handler configuration -> Formatter application.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, which hinder readability but are not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard logging configuration in Python, with obfuscated variable names. No external data inputs, network activity, or code execution are present. The obfuscation is likely for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The code performs benign setup tasks, and there are no suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, malicious network connections, or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard logging setup with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The high obfuscation score reflects variable name obscurity but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the analysis.",
