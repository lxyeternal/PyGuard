  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a misconfigured or intentionally obfuscated setup file with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and unusual parameter usage are suspicious but not conclusive of malware. The package should be reviewed for correctness and clarity, and the obfuscated parameter should be corrected to standard arguments."
