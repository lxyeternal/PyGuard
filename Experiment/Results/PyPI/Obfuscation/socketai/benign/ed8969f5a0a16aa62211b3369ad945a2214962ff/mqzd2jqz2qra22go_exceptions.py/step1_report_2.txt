  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named HtWCfFyPvkEBpipqLKfyIdICVuhFTVAI",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources used in this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code only defines a class and does not process data",
  "flows": "No data flow as the class is only a definition without usage",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated and nonsensical, which can be suspicious. No meaningful variable or class names are used.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single exception class inheriting from Exception. The class name is a long, nonsensical string, possibly obfuscated or generated. The constructor simply calls the superclass constructor with provided arguments. There are no external data reads, no malicious functions, or suspicious behavior observed. The obfuscated class name might be an attempt to hide intent, but without further code, it is just an unusual naming choice.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines an obfuscated custom exception class without any malicious behavior or external data handling. The unusual class name is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No evidence of malware or security risks detected.",
