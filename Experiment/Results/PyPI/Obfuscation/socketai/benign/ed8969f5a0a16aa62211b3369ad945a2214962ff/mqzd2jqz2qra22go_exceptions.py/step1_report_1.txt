  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named HtWCfFyPvkEBpipqLKfyIdICVuhFTVAI.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input readings present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines a class and a constructor.",
  "anomalies": "Class name is an obfuscated, nonsensical string; no meaningful or descriptive identifier.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name inheriting from Exception. The constructor forwards a message and additional arguments to the base class. There are no external data sources, no untrusted inputs, no outputs, or side effects. The class name appears deliberately obfuscated, which could be a sign of malicious intent or an attempt to hide functionality, but on its own, it does not perform any malicious action. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risk evident from this snippet alone. The obfuscated class name could be suspicious, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
