  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for error handling.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within the code.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be obfuscated or randomly generated; no meaningful naming.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class in Python, inheriting from Exception. It includes an __init__ method that calls the superclass initializer with a message and additional arguments. There are no signs of malicious behavior, suspicious data handling, or obfuscation beyond the naming. The class itself performs no actions other than defining a specialized exception.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless custom exception class with an unusual name that appears to be obfuscated or randomly generated. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
