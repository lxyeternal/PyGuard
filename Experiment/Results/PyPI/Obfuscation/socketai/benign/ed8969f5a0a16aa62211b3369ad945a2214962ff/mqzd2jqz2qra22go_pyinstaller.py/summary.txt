  "conclusion": "The code functions as a build utility for packaging Python applications, with input validation and logging. While obfuscation and dynamic command assembly introduce potential security risks, no evidence of malicious activity is present. The main concern is reliance on external validation functions; if these are weak, command injection could occur. The malware score is low, and the security risk is moderate, primarily due to command construction methods. Overall, the code appears legitimate but warrants caution regarding validation robustness."
