  "sinks": "Logger's critical method, which outputs log messages",
  "flows": "Calling the decorated function triggers a call to OuaEmkatxXxByHOxjqQZYhlYmGdSQCYr.critical",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; no clear malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a logger object and defines a decorator that logs a deprecation warning whenever the decorated function is invoked. The logger method used is 'critical', which suggests logging at a high severity level. The variable and function names appear intentionally obfuscated, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code functions as a standard deprecation warning mechanism with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate deprecation logger implemented with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
