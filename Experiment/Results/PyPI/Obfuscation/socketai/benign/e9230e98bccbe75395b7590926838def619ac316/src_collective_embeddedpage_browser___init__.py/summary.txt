  "malware_score": 0.65,
  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious indicators, except for reports highlighting dynamic execution and obfuscation, which suggest potential malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. The overall security risk is low to moderate, with high suspicion only in cases involving eval()/exec() and obfuscation."
