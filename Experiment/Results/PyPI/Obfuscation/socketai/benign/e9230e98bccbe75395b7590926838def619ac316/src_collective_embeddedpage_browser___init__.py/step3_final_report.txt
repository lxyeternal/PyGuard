  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input reading functions, environment variables, network connections, dynamic execution functions like eval() or exec(), file I/O, external domain requests.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writing, environment variable access, dynamic code execution, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input flow into dynamic execution or network transmission points, potentially leading to data exfiltration or malicious control.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted input, obfuscated code segments, external domain connections, hardcoded secrets, unusual variable naming, or code structure that suggests hiding malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits no suspicious activity if it contains straightforward data handling, no dynamic execution, and no external communication. Presence of eval()/exec() and obfuscation are strong indicators of malicious intent, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Missing or incomplete code prevents conclusive analysis, warranting low confidence. Overall, benign code with no suspicious patterns warrants low scores, while code with dynamic execution and obfuscation warrants higher scores. The source-to-sink flow analysis confirms that untrusted inputs could lead to data leaks or malicious control if present. The code's structure and behavior determine the final risk assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no malicious indicators, except for reports highlighting dynamic execution and obfuscation, which suggest potential malicious behavior. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors. The overall security risk is low to moderate, with high suspicion only in cases involving eval()/exec() and obfuscation.",
