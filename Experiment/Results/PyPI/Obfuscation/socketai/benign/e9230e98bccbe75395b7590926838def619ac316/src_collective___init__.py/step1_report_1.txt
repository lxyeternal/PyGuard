  "purpose": "Declare the current package namespace as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is used or passed to sinks in this code.",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and then declares the namespace; there are no data flows involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing a standard library component and declaring a namespace. No unusual or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which is a standard way to declare a namespace package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is very minimal, focusing solely on namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet performs a standard namespace declaration and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate package setup code.",
