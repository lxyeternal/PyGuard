  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package using pkg_resources' declare_namespace method.",
  "sources": "Import of pkg_resources module and call to declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources → declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkg_resources and declares a namespace with __name__, a common pattern in Python packaging. It does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or execute dynamic code. The code is clear, not obfuscated, and contains no secrets or malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0) are appropriate given its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard, benign namespace declaration snippet with no malicious intent or security issues. The scores are justified; malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.",
