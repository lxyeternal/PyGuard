  "purpose": "Declare the current namespace as a package namespace using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and calls 'declare_namespace' with '__name__' as argument.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "The import leads to namespace declaration but no data flow to other parts or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for namespace declaration; no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and declares a namespace for the current package/module. This is a common pattern for namespace packages to avoid name conflicts. No data input, output, or external interactions are present. The code is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply declares a namespace for a Python package using a standard library method. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
