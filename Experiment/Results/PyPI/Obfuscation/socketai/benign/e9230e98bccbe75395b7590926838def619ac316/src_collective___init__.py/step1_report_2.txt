  "purpose": "Declare the current package namespace using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkg_resources' module, specifically the declare_namespace function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs. The use of declare_namespace is standard for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pkg_resources' and calls 'declare_namespace(__name__)', which is a common pattern for setting up namespace packages in Python. It does not read external data, execute untrusted code, or perform any suspicious actions. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code is minimal and standard for namespace package declarations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward namespace declaration for a Python package, with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
