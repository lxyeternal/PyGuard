  "purpose": "Declare the current package as a namespace package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data or potential security impact.",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkg_resources' leads to calling 'declare_namespace' with __name__, establishing namespace package behavior.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; this is a common pattern for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkg_resources' module and declares the current package as a namespace package via 'declare_namespace(__name__)'. This is a standard method used in Python to support namespace packages, especially for large, modular projects. There are no hardcoded secrets, malicious behaviors, or suspicious activities detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, serving a structural purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace package declaration with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It is typical boilerplate code for namespace packages.",
