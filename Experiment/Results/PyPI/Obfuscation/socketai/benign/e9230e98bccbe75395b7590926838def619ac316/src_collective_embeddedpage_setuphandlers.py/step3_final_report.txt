  "purpose": "Defines a non-installable component class implementing an interface, with functions assigning static strings to local variables, serving as configuration or marker code.",
  "sources": "Class method returning a list; functions assigning static strings to local variables.",
  "sinks": "No external input, data processing, or data transmission points present.",
  "flows": "Class method and functions operate independently, with no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names; functions contain only static string assignments with no further logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, serving as configuration or marker code within a Plone/Zope environment. No external inputs, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscated names suggest concealment but do not imply malicious intent. The functions do not process or transmit data, and the class only returns a static list. The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious behavior. The security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), justified by obfuscation but no active threats. The obfuscation score (~0.7) reflects superficial name obfuscation without malicious purpose. Overall, the code appears benign, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration or placeholder code with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity, data leaks, or external communications are detected. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are appropriate. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent.",
