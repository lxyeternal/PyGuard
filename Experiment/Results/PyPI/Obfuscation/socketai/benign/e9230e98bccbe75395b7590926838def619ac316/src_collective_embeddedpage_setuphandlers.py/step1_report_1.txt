{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class implementing an interface for non-installable product components and includes two functions that assign strings to local variables.",
  "sources": "The functions assign static strings to local variables, but do not read external input or untrusted data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows leading to data leaks, system modifications, or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; functions do not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and function names, which could be an attempt to hide intent. No actual malicious behavior, such as network activity or data exfiltration, is observed.",
  "analysis": "The class implements an interface likely related to package installation behavior, which is legitimate in certain contexts. The functions define local variables with static string values but do nothing with them. There are no input reads, external calls, or suspicious logic. The obfuscated names might suggest an attempt at concealment, but the code itself performs no harmful actions or security-sensitive operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving primarily as a structural or obfuscated placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
