  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Import of MessageFactory -> assignment to _ variable.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import and assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard internationalization utility and assigns it to a variable, a common pattern in Zope/Plone. It contains no dynamic code, user input, network activity, or obfuscated constructs. All signals indicate benign, boilerplate setup for message translation with no security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard internationalization setup with no malicious or security concerns. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scores are appropriate.",
