  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads metadata files and defines dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads README.rst, CONTRIBUTORS.rst, CHANGES.rst files; environment check via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external commands or network activity.",
  "flows": "File reading flows into setup configuration; environment check influences execution flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'frYkNNmnfqboydJCvCUzZZwTAcvarezD'), inconsistent formatting, missing closing parenthesis in 'assert' statement.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious. The environment check ensures Python version compatibility. The file reads metadata files to assemble package info. The syntax error in 'assert' could cause runtime failure but is not malicious. No external or malicious code is present. The obfuscation may be stylistic or an attempt to hide intent but does not indicate malicious activity. The overall structure is standard, with superficial obfuscation and a minor syntax issue.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with superficial obfuscation and a syntax error. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack. The obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring but does not justify a malware or high security risk score.",
