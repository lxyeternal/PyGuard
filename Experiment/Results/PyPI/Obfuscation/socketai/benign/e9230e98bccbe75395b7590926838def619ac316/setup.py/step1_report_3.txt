  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and configuration.",
  "sources": "Input reading from 'README.rst', 'CONTRIBUTORS.rst', and 'CHANGES.rst' files; environment check via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing, network calls, or external command execution present.",
  "flows": "Read files for long description, perform environment check, and define package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical (e.g., 'frYkNNmnfqboydJCvCUzZZwTAcvarezD', 'kdlsKiguNpwGUzuuAHDoCIvOctkIKovN'), which is unusual and suggests obfuscation or scrambling. The code does not include any malicious logic, but variable naming is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a basic environment check for Python version and reads several documentation files for the package description. The setup() function is called with typical metadata and dependency lists. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not themselves indicate malicious intent. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The code appears to be standard for a Python package setup, aside from variable name obfuscation, which might be accidental or stylistic.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No malware, security risks, or anomalies are apparent beyond the obfuscation.",
