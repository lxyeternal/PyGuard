  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with obfuscation and dynamic features that could be exploited if misused. No explicit malware is present, but the potential for misuse warrants caution. Proper input validation and sanitization are recommended to mitigate risks associated with dynamic imports and reflection."
