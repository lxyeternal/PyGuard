  "purpose": "Utility functions for parsing, handling reStructuredText nodes, dynamic imports, class/module resolution, and documentation utilities.",
  "sources": "Parameters, environment objects, imported modules, environment data, class/module names, node inputs.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import statements, getattr attribute access, reflection, class resolution, environment data access.",
  "flows": "Inputs from parameters/environment flow into import_module, getattr, class resolution functions, potentially leading to dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, incomplete or undefined references (e.g., oxByHGHEmClhVYLNtRLSEOJisDsMWIbi), heavily obfuscated code structure, minimal validation, dynamic features without explicit sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions primarily for documentation and introspection, heavily relying on dynamic import and reflection. Obfuscation and dynamic features pose potential security risks if inputs are untrusted, but no active malicious activity such as network calls, file modifications, or data exfiltration is evident. The high obfuscation level and dynamic code patterns justify cautious scoring. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.2, risk 0.2-0.45, obfuscation high) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with obfuscation and dynamic features that could be exploited if misused. No explicit malware is present, but the potential for misuse warrants caution. Proper input validation and sanitization are recommended to mitigate risks associated with dynamic imports and reflection.",
