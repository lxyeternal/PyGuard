  "purpose": "Defines custom reStructuredText nodes for rendering HTML <details> and <summary> elements in a document.",
  "sources": "Initial class definitions, method parameters, and node attribute accesses.",
  "sinks": "Appending to visitor.body with formatted HTML strings.",
  "flows": "Node attribute values are used to generate HTML tags and appended to visitor.body.",
  "anomalies": "Code is obfuscated with non-descriptive, randomly generated class and method names. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected. No network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two node classes for a documentation system, translating custom nodes into HTML <details> and <summary> tags. The methods use class attributes and node properties to generate HTML snippets, which are appended to a visitor object’s body. The code structure is convoluted and obfuscated but functionally straightforward. No suspicious logic, external data sources, or potential malicious behavior found. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could hide malicious intent, but based solely on the code content, it appears to be benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated but appears to serve a legitimate purpose of rendering specific HTML elements within a documentation system. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks detected.",
