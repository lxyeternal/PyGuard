  "purpose": "Define custom nodes for a documentation processing application, likely to render HTML details and summary tags.",
  "sources": "Class constructors and methods that initialize node attributes and append HTML strings to visitor bodies.",
  "sinks": "Appending raw HTML strings such as <details>, <summary>, and their closing tags to visitor.body.",
  "flows": "Methods that generate HTML tags and append them to visitor.body, based on node attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data manipulation. The code dynamically generates HTML but does not execute external code or handle untrusted input explicitly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom node classes for rendering <details> and <summary> HTML elements, used in a document processing context. These classes include methods that append HTML strings directly to a visitor object, depending on node attributes like 'open' and 'classes'. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code appears to be a standard implementation of custom nodes for a documentation framework, with no obfuscated code, suspicious data handling, or backdoors. The HTML generation is static and controlled, with no external inputs influencing the output in a malicious way.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of custom nodes for a documentation processing tool, intended to render <details> and <summary> HTML tags. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and purposeful for customizing document rendering.",
