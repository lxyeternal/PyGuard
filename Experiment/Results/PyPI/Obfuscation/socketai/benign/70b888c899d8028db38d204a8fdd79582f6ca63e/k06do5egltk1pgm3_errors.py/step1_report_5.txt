{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling, likely for use in a larger program.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance declarations; no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, no data handling or output, no external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as these are simply class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names, but no malicious code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated names. Both classes inherit from Python's built-in Exception class, with the second inheriting from the first. There is no functional code, no data input, no external communication, and no suspicious logic. The obfuscated names could be an attempt to conceal intent, but given the simplicity and context, they appear to be harmless custom exception definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a means to define custom exception types, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated class names are likely for code obfuscation or to avoid easy identification, but do not indicate malicious intent.",
