  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names that resemble random strings; no other unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of two class definitions, both inheriting from built-in Exception classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated class names. There are no input operations, data processing, or network interactions. The purpose appears to be defining custom exception types, possibly to obfuscate error handling or for code concealment. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident. The obfuscated names could be intended to evade straightforward detection, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simply defining two custom exception classes with obfuscated names, without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve a purpose related to exception handling but does not pose a security threat.",
