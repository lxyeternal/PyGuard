{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated, non-descriptive names, likely for use as placeholders or in larger codebases.",
  "sources": "Class definitions reading no external input or data; no data flow, input/output, or external interactions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow from sources to sinks; classes are inert.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, which could be superficial or for concealment, but no malicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with obfuscated names. No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The obfuscation of class names is noted but does not imply malicious intent. Malware scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Security risk scores are low (~0.1), appropriate given the benign nature. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.75), consistent with class names. The analysis across reports is consistent and justified, with no evidence of malicious behavior or active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as placeholder or custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no malicious activity or security risk. The scores and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code snippet.",
