  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No data input, external input, or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external data transmission, or external effect is present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of intentionally obfuscated class names; no meaningful identifiers; minimal code structure; no real logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception classes with obscure, non-descriptive names. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The class names appear to be intentionally obscured, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply to evade detection. However, without any executable logic, data handling, or external communication, it is unlikely that this code itself is malicious. The obfuscation may be suspicious but does not confirm malicious behavior by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines two custom exceptions with obscure names and contains no executable or malicious logic. It appears to be either placeholder code or deliberately obfuscated to hide intent. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet.",
