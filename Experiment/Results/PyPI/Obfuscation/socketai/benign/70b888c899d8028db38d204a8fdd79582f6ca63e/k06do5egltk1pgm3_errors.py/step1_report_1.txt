  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs read by the code",
  "sinks": "No output or data sinks; exception classes are not used for data leakage or system effects",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are only definitions",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names that resemble random strings, which is unusual but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated, non-descriptive class names. There are no function calls, data processing, input/output operations, or suspicious behaviors present. The obfuscated names could be an attempt to hide purpose but do not constitute malicious behavior on their own. No external data, environment variables, or system interactions are present. The code appears to serve the purpose of custom exception handling, possibly as part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign class definition for custom exceptions with obfuscated names. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
