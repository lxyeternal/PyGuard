  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling or specific error categorization",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink, as the code only defines classes",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, seemingly random class names; no functional code or logic present",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from each other. There are no functions, data processing, or data input/output operations. The classes are merely placeholders for exceptions, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt to hide their purpose, but they do not perform any malicious actions by themselves. The absence of executable code, data handling, or network activity suggests a benign intent, albeit with possible obfuscation of purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated names and no operational logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscation appears superficial, with no evidence of malicious activity.",
