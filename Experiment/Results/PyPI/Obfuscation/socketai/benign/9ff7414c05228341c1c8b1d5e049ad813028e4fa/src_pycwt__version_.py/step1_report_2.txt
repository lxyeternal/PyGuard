    "Assignment of string to variable, then assigning the same value to another variable.",
    "Assignment of tuple to a variable."
  ],
  "anomalies": "Variables named with seemingly random strings; no meaningful or suspicious naming. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to initialize variables with version data, possibly for package management. Variable names are obfuscated but do not contain malicious patterns. There are no data flows involving untrusted sources, no sinks indicating data leakage or harmful actions. The code is straightforward and limited to simple assignments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as version assignment or metadata storage without any malicious intent or security risks.",
