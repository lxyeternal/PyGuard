{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a Python module related to continuous wavelet transforms (CWT), importing specific functions and constants from the pycwt package and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '__future__' for compatibility; import from 'pycwt._version_' which likely contains version info or internal constants; import from 'pycwt.wavelet' module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or external output with potential security implications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident; the code only performs imports and module setup.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking identifiers ('naZXNbJFcUfnutREVQGILApvrBISPLgc', 'LhljPnkabwByiOlrebcADbnWrUQYRjTv') imported from internal module, which may indicate obfuscation or hidden data; no actual malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future features for compatibility, then imports specific identifiers from an internal module within 'pycwt', notably with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. It also imports all symbols from 'pycwt.wavelet' and defines a list of symbols to export. There are no indications of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The obfuscated identifiers may suggest concealment but are likely internal constants or version info. Overall, the code appears to serve module initialization purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for a wavelet transform package, with some obfuscated import names that may be internal constants or version information. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or supply chain attacks.",
