  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Summary of individual reports:**\n\n- **Reports 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:**  \n  All identify the core issue: the import from `'pycwt._version_'` includes obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers such as `'naZXNbJFcUfnutREVQGILApvrBISPLgc'` and `'LhljPnkabwByiOlrebcADbnWrUQYRjTv'`. These identifiers do not follow standard naming conventions and are suspicious.\n\n- **Common points:**  \n  - No evidence of malicious behavior like network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.  \n  - The code is primarily setup and import statements for a wavelet analysis package.  \n  - The obfuscated identifiers could be internal constants, version info, or placeholders, but their obscurity raises concern.\n\n- **Differences in confidence levels:**  \n  - Reports 1 and 3 have high confidence (0.8 and 0.9) that the obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but no malware is confirmed.  \n  - Reports 4 and 5 are slightly less confident but still note the obfuscation as unusual.  \n  - Report 2 is more cautious, assigning a lower obfuscation score and confidence.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The import of `'pycwt._version_'` with obfuscated identifiers is suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n- No evidence of active malicious behavior in this code snippet.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No clear mistakes in reasoning; all reports correctly identify the obfuscation concern.\n- The conclusion that there's no malicious activity is reasonable given the code.\n\n### Scores and their justification:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscation alone does not confirm malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.5 to 0.7, which seems reasonable considering the identifiers are cryptic but could be internal constants.\n\n- **Risk score:**  \n  Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting low but non-zero concern due to obfuscation.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The obfuscation in the import statements is the main concern.  \n- The code itself appears benign, serving as a module setup.  \n- The obfuscated identifiers could be internal constants, version info, or placeholders, but they could also be hiding malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- Verify the `'pycwt._version_'` module to see what these identifiers represent.  \n- If these are internal constants or version info, the obfuscation might be benign.  \n- If these identifiers are part of a malicious payload or hidden behavior, further analysis of the `'pycwt._version_'` module is necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.6 (cryptic identifiers, but could be internal constants)  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low risk, primarily due to obfuscation concern)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code's core functionality appears benign, but the obfuscated import identifiers warrant further investigation. No active malicious behavior is evident, but the obfuscation should be verified to rule out hidden malicious intent.",
