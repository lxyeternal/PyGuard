{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports specific functions and constants from the 'pycwt' library, likely for continuous wavelet transform operations and related analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports from '__future__' for compatibility; imports from 'pycwt._version_' and 'pycwt.wavelet' modules, including specific attributes and functions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; the code only imports modules and defines '__all__' and '__name__' variables.",
  "flows": "The code imports external modules and assigns '__name__'; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute names from 'pycwt._version_' are obfuscated and appear as random strings, which is unusual and suspicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and setting module metadata. The import of obfuscated attribute names from '_version_' suggests potential malicious obfuscation or hidden behavior. The rest of the code is standard for defining a module's public API. No indications of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The obfuscated attribute names warrant further investigation, but on their own, they may be legitimate versioning identifiers or internal constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code mainly performs standard imports and module setup. The obfuscated attribute names are unusual but not necessarily malicious without further context. There are no direct signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
