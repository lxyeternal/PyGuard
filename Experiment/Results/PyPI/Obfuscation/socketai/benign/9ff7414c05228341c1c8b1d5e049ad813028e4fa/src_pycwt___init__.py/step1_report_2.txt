{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package related to continuous wavelet transforms (CWT), defining exports for the package's API.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the imported modules '__future__', 'pycwt._version_', and 'pycwt.wavelet'. It does not include user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or harmful effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observable; the code primarily sets up module imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "The imported module '__future__' is used for compatibility; however, the import from 'pycwt._version_' involves obfuscated-looking identifiers ('naZXNbJFcUfnutREVQGILApvrBISPLgc', 'LhljPnkabwByiOlrebcADbnWrUQYRjTv'), which are unusual and potentially suspicious. These identifiers do not follow standard naming conventions and could be indicative of obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly structural, setting up imports and __all__ exports. The use of '__future__' imports is standard for compatibility. The key concern is the import from 'pycwt._version_' with cryptic identifiers, which may suggest obfuscation or concealed functionality. There are no apparent malicious actions, such as network operations or data manipulation, present in this snippet. Given the context, the obfuscated identifiers warrant caution, but without further code, there is no definitive malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code serves as a module setup for a wavelet transform library. The main concern is the obfuscated import identifiers, which could conceal malicious code or unwanted behavior. However, the code itself does not exhibit overt malicious activity. Further review of the actual 'pycwt._version_' module would be necessary to determine if there is malicious intent.",
