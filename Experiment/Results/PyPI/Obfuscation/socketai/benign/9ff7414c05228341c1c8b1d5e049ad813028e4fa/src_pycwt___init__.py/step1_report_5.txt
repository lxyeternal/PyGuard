{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a Python module for continuous wavelet transform (CWT) operations, importing functions and constants from a library and defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from '__future__' and 'pycwt._version_' and 'pycwt.wavelet' modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leakage or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly imports and defines exports.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers 'naZXNbJFcUfnutREVQGILApvrBISPLgc' and 'LhljPnkabwByiOlrebcADbnWrUQYRjTv' are cryptic, non-descriptive, and appear to be random strings or obfuscated names. Their purpose is unclear and could indicate obfuscation or hidden intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard future features for compatibility and imports specific constants and functions from the 'pycwt' library. The presence of cryptic identifiers from 'pycwt._version_' is unusual; these could be obfuscated or auto-generated, raising suspicion about hidden or malicious intent. The rest of the code defines a list of public symbols, which is typical for a module setup. There is no active code execution, data handling, or network operations that could be malicious. The cryptic import names are the primary anomaly, but without further context, they could be benign obfuscated internal identifiers or maliciously hidden elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily sets up a module for wavelet transforms, with one notable anomaly being the cryptic, non-descriptive imported identifiers. These could be obfuscation or internal identifiers but also could hint at malicious intent or concealed functionality. Based solely on this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obscure import names warrant further investigation.",
