  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Content and Purpose**:\n   - The code primarily performs module setup: importing future compatibility features, importing version info and wavelet functions, and defining the public API via `__all__`.\n   - The `__version__` import from `pycwt._version_` uses obfuscated-looking identifiers, which is unusual.\n\n2. **Presence of Obfuscated Identifiers**:\n   - All reports note that the imported names from `pycwt._version_` are cryptic, non-descriptive, and do not follow standard naming conventions.\n   - These could be:\n     - Internal constants or version info, possibly auto-generated or obfuscated.\n     - Placeholder or dummy names.\n     - An attempt to hide malicious code or functionality.\n\n3. **Malicious Behavior and Data Flows**:\n   - No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n   - No untrusted data sources or sinks are present.\n   - The code is mainly import and setup, with no active execution or data processing.\n\n4. **Analysis of Obfuscation and Risks**:\n   - The obfuscated names are suspicious but not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n   - They could be internal constants or version identifiers intentionally obfuscated.\n   - The absence of malicious code, network activity, or data handling suggests low risk.\n\n5. **Scores and Justifications**:\n   - **Malware Score**:\n     - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n   - **Obfuscated Score**:\n     - Ranges from 0.5 to 0.7; this seems reasonable given the obfuscated identifiers.\n   - **Risk Score**:\n     - Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3; given the lack of malicious activity but presence of obfuscation, this is appropriate.\n\n6. **Potential Discrepancies**:\n   - The reports are consistent in their assessment that there's no direct malicious activity.\n   - The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could be benign or malicious.\n\n7. **Final Assessment**:\n   - Based on the code snippet, the obfuscated identifiers are the main anomaly.\n   - There is no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain attack.\n   - The obfuscation could be internal or auto-generated, not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware Score**: **0.0**  \n  No signs of malicious behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated Score**: **0.6**  \n  The obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but not conclusively malicious.\n\n- **Risk Score**: **0.2**  \n  Slight concern due to obfuscation, but overall low risk.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code appears to be a standard module setup with obfuscated internal identifiers, which warrants further review of the actual `pycwt._version_` module. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation is a point of concern but not definitive.\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- Verify the contents of `pycwt._version_` to confirm whether the obfuscated names are legitimate internal constants or potentially malicious.\n- Ensure the package source is trusted and maintained by reputable authors.\n- Consider static or dynamic analysis of the full package if further suspicion arises.\n\n**Final verdict**: The risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring.",
