  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Key observations across all reports:**\n- All reports note the presence of obfuscated or cryptic identifiers imported from `pycwt._version_`, such as `'naZXNbJFcUfnutREVQGILApvrBISPLgc'` and `'LhljPnkabwByiOlrebcADbnWrUQYRjTv'`.\n- The code primarily performs module setup: imports, defining `__all__`, and setting `__name__`.\n- No network activity, data exfiltration, or direct malicious actions are evident.\n- The obfuscated identifiers could be internal constants, version info, or placeholders, but their non-standard naming raises suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but do not, on their own, demonstrate malicious behavior.\n- No evidence of malicious code, malware, or supply chain compromise is present in these snippets.\n- The code appears to be standard module setup for a wavelet analysis package, with the caveat of obfuscated import names.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The main concern is the obfuscated import names. If these are placeholders or internal constants, they are benign; if they are maliciously inserted, they could conceal malicious behavior.\n- The inconsistent naming conventions and cryptic identifiers are unusual and should be verified.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.5 to 0.7, which seems reasonable given the obfuscated identifiers.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly low (0.2), which seems appropriate unless further malicious activity is uncovered.\n\n### Justification for higher scores:\n- Since the obfuscated identifiers could potentially hide malicious code, a cautious approach would be to assign a slightly higher security risk score if further investigation suggests concealment of malicious logic.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is justified unless malicious code is found.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity is evident, but obfuscation warrants caution.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** **0** (no evidence of malicious behavior)  \n**Obfuscated score:** **0.6** (moderately suspicious, warrants further review)  \n**Risk score:** **0.3** (low, but with some concern due to obfuscation)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is primarily a standard module setup with suspicious obfuscated import identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. However, the obfuscated identifiers should be verified to confirm they are benign internal constants or version info. Overall, the risk is low but warrants further internal review of the `_version_` module.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n- Verify the contents of `pycwt._version_` to ensure these identifiers are legitimate.\n- Confirm whether these obfuscated names are auto-generated, placeholders, or maliciously inserted.\n- Continue monitoring for any unusual behavior in the package.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6\n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\nThis balanced approach reflects the current evidence and the need for further verification of the obfuscated identifiers.",
