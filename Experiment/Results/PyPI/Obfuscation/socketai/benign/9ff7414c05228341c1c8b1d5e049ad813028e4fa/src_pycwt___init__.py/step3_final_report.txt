{
  "purpose": "The code initializes the pycwt package by importing version info and wavelet functions, setting up exports, and defining module identity.",
  "sources": "Import from 'pycwt._version_' which provides obfuscated identifiers; no external data sources or inputs are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows are evident; the code only performs static imports and definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static setup with internal imports.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated identifiers imported from 'pycwt._version_' such as 'naZXNbJFcUfnutREVQGILApvrBISPLgc' and 'LhljPnkabwByiOlrebcADbnWrUQYRjTv' are suspicious due to their nonsensical naming, indicating potential obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily module setup with imports and export definitions. The obfuscated identifiers are unusual and warrant verification but do not demonstrate malicious behavior. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation may be internal constants or version info, but their cryptic nature raises suspicion. The malware score is zero, reflecting no active malicious intent. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), indicating suspicion but not confirmed maliciousness. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to the obfuscation concern. Further investigation of 'pycwt._version_' is recommended to confirm the purpose of these identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a setup module for the pycwt package. The only concern is the obfuscated import identifiers, which should be verified to ensure they are internal constants or version info rather than malicious code. No active malicious behavior or supply chain compromise is evident.",
