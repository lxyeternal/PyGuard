  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or execute external data or inputs.",
  "flows": "The code simply imports and calls 'setup()', with no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, consisting solely of an import and a single function call; no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and executes the 'setup()' function, which is standard for Python package configuration. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. The minimal structure suggests this is a typical setup script for packaging, with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward Python packaging setup script with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
