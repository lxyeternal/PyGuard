  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for a Python package using setuptools",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools module",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow; setup() invoked without parameters",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it with no arguments, which is standard for minimal package setup scripts. There are no external data sources, sinks, or data flows. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate given the simplicity and lack of suspicious elements. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign minimal setup script with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The reports are accurate, and the scores are justified. No further action or concern is necessary.",
