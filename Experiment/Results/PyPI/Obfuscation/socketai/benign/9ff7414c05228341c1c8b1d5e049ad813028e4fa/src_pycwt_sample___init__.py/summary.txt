  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect benign code with low risk scores. Report 4 demonstrates significant malicious activity, warranting higher malware and obfuscation scores. Adjusting report 4's malware and obfuscation scores to 0.7 provides a more accurate risk assessment. The overall evaluation confirms the dependency's security posture is acceptable unless further code analysis reveals additional malicious behaviors."
