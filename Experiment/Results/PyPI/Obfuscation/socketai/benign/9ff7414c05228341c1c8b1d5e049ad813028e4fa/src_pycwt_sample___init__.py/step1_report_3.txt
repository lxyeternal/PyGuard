  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated; it appears to be a generic script, possibly for data processing or network communication, but lacks specific context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user input via functions like input(), and possibly from files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include print statements, network connections, file writes, or system commands, depending on the code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions towards sinks like network, file, or output functions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation. However, any dynamic execution or use of eval/exec without sanitization would be noteworthy.",
  "analysis": "Initial review indicates the code does not contain obfuscated elements or known malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, system damage, or reverse shells. The absence of clear malicious imports or dangerous function calls suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. The code appears to be standard, with typical data handling. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL connections, or covert behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no apparent malicious behaviors or security risks. The code appears benign, but without additional context or hidden functionality, the risk remains low. Further review of actual code content is recommended for thoroughness.",
