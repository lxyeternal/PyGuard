  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a utility or sample script, possibly for handling data or performing basic operations. Without further context, its primary function is not explicitly clear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables and possibly from user inputs or function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or printing to console, depending on the code's content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs towards sinks like network or file systems, passing through processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear control flow. It uses standard libraries and functions. There are no signs of malicious intent, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or secret handling. The absence of suspicious domain connections or encrypted payloads further reduces concern.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
