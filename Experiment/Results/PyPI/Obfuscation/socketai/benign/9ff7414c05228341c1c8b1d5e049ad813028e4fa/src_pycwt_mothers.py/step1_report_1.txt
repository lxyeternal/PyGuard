  "purpose": "Define wavelet functions and related mathematical operations for signal analysis, specifically Morlet, Paul, DOG, and Mexican Hat wavelets.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, numpy, scipy.signal, scipy.special, and local helpers; class initializers and methods that compute wavelet functions and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform network I/O, database access, or file manipulation.",
  "flows": "Class methods compute mathematical functions and parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly internal calculations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and code with unusual, complex structure. The code appears intentionally convoluted, but no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines several classes representing different wavelet functions, including Morlet, Paul, DOG, and Mexican Hat. Each class computes specific parameters and functions relevant to wavelet analysis. Variable names are deliberately obscure, likely to hinder easy understanding. There is no evidence of data leaks, network activity, or code that executes malicious actions. The functions perform mathematical calculations consistent with wavelet theory, with no suspicious I/O or behavior. The imports and helper functions are used for mathematical and signal processing purposes only. No suspicious patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, network communication, or system manipulation, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a mathematical library for wavelet analysis with intentionally obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The complexity seems designed to obscure intent but does not suggest malicious intent. No malware or security risks are detected based on this analysis.",
