{
  "purpose": "The code defines several wavelet functions for signal processing, including Morlet, Paul, DOG, and Mexican Hat wavelets, with associated parameter calculations and convolutions.",
  "sources": "Data inputs include function parameters, class attributes, and possibly untrusted inputs for computations. The code reads 'f' (frequency), and various class attributes are set during initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the convolution operations and Fourier transforms, which could process untrusted data. However, no network, file, or environment variable access is observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and class attributes flow into wavelet functions, which generate wavelet kernels and apply convolutions to input data. The data flow is typical for signal processing tasks.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated-like variable names and uses seemingly arbitrary constants and class attributes (e.g., 'dfbqkrFovWiyjQGAocAnEYzBYFYQzjzC') which suggest code obfuscation. No clear malicious logic, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications, is present. The presence of complex mathematical functions appears consistent with signal processing.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements wavelet functions for signal analysis. It involves mathematical operations, Fourier transforms, and convolutions. The obfuscated variable names and constants suggest intentional code concealment but do not directly indicate malicious intent. No network or system calls, file operations, or environment variable accesses are detected. The functions do not perform suspicious actions like data theft, code injection, or remote control. The overall structure aligns with standard scientific computing for wavelet transforms.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of wavelet functions for signal processing with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this module. The obfuscation might be to hinder reverse engineering but does not indicate malware. Overall security risk is low.",
