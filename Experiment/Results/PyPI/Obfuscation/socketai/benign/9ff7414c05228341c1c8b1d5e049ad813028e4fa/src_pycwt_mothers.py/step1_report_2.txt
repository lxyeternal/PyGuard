{
  "purpose": "This code defines several wavelet functions (Morlet, Paul, DOG, Mexican Hat) likely for signal processing or analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly read; the code includes functions accepting input parameters, such as 'f' and 'yrJjYyYuBspgobEMymXGfbneNMeXgzBh', which are method parameters, and some class attributes set during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; no network communication, file I/O, or sensitive data access is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve mathematical calculations within methods, transforming inputs into wavelet functions; no external untrusted data flow is detected.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and imports from a local helpers module; use of unusual variable names (e.g., 'UuPUpsRryXyYeMSefxUjcSvGWDZviyTy') and constants suggest intentional obfuscation or concealment. Several functions assign class attributes based on parameters with inconsistent or placeholder values. The method 'ospMMITXYrDXCmYZSrDkqEIYkrIsqDcC' references a variable 'dfbqkrFovWiyjQGAocAnEYzBYFYQzjzC' which is not defined in the provided code, indicating incomplete or dynamically assigned code. No explicit malicious code or backdoors are evident; however, the obfuscated and inconsistent variable usage is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to define wavelet functions with complex mathematical expressions, some involving special functions and orthogonal polynomials. The obfuscated variable names and the presence of undefined variables (e.g., 'dfbqkrFovWiyjQGAocAnEYzBYFYQzjzC') suggest possible intentional obfuscation. No network operations, file handling, or direct data leaks are implemented. The lack of clear input validation, combined with highly obfuscated naming, indicates potential concealment of malicious intent, but no concrete malicious actions are observable. The code structure aligns with signal processing modules, but the obfuscation raises suspicion about potential hidden behaviors not directly observable here.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily defines wavelet functions with obfuscated variable names and some incomplete references. There is no explicit malicious behavior detected, but the obfuscation and inconsistent code elements suggest it could be part of a larger, possibly concealed, malicious module. Without additional context or the helper module, the overall risk remains uncertain but leans toward caution due to obfuscation.",
