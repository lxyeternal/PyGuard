{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for wavelet functions (Morlet, Paul, DOG, Mexican Hat) used in signal processing and analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters such as frequency values, class attributes, and external helper functions for mathematical computations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows are present; calculations are performed internally within the module.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through mathematical functions and convolutions, with data flowing from class attributes and helper functions to output arrays representing wavelet transforms.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in variable names (e.g., 'UuPUpsRryXyYeMSefxUjcSvGWDZviyTy'), use of placeholder-like constants (e.g., 'dfbqkrFovWiyjQGAocAnEYzBYFYQzjzC'), and references to undefined variables suggest intentional obfuscation or incomplete code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code implements mathematical wavelet functions with complex, obfuscated variable names, likely to hinder reverse engineering. It performs internal calculations without external data or network activity. The presence of undefined variables and complex structures indicates obfuscation but not necessarily malicious intent. Multiple independent reviews confirm the absence of malicious behavior, with high confidence. The obfuscation is consistent with deliberate concealment rather than sabotage. No signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious system interactions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a sophisticated, obfuscated implementation of wavelet analysis functions for signal processing. Despite high obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal implementation details but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, with a very low malware likelihood.",
