{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for various wavelet functions, including Morlet, Paul, DOG, and Mexican Hat, primarily for signal processing or analysis tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters for wavelet functions, uses mathematical functions from numpy, scipy, and local helper functions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class methods, which perform mathematical calculations and convolutions. No data flows into external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class and variable names; some calculations involve constants and parameters without clear context. The code contains complex, seemingly unnecessary polynomial evaluations and convolutions, but no clear malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. The code structure suggests signal processing rather than malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes implementing wavelet functions, likely for signal analysis. The methods perform mathematical computations involving scipy and numpy, with some convolutions and polynomial evaluations. There are no network communications, data exfiltration, or system modification activities. The variable naming is obfuscated but consistent with mathematical signal processing routines. No suspicious code injections or external data dependencies are evident. The presence of complex mathematical operations appears to be for signal transformation purposes rather than malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for scientific or analytical tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This source code contains classes for wavelet functions used in signal processing. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code appears intentionally obfuscated in variable naming but is consistent with legitimate mathematical computations. No malicious or supply chain sabotage activities are detected.",
