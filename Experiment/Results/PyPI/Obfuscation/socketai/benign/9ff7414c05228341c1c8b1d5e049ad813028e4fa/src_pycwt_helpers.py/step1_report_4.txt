{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for signal processing, including FFT setup, AR model estimation, window functions, and cache directory management.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., user home directory), input data for signal processing functions, and system imports for FFT and multiprocessing.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to cache directory; no other untrusted data sinks identified. No data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables → Directory creation → Input data → Signal processing functions; no network or system command flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic import fallback logic, and complex mathematical functions that obscure intent. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up FFT interfaces with fallbacks, processes signals for AR model parameters, generates window functions, and manages cache directories. The obfuscation via nonsensical variable names complicates straightforward understanding but does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or system disruption mechanisms are present. Functions perform legitimate mathematical and system setup tasks, consistent with standard signal processing utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate set of utility functions for signal analysis and cache management. The obfuscation and complex mathematical computations do not inherently imply malicious behavior. No evidence of malware or malicious data flow was identified. Overall security risk is low, with no concerning behaviors detected.",
