  "conclusion": "The code is likely legitimate scientific or utility signal processing code with intentional obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware, malicious data flow, or external communication. The obfuscation could be for intellectual property or concealment but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable; I recommend setting the malware score to 0.0, maintaining a high obfuscation score (~0.75), and a low security risk (~0.2)."
