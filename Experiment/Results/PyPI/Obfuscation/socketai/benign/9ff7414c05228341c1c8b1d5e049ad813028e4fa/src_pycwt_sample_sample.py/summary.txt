  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific analysis script with heavy obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal variable names rather than hide malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the absence of malicious activity."
