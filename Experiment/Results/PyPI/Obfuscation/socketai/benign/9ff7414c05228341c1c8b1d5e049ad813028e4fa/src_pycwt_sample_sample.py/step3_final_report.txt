{
  "purpose": "Performs wavelet analysis on climate data ('NINO3'), generating plots.",
  "sources": "Data from a dataset object; no untrusted external input.",
  "sinks": "Saves a PNG image, no network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset through normalization, analysis, plotting.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, no hardcoded credentials or network activity.",
  "analysis": "Standard scientific code, obfuscation appears to be for concealment, not malicious. No suspicious network or data exfiltration detected. The code performs typical data normalization, wavelet transform, and plotting routines. No malicious system modifications or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scientific analysis script with heavy obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal variable names rather than hide malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the absence of malicious activity.",
