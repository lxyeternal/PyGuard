{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform wavelet-based signal analysis, significance testing, and wavelet coherence computations, likely for scientific or signal processing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data from files loaded via numpy.loadtxt; data read from signals, time series, and parameter inputs; environment variables are not directly accessed; data is received from function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Computed arrays and results are returned; no direct data leaks or system commands executed; no network connections, file writes (except optional caching), or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into processing functions, through mathematical transformations and statistical computations, ultimately returning processed signals and significance metrics; no untrusted data flows to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamically constructed function names and obfuscated variable names; complex nested function calls; conditional loading of cached significance data; heavy reliance on numpy and custom modules without clear documentation; presence of placeholder or intentionally vague functions like 'QmfStggawitMCxFVQtBqMlVtczUYMXDX'. No hardcoded secrets or credentials observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs signal normalization, wavelet transform computations, significance testing using chi-squared distributions, and significance caching via file I/O. It uses obfuscated variable names and dynamic function selection, which could be masking malicious intent, but the overall operations are consistent with scientific signal analysis. There are no network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The use of cached significance data and modular design indicates a focus on computational efficiency and reproducibility. No suspicious behaviors such as hidden backdoors, data theft, or malicious payloads are evident. The code is complex and somewhat opaque, possibly intentionally so, but does not display signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears to be a sophisticated scientific or signal processing implementation involving wavelet analysis and significance testing. There are obfuscated elements and dynamic behaviors that raise some concern about intent, but no clear evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage. Its primary function seems legitimate within the context of advanced signal analysis.",
