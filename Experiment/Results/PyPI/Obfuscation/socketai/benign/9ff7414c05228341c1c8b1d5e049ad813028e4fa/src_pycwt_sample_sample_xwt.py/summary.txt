  "conclusion": "The script is a heavily obfuscated scientific visualization tool analyzing climate data. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or system sabotage. The main concern is obfuscation, which could conceal malicious code, but based on the visible code, the overall security risk is low."
