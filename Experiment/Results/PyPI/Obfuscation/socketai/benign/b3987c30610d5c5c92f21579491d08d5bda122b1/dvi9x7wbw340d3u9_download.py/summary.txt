  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, suspicious shebang options, and segmented download behavior, all indicative of potential malicious intent. While no direct malicious actions are confirmed, the pattern aligns with covert payload delivery mechanisms. It should be treated with caution and analyzed further in a controlled environment before use."
