{
  "purpose": "The code implements an NLP visualization tool that loads external models and JavaScript resources to generate SVG-based visualizations of linguistic data.",
  "sources": "External model files (e.g., 'ud-kanbun.udpipe', 'mecabrc'), JavaScript files ('conllusvgview.js'), and user input sentences.",
  "sinks": "Embedding of external JavaScript into SVGs, dynamic SVG content generation, potential injection points if external files are compromised.",
  "flows": "Input sentences are processed, external models are loaded, SVG content is dynamically generated with embedded scripts, and external JavaScript files are read and inserted into SVG outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names, suspicious shebang line with unusual flags, dynamic resource loading without sanitization, complex attribute handling that conceals code logic.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily obfuscates its internal structure through variable and class names, making static analysis difficult. It loads external models and JavaScript files, which could be manipulated if those files are compromised. The shebang line includes unusual flags that may be used to evade detection. The code dynamically constructs SVGs with embedded scripts, which could be exploited for cross-site scripting if served in a web context. No network activity or system modifications indicative of malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation and external dependencies are typical for visualization tools but pose potential security risks if external resources are maliciously altered or if the obfuscation conceals malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an NLP visualization utility with significant obfuscation and reliance on external resources. While no explicit malicious activity is detected, the external dependencies and obfuscation introduce moderate security concerns. The overall malware likelihood is low, but external resource integrity should be verified, and the code should be deobfuscated for thorough security assessment.",
