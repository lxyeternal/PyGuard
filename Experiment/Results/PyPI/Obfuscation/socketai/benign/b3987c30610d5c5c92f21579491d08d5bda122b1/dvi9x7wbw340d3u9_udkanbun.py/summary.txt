  "conclusion": "The code functions as an NLP visualization utility with significant obfuscation and reliance on external resources. While no explicit malicious activity is detected, the external dependencies and obfuscation introduce moderate security concerns. The overall malware likelihood is low, but external resource integrity should be verified, and the code should be deobfuscated for thorough security assessment."
