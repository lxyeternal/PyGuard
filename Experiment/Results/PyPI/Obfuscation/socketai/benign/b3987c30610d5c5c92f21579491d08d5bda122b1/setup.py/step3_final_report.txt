  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, performing environment detection and dependency configuration based on system environment.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', checks platform info, executes 'subprocess.check_output(['mecab-config', '--libs-only-L'])' to detect system utilities, and uses environment info for dependency selection.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks; subprocess call is a system utility check, not a data sink.",
  "flows": "Reads environment info and system utility availability to determine dependencies; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names; reliance on subprocess for environment detection; no explicit error handling for subprocess failures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with environment detection logic. Obfuscated variable names are superficial and do not execute malicious code. The subprocess call to 'mecab-config' is typical for dependency detection but could be misused if environment is compromised; however, in this context, it is benign. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent, and the dependency logic is system-based. Overall, the script appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The low malware and risk scores are justified, and the obfuscation does not imply malicious intent.",
