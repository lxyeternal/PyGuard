  "purpose": "Import obfuscated attributes from a local module, potentially for concealed or malicious purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.udkanbun' module, importing multiple long, nonsensical attribute names.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external interactions are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond the import statement; no further code provided.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, nonsensical attribute names; import from a local module with no context; potential concealment tactic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with obfuscated attribute names, which raises suspicion of concealment or malicious intent. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution is present. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide functionality, but without additional context or code, malicious behavior cannot be confirmed. The high obfuscation scores in reports are justified, but malware scores based solely on obfuscation may be overstated. The overall risk is moderate, warranting further investigation into the module's contents and usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation that is suspicious but not definitively malicious. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but without further evidence, the likelihood of malicious intent remains moderate. Additional analysis of the module and runtime behavior is recommended before confirming malicious activity.",
