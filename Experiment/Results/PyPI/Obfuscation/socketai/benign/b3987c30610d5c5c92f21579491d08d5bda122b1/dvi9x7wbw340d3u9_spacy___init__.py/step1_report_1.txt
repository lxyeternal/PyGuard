  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from a local module named 'udkanbun2spacy'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module within the package.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or output operations shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow is visible in this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are long, seemingly random strings, which could suggest obfuscation or generated names, but are not inherently malicious. The code itself does not perform any actions beyond import.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module. The imported symbols have non-descriptive, complex names, which could be a sign of obfuscation or code generation. There are no functions, data handling, or control flows present. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors in this snippet. However, the unusual naming warrants attention if further code reveals obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard import statement with suspiciously complex identifier names. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscated naming raises some suspicion. Overall, this appears to be a benign import unless further code shows malicious intent.",
