  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from a local module named 'udkanbun2spacy'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a relative module file in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names appear as random strings, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, but could also be simply non-descriptive variable names. No other suspicious code or obfuscation techniques are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of specific identifiers from a local module. The imported identifiers are non-descriptive and appear as randomly generated strings, which could suggest obfuscation. No additional code, such as network calls, file operations, or dynamic execution, is present to evaluate. The import is from a relative module, not external sources, reducing the likelihood of external malicious payloads. Given the minimal context, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code only imports specific classes or functions from a local module with obfuscated-looking names. There are no signs of malicious activity, no suspicious data flows, and no obfuscation beyond the naming. Based on this fragment alone, it appears benign, but the unusual naming warrants caution in the broader context.",
