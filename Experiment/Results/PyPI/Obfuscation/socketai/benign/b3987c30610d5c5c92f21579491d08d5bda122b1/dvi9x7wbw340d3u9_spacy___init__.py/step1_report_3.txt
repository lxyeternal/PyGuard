  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from a local module named 'udkanbun2spacy'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reading from '.udkanbun2spacy'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, output, or external connections present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads classes/functions; no data flow or processing visible.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are obfuscated or randomly generated strings, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious; no explicit secrets or code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import from a local module using relative import syntax. The imported identifiers appear to be obfuscated or randomly generated, which might be an attempt to hide the actual functionality or could be code obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. No parameters, data processing, or external interactions are visible that could pose security risks. Given only this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement with obfuscated identifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The obfuscated names could be suspicious but are not definitive evidence of malicious intent.",
