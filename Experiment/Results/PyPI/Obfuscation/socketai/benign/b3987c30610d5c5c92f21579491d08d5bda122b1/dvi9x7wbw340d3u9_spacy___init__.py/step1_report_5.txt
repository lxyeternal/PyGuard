  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from a local module within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing symbols from '.udkanbun2spacy' module",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling or external effects",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbols have obfuscated or nonsensical names; no comments or context; the module name suggests standard functionality but names are suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import statement, importing multiple classes or functions with seemingly random or obfuscated names from a local module. No data input, no external network access, no file operations, and no dynamic code execution are present. The naming pattern raises suspicion about potential obfuscation or malicious intent, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions. Lack of context prevents definitive conclusions, but the code is minimal and benign in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a simple import statement with obfuscated symbol names. While suspicious naming could indicate obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior in this code alone. No active malicious actions or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
