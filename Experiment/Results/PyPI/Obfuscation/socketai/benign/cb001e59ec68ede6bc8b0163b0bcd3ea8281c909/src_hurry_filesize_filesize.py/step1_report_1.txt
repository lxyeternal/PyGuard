{
  "purpose": "The code defines several unit conversion tables and a function to format byte sizes into human-readable strings using specified systems (SI, binary, etc.).",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'bytes' of the function 'RanauANioXyfZIkAeGZzGVEYHlXODFmD'.",
  "sinks": "The function converts input bytes into formatted size strings; no external sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Bytes are compared against system thresholds, and the appropriate size unit is selected for formatting.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed. The code uses standard conversion logic. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The function performs size formatting without side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code contains several predefined conversion tables for bytes, kibibytes, gibibytes, etc., in different systems (decimal, binary, and mixed). The function 'RanauANioXyfZIkAeGZzGVEYHlXODFmD' takes a byte value and a system (defaulting to the first system). It iterates over the system's thresholds, selects the appropriate unit, and formats the byte value accordingly. The code performs standard size formatting, with no indication of malicious or harmful behavior. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and aligns with common size conversion functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a size formatting utility with obfuscated variable names. It performs standard, benign operations without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No security risks are identified.",
