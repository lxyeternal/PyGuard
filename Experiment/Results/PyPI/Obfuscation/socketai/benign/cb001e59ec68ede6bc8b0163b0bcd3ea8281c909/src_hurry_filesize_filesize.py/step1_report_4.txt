{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to convert a byte size into a human-readable string format with various unit systems (SI, binary, decimal, and SI prefixes with large units).",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'bytes' of the function 'RanauANioXyfZIkAeGZzGVEYHlXODFmD', which is used for size conversion.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a string that represents the converted size; no data is sent elsewhere or stored persistently.",
  "flows": "The input 'bytes' flows into the function, is compared against predefined unit thresholds, and then the calculated size and unit are combined into a string for output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors. The code is a straightforward size conversion utility. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors are evident. No dynamic execution or external calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple unit systems with thresholds for size conversions (bytes to petabytes, etc.). The main function 'RanauANioXyfZIkAeGZzGVEYHlXODFmD' selects the appropriate unit based on the input byte size. It handles both singular and plural forms when provided with tuple units. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to be a utility for size formatting, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign size conversion utility that formats byte sizes into human-readable strings across various unit systems. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
