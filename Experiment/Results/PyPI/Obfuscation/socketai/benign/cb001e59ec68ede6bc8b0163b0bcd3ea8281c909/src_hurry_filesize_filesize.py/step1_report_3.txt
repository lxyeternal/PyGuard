{
  "purpose": "The function converts a byte count into a human-readable string with appropriate units, supporting multiple measurement systems.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'bytes' and the default 'system' list of unit mappings.",
  "sinks": "The return statement generates a string output; no untrusted data is written to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input 'bytes' is compared against unit thresholds, then converted to a human-readable format based on the largest fitting unit.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes many variables with obfuscated names, but their usage appears standard and related to unit conversion. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple lists for unit conversions across different measurement systems. The main function iterates over a selected system, finds the largest unit smaller than the input bytes, and formats the output accordingly. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and typical for byte-to-human-readable conversions. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are observed. No external or hidden data operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation for converting byte counts into human-readable formats supporting various measurement systems. It contains no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation of variable names is likely for code compression or concealment but does not indicate malicious intent.",
