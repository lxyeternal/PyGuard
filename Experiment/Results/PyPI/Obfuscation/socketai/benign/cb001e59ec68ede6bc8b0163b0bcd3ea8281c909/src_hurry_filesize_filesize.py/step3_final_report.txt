{
  "purpose": "A utility function that converts a byte count into a human-readable string using various unit systems (binary, decimal, SI prefixes, etc.).",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'bytes' and the 'system' list defining thresholds and labels.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a string; no external data sinks or network activity are involved.",
  "flows": "The function compares 'bytes' against thresholds in 'system', calculates the scaled value, and formats the output string based on the unit label.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are heavily obfuscated; no malicious code or suspicious patterns are present. The code is straightforward and utility-focused.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple size unit tables supporting different systems. The function iterates over the chosen system list to find the appropriate unit threshold, then computes the scaled size and formats it into a string. Variable obfuscation is present but does not indicate malicious intent. No external interactions, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are detected. The logic is standard for size formatting utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard size formatting utility with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or compression, not malicious purposes.",
