{
  "purpose": "The function converts a byte count into a human-readable string with appropriate units, supporting multiple measurement systems.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'bytes' (byte value), optional 'system' parameter defaulting to a list of units with binary prefixes.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a string representing the converted value; no external sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input 'bytes' is compared against predefined unit thresholds, then used to compute the scaled value, which is formatted as a string.",
  "anomalies": "The code structure is straightforward with no obfuscated or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several unit lists for different measurement systems, then implements a function that selects the appropriate unit based on the input byte value. The function performs a comparison to determine the largest fitting unit, calculates the scaled number, and formats the output string accordingly. The logic appears to be standard and intended for human-readable size formatting, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple unit converter for byte sizes into human-readable formats. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate utility code for formatting byte sizes.",
