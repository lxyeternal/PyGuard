  "purpose": "Define a namespace package for the module, enabling the distribution of sub-packages across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "The import statements for 'pkg_resources' and 'pkgutil', which are used to declare and extend namespace packages.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions based on external input.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import 'pkg_resources' and declare a namespace; if that fails, it falls back to 'pkgutil' to extend the namespace path.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected. The code uses standard namespace package declaration patterns; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a try-except block to attempt importing 'pkg_resources' and declare a namespace, which is a common pattern for supporting namespace packages. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to 'pkgutil' to extend the namespace path. Both are standard practices in Python package management and do not perform any malicious actions. There are no sources or sinks that handle untrusted data, nor any suspicious flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a typical implementation for defining a namespace package in Python. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The purpose is to support namespace packages, and it employs common, well-understood patterns without any malicious intent.",
