{
  "purpose": "This code sets up a namespace package for a Python distribution, allowing multiple packages to share the same namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __name__ variable to declare a namespace or extend the package path.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or cause security effects are present.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing modules and modifying __path__, which are internal operations with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses conditional import and namespace declaration, which is standard for namespace packages. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace using pkg_resources; if that fails due to ImportError, it falls back to extending __path__ with pkgutil. Both are common practices for setting up namespace packages in Python. No external input, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious code flows or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup for a namespace package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
