  "purpose": "Standard namespace package setup using pkg_resources and pkgutil fallback",
  "sources": "Import statements for pkg_resources and pkgutil, usage of declare_namespace and extend_path functions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external communication or data processing",
  "flows": "Import of pkg_resources or pkgutil → declaration or extension of __path__",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code follows well-known pattern for namespace packages",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package with pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__). If pkg_resources is unavailable, it falls back to extending __path__ with pkgutil.extend_path(__path__, __name__). Both are standard practices in Python packaging. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets. The fallback mechanism is benign and widely used. No external inputs or network interactions are involved. The security risk is minimal, primarily due to the potential for path manipulation, but this is a standard pattern with negligible risk in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard pattern for namespace package declaration with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 or 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
