  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to perform data processing or communication tasks based on the functions and variables used.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and imported modules; potentially also from external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Data is sent to output functions, network calls, or written to files; any use of eval, exec, or subprocess calls could be critical sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions and then to sinks like network transmission or file writing.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious use of eval or exec, obfuscated code patterns, or unusual dynamic imports are potential anomalies. Any code that handles secrets insecurely or communicates with unknown domains is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard library imports and functions that process data. No obvious hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. However, any dynamic execution (like eval or exec) or network communication code should be scrutinized closely. If there are obscure or convoluted code sections, they could be obfuscation attempts. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious network activities are explicitly visible in the provided code snippet. Given the absence of such indicators, the code appears standard but should be reviewed in context.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code seems to perform typical data processing tasks without suspicious or malicious patterns. However, without the full context, some risk cannot be entirely ruled out, especially if dynamic code execution or external communication is involved.",
