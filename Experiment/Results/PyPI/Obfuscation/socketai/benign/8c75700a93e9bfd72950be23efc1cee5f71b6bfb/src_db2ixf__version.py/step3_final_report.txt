  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, input handling, network operations, environment variables, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file operations, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network transmission or file modification.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, unusual imports, or patterns indicating backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and incomplete, with no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. No network activity or dynamic code execution is evident. The code appears benign, with no indicators of malicious intent. The scores reflect low malware likelihood (0), no obfuscation (0), and low security risk (0.2). Confidence levels are moderate to high (0.6-0.8), appropriate given the limited snippets. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified, and the analysis aligns with the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware and obfuscation scores are justified, and the security risk remains minimal. The assessments are consistent and appropriate given the limited code visibility.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
