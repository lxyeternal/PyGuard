{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for concealment or generated code, without any executable logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with obfuscated names; no input or data reading points present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or potential data leak points; no external communication or data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares classes without runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names that appear randomly generated; lack of logic or data handling; no external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception with obfuscated names, indicating no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation suggests code concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Malware scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Security risk scores are low, acknowledging obfuscation but not indicating threats. The high obfuscation scores are justified given the class names. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The code is benign and does not pose security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The obfuscation alone does not warrant concern, and the scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
