  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "The class definitions themselves; no external data input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are named with seemingly random, obfuscated identifiers; no actual implementation or logic is present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception, with unusual, obfuscated class names. No data input, external communication, or suspicious behavior detected. The classes appear to be placeholders or part of obfuscation, but do not perform any malicious actions themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be obfuscated class declarations without any malicious intent or security risks.",
