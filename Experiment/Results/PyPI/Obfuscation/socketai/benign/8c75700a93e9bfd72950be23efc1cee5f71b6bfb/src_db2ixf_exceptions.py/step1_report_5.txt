{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes for potential error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths since the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The exception class names appear obfuscated, consisting of random characters, which is unusual. The code does not include any meaningful comments, documentation, or typical class structure. The naming pattern suggests possible obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious behavior is explicitly visible.",
  "analysis": "The code defines five custom exception classes with obscure, non-descriptive names. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The class names do not follow conventional naming practices and seem randomly generated. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears to serve only as a namespace or obfuscation technique, which could be suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely consists of obfuscated custom exception class definitions with no clear malicious intent or security risks. While the naming appears intentionally obscure, there is no evidence of malware or harmful behavior based on this snippet.",
