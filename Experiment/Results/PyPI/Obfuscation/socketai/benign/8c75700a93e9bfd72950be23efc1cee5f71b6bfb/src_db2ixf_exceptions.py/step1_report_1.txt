{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger application or module.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and exception inheritance (from Exception). No input or external data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could be exploited or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists since these are just class declarations with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names that are randomly generated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains the definition of five custom exception classes, each inheriting from the built-in Exception class. The class names appear random or obfuscated, but the structure is standard Python class inheritance for exceptions. There is no input handling, no external data, and no executable logic that could be malicious or suspicious. The code seems to be a part of a larger project, potentially generated or obfuscated, but on its own, it does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless on its own. It merely defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names, which is common in code obfuscation or code generation scenarios. No malicious intent or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
