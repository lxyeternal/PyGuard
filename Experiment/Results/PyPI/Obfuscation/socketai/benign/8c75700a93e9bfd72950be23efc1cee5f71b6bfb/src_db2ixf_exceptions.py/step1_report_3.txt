  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a larger Python program.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that declare new exception types, which are typically used for error handling within the application.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or output data. No data or input flows are observable in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows; the code only declares exception classes without any data processing or I/O operations.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are named with seemingly random strings; no comments or documentation are provided. The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception, with no additional logic, making it appear obfuscated or intentionally vague.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple class declarations that define custom exceptions, each inheriting from Python's built-in Exception class. The class names appear as random strings, which might be an attempt at obfuscation. There are no functions, data handling, or external interactions, which limits observable malicious behavior. The absence of logic or data flow suggests these are simply placeholder or obfuscated exception class definitions. There are no signs of malicious activity, such as network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors, present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be either part of a larger codebase with obfuscated naming or a placeholder for future error handling logic. There are no indications of malware, malicious intent, or security risks in this snippet.",
