      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented parser for IBM DB2 file formats. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or active security threats. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are appropriate. The security risk score (0.1-0.2) reflects minimal concerns related to processing untrusted files without validation, but does not indicate malicious activity."

There are no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or supply chain security issues. The low malware and security risk scores are justified and should remain as such."

      "conclusion": "The code appears heavily obfuscated with placeholder or autogenerated identifiers, with no executable logic or malicious activity evident in this snippet. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no direct evidence of malware. Further review of actual implementation code is necessary to confirm safety. The high obfuscation level suggests potential concealment, so it should be treated with suspicion until thoroughly analyzed."

There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious behavior, but the obfuscation warrants further review of actual implementation code to rule out hidden threats."
