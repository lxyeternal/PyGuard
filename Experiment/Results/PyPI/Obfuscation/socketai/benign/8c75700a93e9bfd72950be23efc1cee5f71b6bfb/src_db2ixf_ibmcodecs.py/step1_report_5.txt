  "sources": "Input data may be read from external sources such as files, network, environment variables, or user input, but specifics are not provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, system commands, or environment variable access, though explicit details are not visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (input) to sinks (output or external communication), but explicit source and sink points are not specified in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are visible. No hidden or malicious patterns detected from the provided fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is either missing or empty, preventing detailed analysis.
