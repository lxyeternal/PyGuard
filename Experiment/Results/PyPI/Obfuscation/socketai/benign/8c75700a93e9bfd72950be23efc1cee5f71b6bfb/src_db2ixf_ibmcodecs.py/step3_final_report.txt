  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of an open source Python dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No actual code provided; summaries indicate benign or suspicious features.",
  "sinks": "Potential network, file, or environment variable interactions; suspicious patterns noted in some reports.",
  "flows": "Descriptions suggest source-to-sink flows are typical, with suspicious indicators in Report 4.",
  "anomalies": "Report 4 highlights hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, and suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "Benign reports (1, 2, 3, 5) show no suspicious patterns; their low malware and obfuscation scores are justified. Report 4 exhibits multiple suspicious features, warranting high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.6), and security risk (0.8) scores. Confidence levels are appropriate given the summaries. Overall, scores align with descriptions, with benign reports showing minimal risk and Report 4 indicating significant concern.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are benign with low security risk; Report 4 indicates likely malicious behavior justifying high scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the provided summaries and suspicious indicators.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
