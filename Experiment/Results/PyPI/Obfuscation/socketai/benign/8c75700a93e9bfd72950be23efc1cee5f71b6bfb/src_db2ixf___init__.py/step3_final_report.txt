  "purpose": "Parser for IBM DB2 PC/JqXwjCjfsqxmdEniknuSTxpWznqaIkkv file format, extracting structured records such as Header, Table, Column Descriptor, Data, and Application.",
  "sources": "Reads binary data from files based on documented record formats and data types.",
  "sinks": "No external network or system modifications; primarily reads data into memory.",
  "flows": "Reads data from file (source) and processes into structured records (sink), with no untrusted data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or unusual patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a structured binary file parser referencing official documentation. It reads data sequentially, interprets record types, and extracts fields based on specified lengths and data types. No malicious logic, obfuscation, or network activity is present. The parser handles known formats and does not perform any code execution or external communication. Potential risks are limited to mishandling untrusted input, which is typical for parsers but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, well-documented parser for IBM DB2 file formats. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or active security threats. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are appropriate. The security risk score (0.1-0.2) reflects minimal concerns related to processing untrusted files without validation, but does not indicate malicious activity.",
