  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious behavior, code logic, and scoring consistency.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Focuses on fixing timestamp and time data types for Delta Lake compatibility, converting nanoseconds to microseconds, and replacing unsupported time types with strings.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, which aligns with the analysis; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, indicating minimal concern, justified by the utility nature of the code.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion that the code is legitimate and solely for schema fixes is reasonable. The reasoning is sound, and the scores are appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes schema transformations and decoding, with no malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, still low, justified by the code's utility focus.\n- **Assessment:** The report's conclusion of legitimacy and lack of malicious behavior is justified. The scores are reasonable.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Describes schema manipulation and timestamp conversions, with no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, consistent with the benign nature.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis aligns with the code's purpose, and the scoring is appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar focus on schema and data decoding, handling Delta Lake compatibility.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, matching the benign description.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1, justified.\n- **Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as legitimate utility routines.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Addresses schema fixes and encoding conversions, with potential concerns about untrusted input.\n- **Malware Score:** 0, which is reasonable given no malicious code is observed.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2, reflecting cautiousness about untrusted data, but no actual malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is thorough; the scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All reports indicate 0, which is correct.\n- **Security Risk:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), justified by the functions' potential to process untrusted data, but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious actions are present.\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious code detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is clear and well-documented)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, justified by the possibility of untrusted inputs but no active threats)\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The code snippets are utility functions for schema management, addressing known platform limitations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent.\n- The scores are consistent with the described functionality and analysis.\n\n**In conclusion,** I agree with the provided scores. The code is legitimate, and the risk is minimal. No adjustments are necessary based on the reports.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (average ~0.15)",
