  "purpose": "This code is intended to set up and configure a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setup' from the 'setuptools' module.",
  "sinks": "The code executes 'setup()' which may accept untrusted configuration data if parameters are added (not in this snippet).",
  "flows": "Import 'setup' from 'setuptools' -> call 'setup()' with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and uses standard setup process.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' library and immediately invokes it with default parameters. No arguments are provided, indicating a typical minimal setup script. There are no signs of malicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated behavior. The code is simple and standard for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a normal setup invocation without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a benign, standard package setup script.",
