  "flows": "There are no data flows, input, or output operations within this minimal script.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal, performing only a setup invocation with no additional logic or hidden behavior.",

There are no suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated elements present. The script does not include any external data reading, network activity, or potentially malicious operations. The simplicity and common usage of 'setup()' indicate this is a typical package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard use of setuptools for Python package configuration.",
