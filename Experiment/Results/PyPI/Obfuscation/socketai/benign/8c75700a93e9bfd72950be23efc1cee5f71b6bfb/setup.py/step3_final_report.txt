  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for Python packaging using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import of setuptools and invocation of setup() with no arguments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external input processed.",
  "flows": "Straightforward call from import to setup(), no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is minimal, standard, and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() without arguments, which is a common minimal packaging script. It does not process external data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious constructs. The code is clear, simple, and aligns with typical packaging practices. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign Python setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate and appropriately score the code as safe.",
