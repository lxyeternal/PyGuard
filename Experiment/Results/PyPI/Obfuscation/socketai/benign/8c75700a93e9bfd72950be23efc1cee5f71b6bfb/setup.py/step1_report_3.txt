  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or where malicious actions could be triggered.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the setup() call executes without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is minimal and follows standard packaging practices.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with default parameters, which is typical for package configuration. There are no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, and no external data handling. The code is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious or malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and purely used for Python package setup. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior risks.",
