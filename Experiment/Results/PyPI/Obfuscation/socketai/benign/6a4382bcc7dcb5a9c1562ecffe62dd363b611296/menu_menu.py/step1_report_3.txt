{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a menu interface for a program, handling user input and display on Windows systems with Python 3.6+.",
  "sources": "Reads input from the keyboard via 'keyboard' module, data from function arguments, and system info such as OS and Python version.",
  "sinks": "Uses print statements to display menu and options, and manipulates recursion limit; no direct data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input from keyboard (source) triggers control flow (next/prev selection) and display updates (sink), with flow through event loops and function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Use of global variables is typical for UI state management but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for menu handling with input controls, display formatting, and theme support. It performs OS and Python version checks, sets recursion limit, and processes user input for menu navigation. The imports are primarily for system, time, and user interface functionality. The code manages menu options, themes, and user interactions with key bindings. No network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration appears to occur. The code structure and logic are consistent with a user interface component, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This source code implements a Windows-specific menu interface with input handling and display logic. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks; all operations are related to UI management. The code appears benign and aligned with its apparent purpose.",
