{
  "purpose": "A Windows-specific CLI menu system with input handling, theming, and environment enforcement.",
  "sources": "Keyboard input via 'keyboard' library, environment info (OS, Python version), global variables, imported local modules/functions.",
  "sinks": "Console output for menu display and navigation, no network or file operations detected.",
  "flows": "User key presses trigger menu navigation; input flows into control logic; display functions output menu options.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, broad try-except blocks, dynamic global variables, reliance on external modules that could be tampered with, environment checks for OS and Python version.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a menu interface with input handling, environment validation, and theming. No network activity, data exfiltration, or destructive system commands are present. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment or complexity, not malicious intent. Global variables and dynamic imports are typical in UI code but warrant caution. Environment checks ensure compatibility but are not malicious. The broad exception handling could hide errors but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign, obfuscated CLI menu system designed for Windows with Python 3.6+. No evidence suggests malicious activity or supply chain security issues. The primary concern is maintainability due to obfuscation, but security-wise, it appears safe.",
