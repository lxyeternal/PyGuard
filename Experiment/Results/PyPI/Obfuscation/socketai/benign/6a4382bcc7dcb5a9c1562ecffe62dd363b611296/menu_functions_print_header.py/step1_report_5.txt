  "purpose": "Defines a function to print a header or page title with styling, based on provided parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameter AHyVKeZVnVeBFgDEXykPiDZCcewYTUhk; indirectly, program_name and page_name variables, if used in broader context.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; print statements output data, but no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (program_name, AHyVKeZVnVeBFgDEXykPiDZCcewYTUhk) influence print output based on condition, with no complex data flow or external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., jpGZOjGOwmjlwNqtUazKSbOczKbCfBKt) suggest obfuscation or code generation, but no malicious activity detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a theme module, defines a function with a long, seemingly random name, which conditionally prints styled text. The function's logic appears straightforward, involving conditional printing with formatting. No code injection, external data exfiltration, or malicious behavior identified. The obfuscated function name could be an anomaly, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No network or file operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple styling print function with obfuscated naming, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It is likely part of a larger application and does not pose an immediate threat.",
