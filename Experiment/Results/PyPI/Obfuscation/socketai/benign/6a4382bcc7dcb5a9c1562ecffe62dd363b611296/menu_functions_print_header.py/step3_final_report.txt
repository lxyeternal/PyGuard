  "purpose": "Utility function for printing styled headers in console output.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'program_name' and 'AHyVKeZVnVeBFgDEXykPiDZCcewYTUhk'; external theme modules 'menu.classes.theme' providing styling variables.",
  "sinks": "Print statements that output styled text; no untrusted data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the formatted print output; no data flows to external systems or files.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name and variable names; reliance on external modules for styling; no validation or sanitization of inputs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign utility for styled console headers, with obfuscated naming possibly for stylistic or structural reasons. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. External dependencies are assumed safe but represent a dependency risk if compromised. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent, and the logic is straightforward. Scores from reports align with this assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, styled header printing utility with moderate obfuscation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation warrants attention but does not imply malicious intent. Scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0.6, risk=0.2.",
