{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a utility function for printing formatted headers or titles in a program's menu interface.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'program_name' and 'AHyVKeZVnVeBFgDEXykPiDZCcewYTUhk', and imported module 'menu.classes.theme'.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs to the console using print statements, which could potentially display untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in formatted print statements, with conditional logic determining the output style.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. Usage of imported themes suggests reliance on external styling; no malicious code appears involved.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that conditionally prints a styled header based on whether a parameter is None. It accesses attributes from 'color_theme' and 'formatting', which are presumed to be part of the imported theme module. No dynamic execution, external network activity, or data manipulation beyond printing is observed. The code structure is straightforward and appears to serve a UI purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for formatted console output. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified based on the provided snippet.",
