  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module exports and import functions/classes from other parts of a package, likely for a menu system.",

    "from .menu import *",

  "flows": [
    "Imports from other modules and assigns a version variable; no explicit data flows involving untrusted input or external data"
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of wildcard imports ('*'), which can obscure the source of functions or classes, and can lead to potential namespace pollution",
    "Assignment of string literals to variables with seemingly random names, possibly obfuscation",
    "Assignment '__version__ = version' assumes 'version' is defined elsewhere; could cause runtime error if not properly imported or defined"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module import operations and sets some string variables with hardcoded values. The import statements use wildcard imports, which are generally discouraged but are not inherently malicious. The variable '__version__' depends on 'version' being defined; if 'version' is not properly imported or initialized elsewhere, this could cause an error, but it is not malicious. There are no signs of data leakage, code injection, or malicious intent. The random-looking variable names suggest possible obfuscation but do not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code does not perform any malicious actions or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily setup and import code with some obfuscated variable names and a potential issue with the '__version__' assignment. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on this snippet.",
