  "purpose": "Module setup and metadata definition with obfuscated variable names and wildcard imports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules and submodules, string variable assignments, class import.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external system interactions detected.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports, obfuscated class and variable names, undefined 'version' variable.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports and defines metadata variables. The use of wildcard imports can lead to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. The class name and variable names appear obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent but do not indicate malicious behavior. The assignment '__version__ = version' will cause a runtime error unless 'version' is defined externally; this is a minor flaw. No network activity, data leaks, or code injection are present. The overall structure suggests standard package setup with obfuscation rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation and minor issues like the undefined 'version'. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation moderate, and low security risk.",
