  "purpose": "To import modules and classes related to menu functionality and define some metadata variables.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and package variables (e.g., __version__).",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data is written to external systems, files, or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable assignments; no data flow to untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import patterns with star imports; presence of obfuscated variable names; __version__ is assigned from an undefined 'version' variable which may cause runtime error.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements from relative modules and simple variable assignments. The star imports ('from .menu import *', etc.) are often discouraged but not inherently malicious. The variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious. The variable '__version__' is set to 'version', which is undefined in this snippet, potentially causing a runtime error but not malicious. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module initialization with obfuscated variable names and star imports. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The primary concern is the use of star imports and undefined 'version' variable, which could lead to runtime errors but not malicious activity.",
