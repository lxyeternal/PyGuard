  "purpose": "Validate input parameters for a function that seems to handle menu configurations or UI settings.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: AHyVKeZVnVeBFgDEXykPiDZCcewYTUhk, dzEsghFulmrtlfByIUdcpakIbEbvFCsN, menu_text, theme.",
  "sinks": "Potential exception raising with custom exception IcEYSnKXTfTzEbOyeDwnxmdOlMkBMPqt when input types are invalid.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are checked for type; if invalid, exceptions are raised. Otherwise, function completes normally.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated; exception class imported via wildcard, making it less clear. Validation messages reference 'page_name' and 'menu_items', but the parameters are named differently, indicating possible inconsistency or obfuscation. No external data sources or network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs type checks on parameters, raising exceptions if types do not match expectations. The variable names are obscure and do not follow descriptive naming conventions, suggesting possible obfuscation. The validation logic is straightforward and does not include any malicious or suspicious activity. No data leaks, external calls, or malicious code behavior are present. The exception messages reference parameter names that do not match the actual function parameter names, indicating either obfuscation or incomplete code. No harmful or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an input validation function with obfuscated naming conventions. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The main concern is the obfuscation and inconsistent messaging, but no malicious intent is detected.",
