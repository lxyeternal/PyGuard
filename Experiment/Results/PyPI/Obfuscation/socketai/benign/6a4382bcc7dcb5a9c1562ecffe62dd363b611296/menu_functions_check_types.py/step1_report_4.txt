  "purpose": "The function validates input parameters related to menu configuration, including page name, menu items, optional menu text, and theme.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: AHyVKeZVnVeBFgDEXykPiDZCcewYTUhk, dzEsghFulmrtlfByIUdcpakIbEbvFCsN, menu_text, theme",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises exceptions with formatted messages; no other sinks are present",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated through type checks, and exceptions are raised if validation fails",
  "anomalies": "The function performs standard type validation without unusual code; variable names are obfuscated but not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code begins by importing exceptions, then defines a function with heavily obfuscated parameter names. It performs type validation for each parameter, raising exceptions with custom messages if validation fails. The messages reference 'page_name' and 'menu_items' even though the parameters are named differently, indicating potential inconsistency or obfuscation. The code does not include any external data input, network operations, or system modifications. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are present. The structure is simple and consistent with standard input validation routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard parameter validation with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be superficial, possibly to hinder analysis, but the code itself is benign.",
