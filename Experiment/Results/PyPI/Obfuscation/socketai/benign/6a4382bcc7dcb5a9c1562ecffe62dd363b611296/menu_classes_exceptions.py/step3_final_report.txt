{
  "purpose": "Defines a list of exception names and three custom exception classes, including one with an obfuscated class name.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and a list of exception names; no external data or input handling.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static code with no external interactions.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation flows are straightforward; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name 'gphUHxrcyreyWwCdvgFdcHFRlGAnrAYP' suggests obfuscation, potentially to conceal purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, defining custom exceptions and a list. The only suspicious element is the obfuscated class name, which could be used to hide intent but does not inherently indicate malicious activity. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. The exception classes are simple and standard. The obfuscation score is moderate due to the class name, but malware and security risks are effectively zero. The code appears benign and likely part of a larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is low risk, with a moderate suspicion level due to obfuscation of the class name. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is detected. The current scores are appropriate, with the obfuscation score slightly elevated but justified.",
