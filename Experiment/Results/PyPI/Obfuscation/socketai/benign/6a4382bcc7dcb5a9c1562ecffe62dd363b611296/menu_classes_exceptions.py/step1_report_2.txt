  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and an exported list of exception names.",
  "sources": "The list __all__ at the top, and the class definitions for custom exceptions.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks; no untrusted data handling or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes and a list.",
  "anomalies": "The class names are obfuscated or intentionally obscure, but this alone is not suspicious. The code does not perform any suspicious operations or include malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares an exported list of exception class names and defines three custom exception classes, each with an __init__ method that optionally sets a message attribute. The class names are somewhat obfuscated but functionally harmless. There is no input/output, data handling, or external communication. No malware indicators, malicious behaviors, or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of benign class definitions and an exported list, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It appears to be part of a larger codebase where these exceptions are used. No security risks are present based on this snippet.",
