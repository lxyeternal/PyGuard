{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a list of exception names for use in other parts of a program.",
  "sources": "The list '__all__' indicating exported names, and the class definitions which contain exception initializers.",
  "tails": "No external inputs or untrusted data sources are used within the code; the code only defines classes and a list.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flows from sources to sinks, as there are no input or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Classes inherit from standard exception types and simply assign messages; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of exception names and three custom exception classes, each inheriting from standard exceptions and initializing an optional message. The structure is straightforward and consistent with common Python practices. There are no indications of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leaks. No external inputs or network activity are present. The code appears solely to set up exception handling infrastructure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a definition of custom exceptions and a list of exception names. No malicious intent, suspicious activity, or security risks are evident.",
