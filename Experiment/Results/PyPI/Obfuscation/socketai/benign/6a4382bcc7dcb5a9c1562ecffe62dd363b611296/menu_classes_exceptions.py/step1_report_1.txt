  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a list of exception identifiers for use in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or external data; it only defines classes and a list.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only sets up class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'gphUHxrcyreyWwCdvgFdcHFRlGAnrAYP' appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which might suggest intent to conceal. The exception classes are straightforward, but the obfuscated class name raises suspicion of obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of exception names and three custom exception classes. The class names and structure are standard, but one class name is highly obfuscated, which could indicate an attempt to hide purpose or behavior. There are no apparent malicious actions such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The code is static and solely for exception handling, with no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup of custom exceptions with no malicious intent. The obfuscated class name might suggest code hiding but does not indicate malicious behavior on its own. Overall, there is low suspicion of malware or security risk based on this snippet.",
