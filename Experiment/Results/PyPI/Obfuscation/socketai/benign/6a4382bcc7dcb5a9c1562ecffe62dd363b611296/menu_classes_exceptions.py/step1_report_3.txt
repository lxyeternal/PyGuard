{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and a list of exception names for import",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data from external sources",
  "targets": "None; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "The code only defines custom exceptions with simple constructors; no suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists of an exported list of exception names and three custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions. Each class initializes a message attribute if arguments are provided, otherwise sets it to None. There are no external inputs, network calls, or potentially dangerous behaviors observed. The code appears to be purely structural, intended for use elsewhere, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward definition of custom exception classes and a list of exception names. There are no malicious behaviors, security issues, or obfuscation present. The code's purpose appears to be structural or organizational, with no indications of malicious activity.",
