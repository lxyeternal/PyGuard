  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error scenarios related to menu operations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; the code primarily defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no data leaks or external effects evident.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input/output, or untrusted data propagation within this code.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes class definitions that extend standard exceptions, with custom message handling. No suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation present. The exception classes are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of exception names and three custom exception classes, each extending standard Python exceptions (Exception, TypeError, ImportError). Each class's __init__ method sets a message attribute if arguments are provided, otherwise None. The structure is simple and does not include any external calls, network activity, or potentially malicious code. No anomalies such as obfuscation, hidden code, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of exception class definitions intended for error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or suspicious activity.",
