  "purpose": "Utility classes for terminal styling and string manipulation, primarily setting color themes and string delimiters.",
  "sources": "Class variables and input parameters in methods setting color codes and string delimiters.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, network activity, or external data sources are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence class variables that define terminal color codes; no external flow or data leakage observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; minor coding mistakes such as use of '==' instead of '=' in assignment statements; undefined variable 'page_brackets' in error messages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility classes for terminal styling and string handling, with obfuscated naming conventions. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are evident. Minor bugs are present but are non-malicious. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. The code does not perform any harmful actions or data exfiltration, and its purpose is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for terminal styling and string formatting, with obfuscation likely for stylistic or concealment purposes. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), and the security risk score is low (~0.2).",
