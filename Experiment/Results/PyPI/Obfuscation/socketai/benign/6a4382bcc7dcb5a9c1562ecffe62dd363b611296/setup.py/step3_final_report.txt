{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md for long description, extracts version info from 'menu/menu.py' via regex, and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'menu/menu.py' for data; no untrusted input execution.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, code execution, or network activity.",
  "flows": "Reads files; extracts version string via regex; passes data to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; regex-based version extraction; no code execution; passive file reading.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior. Regex extraction is passive and does not execute code. No network activity or data leaks are present. The only potential concern is if 'menu/menu.py' contains malicious code, but since it is only read and not executed, the risk remains minimal. Malware score is appropriately low; obfuscation is superficial; overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious intent or security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment.",
