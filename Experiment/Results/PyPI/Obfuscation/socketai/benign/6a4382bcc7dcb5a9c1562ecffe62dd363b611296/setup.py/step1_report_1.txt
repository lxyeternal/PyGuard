{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package distribution, reading metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads README.md for long description, reads version from 'menu/menu.py'.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processed in a way that could cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input from files flows into variables for package metadata; no untrusted data flows into executable or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; dynamic regex extraction of version; unconventional variable naming; potential for misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including reading a README and extracting a version string via regex. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious network activity are present. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident; the code does not perform any system modifications, network communications, or other potentially harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected. It appears to be a standard package configuration script without malicious behavior.",
