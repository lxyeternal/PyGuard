{
  "purpose": "To set up a Python package using setuptools, reading version info from a file and specifying dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description, reads 'menu/menu.py' to extract version number.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data is written or transmitted, no execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Reads input files (README.md, menu/menu.py), extracts version info, uses that in setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a regex to extract version from 'menu/menu.py' is somewhat unusual but not malicious. Variable names are obfuscated and inconsistent, which may suggest code obfuscation or attempt to hinder readability, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script reads static files to gather package metadata, particularly extracting version info using regex. The setup function is used to prepare package installation, with dependencies and metadata specified. No data is transmitted externally, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. Obfuscated variable names could indicate attempts to hide intent, but the actual operations are standard for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package setup script with minor obfuscation in variable naming. No malicious activity, malware, or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
