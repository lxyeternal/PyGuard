  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description, reading 'menu/menu.py' to extract version information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed in a harmful way.",
  "flows": "Reading files -> extracting data (version info) -> passing data to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual. The code reads version info from an external file, which is typical. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. No dynamic code execution, no suspicious network activity, no obfuscation or code that appears designed to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads the README.md for a long description and extracts version info from 'menu/menu.py' using regex. The variable names are intentionally obscure, but the operations are straightforward. There are no signs of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or malicious behaviors. The use of obfuscated variable names might indicate an attempt to hide the intent, but nothing malicious is evident from the logic itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be legitimate package configuration code without any malicious intent.",
