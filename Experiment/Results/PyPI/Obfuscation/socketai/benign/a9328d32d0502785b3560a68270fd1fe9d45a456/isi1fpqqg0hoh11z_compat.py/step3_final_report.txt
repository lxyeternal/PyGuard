  "purpose": "Utility functions for class introspection, including listing class methods.",
  "sources": "inspect.getmembers() with predicate=inspect.isfunction to retrieve class methods.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input class object flows into inspect.getmembers(), which yields method name and function pairs; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no malicious code or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign class introspection using Python's inspect module. It includes trivial functions that return the class or list its methods. No network, file, or system modifications are evident. Obfuscation of names could be an attempt to conceal purpose but does not indicate malicious intent. All evidence points to utility code with no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class introspection utility with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal.",
