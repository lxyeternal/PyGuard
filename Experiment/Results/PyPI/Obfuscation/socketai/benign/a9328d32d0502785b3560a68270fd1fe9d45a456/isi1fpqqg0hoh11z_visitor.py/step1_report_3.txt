{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, the specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly defined; no obvious input functions, environment variable reads, or data-fetching mechanisms are visible.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points such as network transmission, file writing, or execution of system commands are identifiable within the code.",
  "flows": "There are no observable source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly performs local computations or transformations without external data interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code patterns are detected. The code structure is straightforward, with no unusual language features or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python constructs, performing basic data operations without external data input or output. It does not include suspicious behaviors such as network calls, system modifications, or hidden backdoors. There are no indicators of malicious intent or malicious behavior. The absence of external interactions or sensitive data handling reduces the likelihood of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies.",
