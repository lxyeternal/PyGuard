  "purpose": "The code is a benign utility script performing standard data processing without malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads input data, environment variables, or configuration files",
  "sinks": "Outputs processed data or logs; no untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks",
  "flows": "Input sources flow into processing functions, then to output sinks without external or malicious data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no external data exfiltration, no network connections to suspicious domains, and no obfuscated or malicious constructs. The confidence score is high (0.9), and the malware score is zero, consistent with the benign assessment. The security risk is minimal (0.1-0.2), reflecting standard data handling without vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks identified. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
