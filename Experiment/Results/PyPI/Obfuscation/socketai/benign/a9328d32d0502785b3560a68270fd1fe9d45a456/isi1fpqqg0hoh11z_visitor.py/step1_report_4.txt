{
  "purpose": "This code appears to implement a simple utility for processing input data, possibly for performing calculations or data transformations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or standard input streams.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to console, logs, or external systems; writes to files or network sockets.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from sources to processing functions, then to sinks, possibly via intermediate variables or functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No use of obfuscated code or unusual language features. No suspicious network connections or hidden backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input from defined sources, processes data through standard functions, and outputs results. It uses typical Python libraries and constructs. No malicious functions, such as system command execution, network connections to suspicious domains, or data exfiltration mechanisms, are evident. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected. The code structure is straightforward and consistent with benign utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard data processing script with no signs of supply chain sabotage, malware, or security vulnerabilities.",
