  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a Python package for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, file reads, or network requests within the code, though no explicit input sources are visible in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network communications, file writes, or environment variable accesses, especially if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources such as environment variables or files through processing functions to sinks like network or file system, but no explicit source-to-sink flow is observed in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated patterns are present. The code uses standard Python features and libraries. No unusual code structures or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain evident malicious constructs such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No suspicious patterns like dynamic eval, exec with untrusted input, or hidden network activity are detected. The code's structure is straightforward, with no anomalies or obfuscation. Without additional context or hidden mechanisms, there are no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be benign, with standard implementation and no suspicious patterns.",
