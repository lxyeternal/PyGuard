{
  "purpose": "The code defines several custom exception classes related to JMESPath expression parsing and validation errors.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from class constructors, attributes, and parameters related to JMESPath expressions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (expressions, tokens, expected/actual values) into class attributes and __str__ methods for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and variable names, with no clear external data handling or system interaction. The class definitions are complex but appear solely for error reporting. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings besides error messages are found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception classes for handling JMESPath expression errors, with methods to format error messages. The class names and variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but their behavior remains within standard exception handling patterns. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code appears to serve as part of a larger library for parsing or validating JMESPath expressions, focusing solely on error reporting and validation. No external or untrusted data sources, or sinks, are present. The structure does not suggest obfuscation intended for malicious concealment beyond name obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of exception classes for JMESPath parsing errors, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be for code style or obscurity rather than malicious purposes. No malicious or harmful behavior was identified.",
