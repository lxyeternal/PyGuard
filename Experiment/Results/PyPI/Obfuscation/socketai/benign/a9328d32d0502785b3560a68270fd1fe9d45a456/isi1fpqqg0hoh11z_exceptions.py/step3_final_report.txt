  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for JMESPath expression errors, including parsing and validation issues.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to exception constructors, such as expressions, tokens, and positions.",
  "sinks": "String formatting within __str__ methods to generate error messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into formatted error message strings; no external data or network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, but no malicious code, external data handling, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception classes used for error reporting related to JMESPath expressions. Obfuscated naming is present but appears stylistic or generated, not malicious. The string formatting in __str__ methods is standard for error messages. No external data sources, network activity, or code injection is detected. The obfuscation does not impact functionality but may hinder readability. Overall, the code is benign and serves as error handling scaffolding.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception classes for JMESPath validation errors, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation is likely stylistic or due to code generation, not malicious concealment. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score is high but justified, and the overall security risk is low.",
