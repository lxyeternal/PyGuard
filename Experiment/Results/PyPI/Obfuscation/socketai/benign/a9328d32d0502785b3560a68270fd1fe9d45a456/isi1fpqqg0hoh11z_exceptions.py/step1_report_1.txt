{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes related to JMESPath expression parsing and validation, mainly for error handling and messaging.",
  "sources": "Input sources include parameters passed to class constructors, such as expressions, tokens, and expected/actual values.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include string formatting for error messages, but no direct handling of untrusted data that could lead to data leakage or code execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes, and then into string representations (__str__) for error reporting.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and variable names with no clear documentation, which could be a sign of code obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious network activity are present. The use of string formatting for error messages is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions for exception handling, with custom __str__ methods to generate error messages. No external or untrusted data is processed beyond parameter inputs. No signs of malicious logic, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection, are present. The obfuscated naming could hinder readability but does not necessarily imply malicious intent. Overall, this appears to be standard error handling code with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of custom exception classes designed for JMESPath expression validation errors. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscated names could complicate analysis but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code seems safe.",
