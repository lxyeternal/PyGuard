{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes related to parsing and validating JMESPath expressions, with no apparent functionality beyond error reporting.",
  "sources": "No external input sources or data reading functions present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "The classes instantiate and format error messages but do not process or pass untrusted data beyond setting attributes.",
  "anomalies": "All classes primarily handle error messages and contain no suspicious code; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data exfiltration routines are present. The code uses obfuscated class and variable names but this appears to be for obfuscation rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines custom exception classes for JMESPath expression errors, including detailed string representations for error messages. No input reading, network communication, file I/O, or other typical malware behaviors are present. The use of obfuscated class names suggests an attempt to hide intent, but these classes are only for error handling. No malicious or suspicious code activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be part of a larger parsing or validation framework, focusing on error reporting. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks within this fragment. The obfuscated naming seems to be a code obfuscation tactic rather than an indicator of malicious intent.",
