{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling and reporting errors in JMESPath expression parsing and validation.",
  "sources": "Input data is not directly read from untrusted sources within this code. It primarily sets up exception classes and methods for error reporting.",
  "sinks": "Error messages generated via __str__ methods may potentially display expression data, but no data leaks or external data writes are evident.",
  "flows": "Error message construction flows from internal attributes to string output, but no untrusted data is introduced or propagated outside the class context.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected. Class and method names appear auto-generated and generic but are consistent with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines several custom exception classes for JMESPath parsing errors, including detailed error message formatting. It uses class inheritance, string formatting, and attribute setting for error reporting. No input reading, network communication, or data processing is present. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are detected. The naming conventions appear obfuscated or auto-generated but serve purely to structure exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of exception classes for handling JMESPath errors, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It solely focuses on error reporting within a library context.",
