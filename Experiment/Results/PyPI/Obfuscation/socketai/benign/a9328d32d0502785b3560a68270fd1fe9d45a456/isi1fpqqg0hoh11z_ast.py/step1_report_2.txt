  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, but without further context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user inputs, or external files (e.g., via open() or sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication (e.g., requests or socket), file writing, or system commands (e.g., subprocess).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment, files) through processing functions, potentially leading to sinks like network transmission or file modification.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected. No suspicious domain connections or cryptomining code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python libraries for data handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The structure is clear, and no obfuscation or unusual language features are present. Without specific network or system calls, there are no immediate security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate utility script. No security risks are identified at this time.",
