  "flows": "Input data from user or parameters flows into network request functions, which send data over the internet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or hidden backdoors apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code uses standard Python libraries for HTTP requests and data processing. No suspicious or malicious code behavior is observed. It lacks any code that would exfiltrate data, connect to unknown domains, or perform unauthorized actions. The structure and usage are consistent with legitimate data collection scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, implementing standard data fetching or processing routines. No evidence of malicious intent or security risks detected.",
