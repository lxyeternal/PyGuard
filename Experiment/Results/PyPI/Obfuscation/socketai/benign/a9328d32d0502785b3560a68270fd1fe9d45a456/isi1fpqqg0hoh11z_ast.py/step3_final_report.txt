  "flows": "Not applicable (no code provided).",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation, suspicious patterns, lack of concrete malicious indicators, missing code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally align with their observations and scoring. Reports 1, 2, 3, and 5 correctly assign low or zero scores due to absence of code or benign descriptions. Report 4 indicates signs of obfuscation and suspicion, with scores of obfuscated=0.7, malware=0.4, and risk=0.5, which are reasonable but could be slightly conservative. Adjusting the malware score from 0.4 to 0.3 for Report 4 would better reflect suspicion based solely on patterns without confirmed malicious activity. The confidence scores are appropriate, and the reasoning is sound across all reports.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are accurate and consistent with their observations. The only recommended adjustment is lowering Report 4's malware score from 0.4 to 0.3 to better match the evidence level. Overall, the scoring and analysis are appropriate, with no major issues.",
