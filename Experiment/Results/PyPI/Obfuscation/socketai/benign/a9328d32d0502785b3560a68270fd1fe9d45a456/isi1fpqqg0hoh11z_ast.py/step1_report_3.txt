{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some data processing or utility functions, but the exact purpose is unclear without specific context or comments.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input sources such as environment variables, files, or function parameters. Specific source points are not visible due to the lack of code details.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but none are explicitly identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (like input functions or environment variables) to sinks (like network or file operations). The exact source-to-sink paths cannot be determined without more detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are evident from the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks concrete implementation details, making it difficult to identify specific security issues or malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal. Absence of clear network activity, credential handling, or obfuscated code suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, but due to lack of detailed context, a low confidence level is assigned.",
