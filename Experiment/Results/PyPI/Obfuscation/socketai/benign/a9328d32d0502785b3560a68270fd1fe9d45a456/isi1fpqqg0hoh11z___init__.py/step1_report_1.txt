{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide wrapper functions for parsing and evaluating JMESPath expressions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input expressions (parameters) for parsing and evaluation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data output or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "Expression parsing occurs via parser.Parser().parse(expression), which could process untrusted input but does not inherently lead to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "The function SKkzpRZoCpmNBPOvIrbrdFcAYytDKVcD calls parse and then attempts to invoke a method named SKkzpRZoCpmNBPOvIrbrdFcAYytDKVcD on the result, which is unusual since parse() typically returns a parse tree, not an object with such methods. The random naming and unusual chaining suggest obfuscation or incorrect usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from the jmespath library and defines a version string. The compile function straightforwardly parses an expression. The second function, SKkzpRZoCpmNBPOvIrbrdFcAYytDKVcD, parses an expression and then attempts to invoke a method with an identical obscure name on the parse result, which is likely incorrect unless the parse method returns an object with such methods. There are no apparent data leaks, external network calls, or malicious payloads. The code structure and variable names are suspicious, possibly obfuscated, but no malicious behavior is evident. No sensitive data handling or external communication is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple wrapper for JMESPath parsing, but the unusual method call on the parse result suggests either misimplementation or obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks within this code fragment. The code appears benign but may be incomplete or incorrectly implemented.",
