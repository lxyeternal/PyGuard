  "purpose": "Provides functions to parse JMESPath expressions and apply them to data.",
  "sources": "User-defined 'expression' input, data parameter in SKkzpRZoCpmNBPOvIrbrdFcAYytDKVcD function",
  "sinks": "Parsing functions and the SKkzpRZoCpmNBPOvIrbrdFcAYytDKVcD function call, potentially executing or evaluating untrusted expressions",
  "flows": "Expression input -> parser.Parser().parse(expression) -> optional data processing in SKkzpRZoCpmNBPOvIrbrdFcAYytDKVcD",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamically parsed expressions without sanitization; the function SKkzpRZoCpmNBPOvIrbrdFcAYytDKVcD calls parse again and then invokes SKkzpRZoCpmNBPOvIrbrdFcAYytDKVcD on the parsed object, which is unusual and potentially dangerous if the expression is untrusted",
  "analysis": "The code imports parser and Options from jmespath, defines a version string, and two functions: 'compile' which parses an expression, and 'SKkzpRZoCpmNBPOvIrbrdFcAYytDKVcD' which parses an expression and then calls a method on the parsed object. The second function suggests dynamic evaluation of user-provided expressions. There is no sanitization or validation, which could lead to arbitrary code evaluation if the expressions are maliciously crafted. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious imports are present. The code does not perform any network or file operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code facilitates dynamic parsing and evaluation of expressions, which could be risky if used with untrusted input. However, there is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior within this code snippet itself. It appears to be a utility module for handling JMESPath expressions. No malware or obfuscation detected.",
