      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores, with reports 4 and 5 showing moderate suspicion due to dynamic features and obfuscation. The scores are appropriate; however, the malware score for report 4 should be increased from 0.2 to 0.3 to better reflect the potential risk posed by untrusted dynamic code execution. Overall, the supply chain risk remains moderate, primarily influenced by dynamic code features, and no confirmed malicious payloads are present."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, flexible tool framework with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The main concern is the execution of untrusted functions and filesystem interactions, which should be managed with proper sandboxing and validation. The scores across reports are appropriate; a marginal risk increase for untrusted function execution is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious patterns, notably in Report 3, but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The overall threat level is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code features. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, with a slight downward adjustment of malware risk to 0.2 to reflect the absence of confirmed malicious activity."
