  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or interaction, but without seeing the specific code, the exact intent cannot be confirmed.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include input functions (e.g., input(), reading files, environment variables), network requests, or data deserialization points.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file writing, system command execution, or sensitive data handling (e.g., printing secrets, saving credentials).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through variables and functions, potentially involving data transformations or validations.",
  "anomalies": "No explicit anomalies detected due to absence of code; however, common suspicious signs include hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic code execution, which cannot be confirmed without seeing the actual code.",
  "analysis": "Without the specific code content, a detailed analysis is limited. Normally, I would identify all data input points, review how untrusted data is processed, check for dangerous operations like exec or eval, and examine network or file interactions for malicious activity. Since the code is not provided, I cannot pinpoint exact risks or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to definitively identify malicious behavior. No obvious malicious indicators are evident without reviewing actual code. The assessment is based on typical risks and patterns.",
