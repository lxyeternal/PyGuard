{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform data processing and possibly interact with external resources, but the specific intent is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from variables, possibly from function parameters or external input functions.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to output variables, files, or network connections; specific sinks are not explicitly shown but could include file writes or network calls if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and potentially to output sinks or external connections.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are detected. The code does not contain suspicious network addresses or obfuscated patterns. However, the lack of context makes detection of hidden malicious intent difficult.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward processing without complex or unusual constructs. No signs of code injection, suspicious network activity, or embedded malicious code. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. The structure and formatting do not suggest obfuscation or malware. Without external context or dynamic behavior, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the static review, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign data processing script. However, limited context and lack of runtime behavior analysis mean the certainty is moderate.",

  "obfuscated": 0,
