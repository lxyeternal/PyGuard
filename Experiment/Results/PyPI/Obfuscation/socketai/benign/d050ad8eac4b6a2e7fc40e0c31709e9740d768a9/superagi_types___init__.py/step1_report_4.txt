{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that imports standard libraries and performs basic operations. There is no clear indication of malicious intent based on the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, or file system (if any). Since no such input methods are explicitly shown, no specific source is identified.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous or sensitive operations such as network communication, file modification, or execution of untrusted code are evident in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Without explicit input or output operations, there are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not contain obfuscated constructs, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior. All usage appears straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries, performs basic calculations or data processing, and terminates without engaging in network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications. There are no suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious code structures. The lack of external input handling and the use of common constructs suggest benign intent. No anomalies or indicators of malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a simple, straightforward script with no harmful intent.",
