  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing reports for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments utilizing eval(), subprocess calls, hardcoded strings, complex or obfuscated code structures, input data handling points.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic code execution points, subprocess invocations, network connections, data leaks through environment variables or hardcoded credentials.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as user input or environment variables flow into eval(), subprocess, or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval() or exec() with untrusted data, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code segments, dynamic command construction, complex control flows.",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively identify suspicious patterns such as eval() usage, subprocess calls, hardcoded strings, and obfuscation. Reports 1, 2, and 4 find no issues, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores. Reports 3 and 5 note suspicious patterns, with Report 3 indicating dynamic execution and credential-like strings, leading to higher scores. The scores are consistent with the described code behaviors. Overall, the suspicion is moderate, with the highest concern in Report 3. Static analysis suggests most code is benign, but dynamic features warrant caution. The scores are adjusted to reflect these observations, with a conservative approach favoring low malware likelihood but acknowledging obfuscation and dynamic execution risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious patterns, notably in Report 3, but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The overall threat level is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code features. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, with a slight downward adjustment of malware risk to 0.2 to reflect the absence of confirmed malicious activity.",
