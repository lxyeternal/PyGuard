  "conclusion": "The code exhibits some suspicious patterns, notably in Report 3, but lacks definitive malicious payloads. The overall threat level is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code features. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis, with a slight downward adjustment of malware risk to 0.2 to reflect the absence of confirmed malicious activity."
