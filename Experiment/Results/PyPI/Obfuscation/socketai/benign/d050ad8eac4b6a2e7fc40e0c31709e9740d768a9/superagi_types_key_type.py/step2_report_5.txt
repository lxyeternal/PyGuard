  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward Enum class with a method to retrieve enum members based on string input.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are detected.\n- The code performs standard enum operations with input validation.\n- No external data sources, dynamic code execution, or network operations are involved.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code converts input to uppercase, checks membership, and raises exceptions if invalid—this is standard and safe.\n- The __str__ method customizes string output but does not introduce security risks.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are present.\n- No signs of supply chain risks or malicious intent.\n\n**Scores assessment:**\n- Confidence is 1 across all reports, which seems reasonable given the simplicity and safety.\n- Obfuscated score is 0, consistent with the straightforward code.\n- Malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior is detected.\n- Security risk is 0, aligning with the analysis.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign, well-structured, and free of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n**My final assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\nThis review confirms that the code is safe and the reports' evaluations are appropriate.",
