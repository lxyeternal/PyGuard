  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for tool configuration key types with methods to retrieve enum members and convert them to string.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading untrusted input; get_key_type method processes input for enum retrieval.",
  "sinks": "None that directly lead to data leaks or security effects; enum member access is safe.",
  "flows": "Input to get_key_type method flows into enum member retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with three members: STRING, FILE, and INT. The get_key_type method converts input to uppercase and checks if it exists in enum members, returning the corresponding enum if valid, otherwise raising a ValueError. The __str__ method returns the string value of enum members. No external inputs are processed in a risky manner, and no code indicates malicious intent. Usage appears standard for configuration key type management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward enum definition with safe methods for handling configuration key types. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
