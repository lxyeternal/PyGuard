  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for key types with validation and string representation methods.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'store' in get_key_type method",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data is processed in a way that leads to data leaks or security effects",
  "flows": "Input 'store' is converted to uppercase, checked against enum members, and returned or raises an error",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward enum implementation with no suspicious or malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code implements a simple Enum class with a class method for safe retrieval of enum members based on string input, converting input to uppercase for case-insensitive matching. The __str__ method provides a string representation. No external data, network calls, or obfuscation are present. The code performs input validation and raises exceptions on invalid input, which is standard. No signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The code is benign, well-structured, and secure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of an enum with input validation. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior, and the analysis scores are appropriate.",
