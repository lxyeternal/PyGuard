{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration for tool configuration key types and provide a method to retrieve enum members based on string input.",
  "sources": "The method get_key_type reads the 'store' input parameter, which is expected to be a string provided externally.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write to any external resources or perform untrusted output; it only raises an exception if invalid input.",
  "flows": "Input 'store' (string) is converted to uppercase and checked against enum members, returning the corresponding enum or raising an error.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is observed. The code is straightforward and uses standard enum features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with three members: STRING, FILE, and INT. The get_key_type class method converts input to uppercase, checks if it exists among enum members, and returns the matching enum; otherwise, it raises a ValueError. The __str__ method returns the enum's value. There are no signs of malicious intent or suspicious behavior; the code simply provides a utility for enum lookup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for enum management with no signs of malicious or security-compromising behavior. It correctly handles invalid input by raising an exception and does not perform any unsafe operations.",
