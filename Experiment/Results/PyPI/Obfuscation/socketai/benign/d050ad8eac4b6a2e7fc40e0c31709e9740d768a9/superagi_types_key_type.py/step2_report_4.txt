  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines an Enum class `ToolConfigKeyType` with members STRING, FILE, INT.\n- Provides a class method `get_key_type` that takes a string `store`, converts it to uppercase, and returns the matching enum member or raises a ValueError.\n- Implements `__str__` to return the enum's value.\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**\n\n- **Functionality:** The code performs straightforward enum lookups with input validation.\n- **Security:** No dynamic code execution, no network calls, no handling of untrusted data beyond a simple lookup.\n- **Malicious Behavior:** None detected.\n- **Obfuscation:** None.\n- **Hardcoded secrets or secrets leakage:** None.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, standard, and secure.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**\n\n- The reports uniformly describe the code as straightforward, with no suspicious or malicious behavior.\n- They correctly identify the purpose, data flow, and the absence of anomalies.\n- They mention no obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets, and no malicious intent.\n- The reasoning is consistent and accurate.\n\n**No significant logical flaws or mistakes are present in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**\n\n- All reports assign:\n  - `confidence`: 1\n  - `obfuscated`: 0\n  - `malware`: 0\n  - `securityRisk`: 0\n\n- These scores are appropriate given the analysis.\n\n**No adjustments needed.**\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Justification for Risk Scores Higher Than 0.5**\n\n- The highest risk score is 0, indicating no security concern.\n- Since the code is simple, does not process untrusted data insecurely, and does not contain malicious logic, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n\n**Therefore, the scores are reasonable.**\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Malware Score Reflection**\n\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports.\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious code are present.\n\n**This is accurate.**\n\n---\n\n### 6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**\n\n- All reports avoid assumptions and stick to factual analysis.\n- They correctly identify the code as benign.\n\n**No unwarranted assumptions detected.**\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Consistency of Scores with the Report**\n\n- All reports are consistent with each other.\n- The scores align with the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Evaluation & Personal Estimate**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious intent or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Overall, the code is a standard utility with no security concerns.**\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | 0              |\n| Obfuscated        | 0              |\n| Security Risk     | 0              |\n\n**The reports are accurate, and the code is benign.**",
