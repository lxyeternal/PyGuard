{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for tool configuration key types and provides a method to retrieve an enum member based on a string input.",
  "sources": "The class method get_key_type reads the input parameter 'store'.",
  "sinks": "The method returns an enum member or raises an exception; no untrusted data flow beyond this point.",
  "flows": "Input 'store' is transformed to uppercase and checked against enum members, then either returns the enum or raises an error.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The code performs standard enum operations with input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with three members and a class method that converts a string input to uppercase, then verifies if it matches an existing enum member. If it does, it returns the enum; if not, it raises a ValueError. The __str__ method customizes string representation. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network operations, or insecure practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard enum implementation with input validation and no malicious behavior or security risks. It does not process untrusted data in a way that could lead to vulnerabilities, nor does it contain any hidden or suspicious code.",
