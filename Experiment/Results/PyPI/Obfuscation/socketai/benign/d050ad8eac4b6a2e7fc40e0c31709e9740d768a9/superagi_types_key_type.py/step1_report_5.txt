  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class for tool configuration key types with a method to retrieve enum members based on input strings.",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading from external sources).",
  "sinks": "None (no data sinks or output to external systems).",
  "flows": "N/A (no data flow between sources and sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Use of Enum class is standard; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a straightforward Enum class with three members: STRING, FILE, and INT. It includes a class method 'get_key_type' that converts an input string to uppercase and checks for membership, raising an error if invalid. The __str__ method returns the enum's value. There are no external inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors such as code execution, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The code is simple and appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard enumeration implementation with a helper method for retrieval. No malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues are present.",
