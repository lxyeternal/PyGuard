{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for tool configuration key types with a method to retrieve enum members based on string input.",
  "sources": "The method get_key_type reads the input parameter 'store'.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks or points where untrusted data leads to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The flow is from input parameter 'store' to the method's logic, which checks membership in the enum and returns the corresponding enum member.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with three members: STRING, FILE, and INT. The class method get_key_type converts input 'store' to uppercase and checks if it exists among the enum members; if so, it returns the corresponding enum instance, else raises a ValueError. The __str__ method returns the enum's value. The implementation is standard for an Enum with a lookup method. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, standard Enum definition with a lookup method. There are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation.",
