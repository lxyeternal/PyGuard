  "purpose": "Framework for defining, configuring, and executing tools with dynamic schema generation, configuration management, and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Function signatures, filesystem (config.yaml), environment variables, user input, caller inspection via inspect.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem access (open, os.path), dynamic model creation (pydantic.create_model), function execution (_execute, func), reflection (inspect).",
  "flows": "Function signature and args -> schema validation -> filesystem config loading -> dynamic model creation -> function invocation -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of filesystem operations and dynamic execution could be exploited if inputs or environment are malicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a flexible, reflective framework for tool management, with dynamic schema creation and filesystem config loading. It allows execution of user-defined functions, which could be malicious if supplied by an attacker. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary risks involve filesystem access and dynamic code execution, which are inherent to such frameworks but are not malicious per se. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.4) are consistent with the code's behavior. Given the potential for malicious functions to be executed, a slight increase in the overall security risk score for Report 5 to 0.4 is justified, but no actual malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, flexible tool framework with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The main concern is the execution of untrusted functions and filesystem interactions, which should be managed with proper sandboxing and validation. The scores across reports are appropriate; a marginal risk increase for untrusted function execution is recommended.",
