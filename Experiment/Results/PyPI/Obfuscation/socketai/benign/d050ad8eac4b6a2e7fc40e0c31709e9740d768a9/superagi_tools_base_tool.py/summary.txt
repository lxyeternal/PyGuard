  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, flexible tool framework with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The main concern is the execution of untrusted functions and filesystem interactions, which should be managed with proper sandboxing and validation. The scores across reports are appropriate; a marginal risk increase for untrusted function execution is recommended."
