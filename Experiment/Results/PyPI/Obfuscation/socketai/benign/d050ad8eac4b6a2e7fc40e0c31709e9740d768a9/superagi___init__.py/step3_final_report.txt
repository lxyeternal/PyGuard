{
  "purpose": "The code is a benign utility script that reads environment variables and user input, performing standard operations without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input functions, command-line arguments, external files",
  "sinks": "Potential system commands, network connections, file writes (none explicitly shown but possible in context)",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input) flow into processing functions, possibly reaching system or network operations",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical utility functions with straightforward data handling. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present. The environment variables and user inputs are handled normally without unsafe functions like eval or exec. The scores reflect a benign assessment, with low security risk and no malware suspicion. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the minimal but potential data flow. Overall, the assessment is consistent and justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
