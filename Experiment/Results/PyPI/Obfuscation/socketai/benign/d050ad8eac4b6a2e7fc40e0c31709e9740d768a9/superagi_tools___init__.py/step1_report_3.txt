  "purpose": "The code appears to be a basic Python script that performs some data processing and potentially interacts with external systems or inputs.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from user inputs, environment variables, or external files read within the script.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include printed data, file writes, or network requests if present; specific sinks are not explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs), possibly involving external connections or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets are detected. The code structure and variable usage appear standard. There is no evidence of obfuscation or suspicious dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis shows that the script performs typical data processing tasks without suspicious behavior. It does not include any network communications, system modifications, or hidden code that would indicate malware. Usage of libraries and functions is consistent with legitimate purposes. No unusual patterns or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The script seems benign, performing standard data handling tasks without any malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage indications.",
