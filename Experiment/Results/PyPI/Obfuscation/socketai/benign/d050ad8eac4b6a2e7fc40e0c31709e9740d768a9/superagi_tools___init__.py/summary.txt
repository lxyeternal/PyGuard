  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their scores, with reports 4 and 5 showing moderate suspicion due to dynamic features and obfuscation. The scores are appropriate; however, the malware score for report 4 should be increased from 0.2 to 0.3 to better reflect the potential risk posed by untrusted dynamic code execution. Overall, the supply chain risk remains moderate, primarily influenced by dynamic code features, and no confirmed malicious payloads are present."
