  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'kahromcyqyv1j3u1', including reading a README file and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static assignment of dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; setup process is standard and safe.",
  "flows": "Read README.md content, then pass dependencies and description to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears as a random string, which could be a tactic to obscure malicious intent or avoid detection. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup routine: reading a README file and configuring package metadata with dependencies. The use of a suspicious package name may indicate an attempt to hide or obfuscate. The dependencies are standard and do not indicate malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious logic present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an unusual package name. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is found based on this code fragment.",
