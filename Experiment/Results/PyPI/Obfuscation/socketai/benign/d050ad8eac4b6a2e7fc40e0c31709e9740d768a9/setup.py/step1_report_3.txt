  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging a Python project, including reading the README file and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file for long description; static strings for package name, version, and dependencies.",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted input sources; setup parameters are static and predefined.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; setup parameters are hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; straightforward setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' for package setup, reads the README.md file to include a long description, and calls 'setup()' with static parameters including package name, version, and dependencies. All code is standard for Python package setup; no dynamic or untrusted inputs, no obfuscated code, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical Python setup configuration with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
