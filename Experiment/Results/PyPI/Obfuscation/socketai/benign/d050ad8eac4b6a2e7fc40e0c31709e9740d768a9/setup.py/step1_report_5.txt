  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description, static package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no data leakage or external effects identified.",
  "flows": "Read README.md -> use in setup configuration; no user input or external data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears as a randomized or obfuscated string ('kahromcyqyv1j3u1'), which is unusual and could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code found.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup procedure: reads a README file for long description and defines dependencies. The package name is non-descriptive and looks like a randomly generated string, which could be suspicious. No code injection, external network calls, or malicious logic present. No obfuscated code techniques or hidden backdoors detected. Overall, it appears as a typical setup script with an unusual package name that warrants further context but no inherent malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script is generally benign, performing standard package configuration. The unusual package name is suspicious but not malicious in itself. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on this code.",
