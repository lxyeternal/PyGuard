  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines dependencies with fixed versions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no network activity or code execution.",
  "flows": "None; static setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Package name 'kahromcyqyv1j3u1' appears obfuscated or randomly generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The only notable anomaly is the unusual package name, which is obfuscated. No suspicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The high obfuscation score in some reports is justified by the package name, but the code itself remains benign. Malware scores are correctly zero; risk scores are low (~0.1 to 0.4), primarily due to the obfuscated name. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern, with obfuscation being the main point of suspicion but not evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The package is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring but does not constitute a threat. Final scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, securityRisk=0.4.",
