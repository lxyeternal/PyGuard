{
  "purpose": "Builds a Python C extension module named 'cndpolator' using specified source files and numpy include paths.",
  "sources": "Source files 'src/ndpolator.c' and 'src/ndp_types.c' used in the Extension object.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network activity, or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "The setup script defines an extension with sources and compile args; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'cVWRFkodLwyxdGOFwbWgRQuZcMooetVb') and inconsistent formatting; no comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for building a C extension module, with obfuscated variable names that are unusual but not malicious. No malicious payloads, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources are present. The obfuscation may be due to code generation or intentional concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2, obfuscated: 0.3-0.7) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with obfuscation being the primary suspicious feature. Overall, the code appears benign and safe for use.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign build setup for a Python C extension module, with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The obfuscation alone does not constitute a security threat, and the code does not perform any malicious actions.",
