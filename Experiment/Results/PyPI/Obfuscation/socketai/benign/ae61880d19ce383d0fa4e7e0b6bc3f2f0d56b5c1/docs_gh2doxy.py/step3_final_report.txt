  "purpose": "Replace single dollar signs with '@f$', ignoring double dollar signs, as a text processing utility.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a file specified via command-line argument.",
  "sinks": "Outputs the processed text to stdout.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> applies regex substitution -> prints result.",
  "anomalies": "None observed; straightforward regex usage; no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple regex substitution to replace dollar signs not preceded or followed by another dollar sign. It reads input from a user-specified file and outputs the modified content. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present. The regex is safe and the code is clear. The only minor consideration is that the filename is user-controlled, which could pose filesystem risks in broader contexts, but not within this code snippet. The malware score is correctly 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is minimal (around 0.1) due to user input handling, but overall the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, straightforward string processing utility with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned across reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
