{
  "purpose": "Read a file and replace specific dollar sign patterns with '@f$' using regex substitution.",
  "sources": "The filename is taken from command-line argument 'sys.argv[1]', then the file is opened and read.",
  "sinks": "The read file content is processed and printed; no external sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input: filename from command line -> file read -> regex substitution -> printed output.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script reads a filename argument, opens the file, and performs a regex replacement. The regex replaces dollar signs that are not preceded or followed by another dollar sign with '@f$'. This is a straightforward text processing operation without any malicious intent. The code does not include obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. No external network or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The operation appears benign and intended for text formatting or template processing.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign script for text processing with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
