  "purpose": "Replace single dollar signs with '@f$' in the contents of a file, ignoring dollar signs that are part of '$$' sequences.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from a file specified via command-line argument",
  "sinks": "Outputting processed data to standard output",
  "flows": "File read -> regex substitution -> print output",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code patterns; no obfuscated code; simple string replacement operation",
  "analysis": "The script reads a file specified as a command-line argument. It applies a regex substitution that replaces single dollar signs ('$') with '@f$', but leaves double dollar signs ('$$') unchanged. The substitution uses negative lookbehind and lookahead assertions to ensure only standalone '$' characters are replaced. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code performs a straightforward text replacement operation without any external network activity or hidden mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This script performs a benign string substitution on input file content. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
