  "purpose": "A class managing multidimensional axes and performing interpolation/extrapolation operations using external 'cndpolator' functions, with obfuscated variable names and some inconsistent references.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as axes, query points, and associated data; internal table storage; external 'cndpolator' functions.",
  "sinks": "Data stored in internal tables; calls to external 'cndpolator' functions; no evidence of data leaks or malicious external communication.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into validation, storage, and external function calls; data retrieved from internal tables and passed to 'cndpolator' functions; results returned based on extrapolation method.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names; references to undefined variables like 'extrapolation_method' and 'yxzEbcIzSSEopzXiovFEGtFZGPQBDYaQ'; inconsistent error messages; potential incomplete or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code manages multidimensional data axes, performs interpolation/extrapolation via external 'cndpolator' functions, and includes validation steps. The obfuscated variable names and inconsistent references suggest either obfuscation or incomplete code. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious payloads are evident. The undefined variables and inconsistent error messages point to poor coding practices or obfuscation rather than malicious intent. The external 'cndpolator' functions are assumed to be legitimate numerical routines. Overall, the code appears to be a complex data utility with high obfuscation but no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated numerical utility managing multidimensional interpolation, with no signs of malicious activity. The obfuscation and code inconsistencies are likely stylistic or due to obfuscation rather than malicious sabotage. The malware score should remain at 0, with a high obfuscation score justified, and a low security risk score reflecting the absence of malicious indicators.",
