  "purpose": "Import all functions or classes from the local module 'ndpolator' and define a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'ndpolator'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data output points present.",
  "flows": "N/A, as there are no data flows or input/output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'GTrCfaHQVcQKSzdnRWWdhrkfiPDRyCrS' suggests obfuscation or concealment, and the import uses a wildcard which can obscure imported content. The code is minimal and lacks context or usage, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module named 'ndpolator', which could be benign but also raises concerns about hidden or malicious imports, especially given the obfuscated variable name. The assignment of a version string '1.2.1' is straightforward but isolated. The code contains minimal content, providing no clear purpose or behavior. The obfuscated variable name and wildcard import are common indicators of potential malicious intent or attempts to hide malicious code, although the code itself does not exhibit malicious actions directly.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscated variable naming and broad import, which could be used to conceal malicious behavior. However, no explicit malicious actions are present in this fragment alone. The overall security risk remains moderate pending further context.",
