  "purpose": "Import all contents from the module 'ndpolator' and define a version string.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .ndpolator and the assignment of a version string.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports and sets a variable.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'GTrCfaHQVcQKSzdnRWWdhrkfiPDRyCrS' appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure, which could be suspicious; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module relative to the current package and assigns a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The obfuscated variable name could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but without further context, it is not definitive. Overall, the code is minimal and does not exhibit malicious characteristics on its own.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import and variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident. The obfuscated variable name is suspicious but not necessarily malicious without additional context.",
