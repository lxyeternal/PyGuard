{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from the 'roman_numbers.roman' module, likely for use elsewhere in the program.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the source, pulling potentially obfuscated or obscure identifiers from an external module.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous if the imported names are used insecurely later (e.g., executing untrusted code, using imported data in security-sensitive contexts). No explicit sink in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import source provides data to the namespace; usage of imported identifiers could represent flow, but no such usage is shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear as long, random strings, suggesting possible obfuscation or malicious naming. The imported symbols are unusual and not descriptive, which may be suspicious. The 'rom' import could be harmless or malicious; the lack of usage makes it unclear.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement with several oddly named symbols, which could be an obfuscation tactic to hide malicious intent. No further code is provided, so the actual use of these imports remains unknown. The presence of such obscure names raises suspicion, especially if they are later used in sensitive operations. The lack of usage or context makes it difficult to definitively determine intent, but the suspicious naming pattern warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet alone is not inherently malicious but exhibits signs of obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious behavior. Without additional context, it is prudent to consider this as suspicious and potentially part of a malicious package that tries to conceal its true operations.",
