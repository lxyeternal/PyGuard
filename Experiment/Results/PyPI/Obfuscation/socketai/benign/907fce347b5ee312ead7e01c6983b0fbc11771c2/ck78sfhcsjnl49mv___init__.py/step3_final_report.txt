  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of the obfuscated import statement from 'roman_numbers.roman' in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no additional code or data sources provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported attributes in further code execution, data handling, or network operations (not present in the snippet).",
  "flows": "Importing obfuscated attributes; potential subsequent usage in code (not shown).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated attribute names that are nonsensical, suggesting possible concealment or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a straightforward import statement with obfuscated attribute names. No further code or context is provided, limiting definitive conclusions. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious activity. Scores assigned across reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscation ~0.75, risk ~0.35) are consistent with suspicion based solely on naming. The cautious stance is appropriate; however, without additional context, the risk remains moderate. The obfuscation alone warrants further review, especially regarding how these attributes are used later. The scores could be slightly adjusted downward if considering that obfuscation is not inherently malicious, but current scores are reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement exhibits suspicious obfuscation but lacks evidence of malicious behavior in isolation. The scores reflect moderate suspicion due to obfuscation but do not confirm malware. Further investigation into the package contents and usage context is recommended before drawing definitive conclusions.",
