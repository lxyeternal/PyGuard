  "purpose": "Import specific symbols from the roman_numbers.roman module, possibly for use in further calculations or processing.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the 'roman_numbers.roman' module, specifically importing three long, seemingly random identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or evaluation functions are present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no flows from input sources to sinks within this snippet; the code is limited to imports.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual identifiers with seemingly random or obfuscated names are imported, which could suggest obfuscation or hidden intent. No other suspicious code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement importing three long identifiers and a module name. The identifiers do not correspond to common, meaningful variable names and appear to be obfuscated or auto-generated. No other code or functions are present that could perform malicious actions. Since the imported symbols are not used within this snippet, their purpose remains unclear. The presence of such obscure identifiers could be a sign of attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscation, but no malicious activity is directly observable.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is limited to an import statement with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this limited context. The import could be benign, but the randomness of the identifiers warrants caution if further context shows they are used maliciously elsewhere.",
