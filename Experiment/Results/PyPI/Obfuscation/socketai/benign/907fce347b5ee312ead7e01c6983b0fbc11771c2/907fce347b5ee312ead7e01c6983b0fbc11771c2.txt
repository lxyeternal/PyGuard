      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears to be superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The overall security posture is low risk."

The scores reflect moderate suspicion due to obfuscation but do not confirm malware. Further investigation into the package contents and usage context is recommended before drawing definitive conclusions."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Roman numeral conversion utility with internal validation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation and the main loop bug are likely intentional or accidental obfuscation artifacts rather than malicious. Overall, it is safe but warrants caution due to obfuscation and the suspicious loop."
