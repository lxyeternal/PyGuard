{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'roman_numbers' that reads a README file and configures package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the README.md file at the beginning of the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data is passed to functions that execute or alter system state.",
  "flows": "Reads from the README file (source) and passes the content to the 'long_description' parameter in setup (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names such as 'feRGKjTKpoOUlaIngbWJnujTRqZuQCnP' and 'IcLRBgJjPyvMnZgmvirNQJrMKjoKzcGO', which do not conform to typical coding standards, but these are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and reads the README.md file content into a variable with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name. It then calls setuptools.setup with package metadata, including the read content as the long description. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The obfuscated variable names seem intended to hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names that do not suggest malicious activity. No malicious code or security risks are detected.",
