{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, variable assignments for package description and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "Passing the read content into setuptools.setup() as 'long_description' (though misnamed), no untrusted data flow or external data handling.",
  "flows": "File read from disk -> stored in obfuscated variable -> passed into setup() parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, obfuscated variable names; typos in parameter names ('feRGKjTKpoOUlaIngbWJnujTRqZuQCnP' instead of 'long_description', 'IcLRBgJjPyvMnZgmvirNQJrMKjoKzcGO' possibly instead of 'classifiers').",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup operation, reading a README file and passing its content into setuptools.setup(). The variable names are non-standard and suggest obfuscation or placeholder use, but there is no evidence of malicious code, code injection, network activity, or data leaks. The typos and strange variable names are likely accidental or stylistic, not malicious. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious intent. Obfuscation scores are moderate, reflecting the unusual variable names but not malicious behavior. Security risk scores are low, consistent with the benign nature of the script. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears to be superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The overall security posture is low risk.",
