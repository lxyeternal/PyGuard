{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'roman_numbers' that reads a README file and configures package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file using open() function",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data outputs observed; no network, file, or system modification functions are used",
  "flows": "The file content read from 'README.md' is assigned to a variable but not used in any malicious or suspicious way within this script",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names such as feRGKjTKpoOUlaIngbWJnujTRqZuQCnP and IcLRBgJjPyvMnZgmvirNQJrMKjoKzcGO are non-descriptive, but this alone is not malicious; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup configuration for a Python package. It reads a README file with proper encoding and assigns its contents to a variable, which is then passed as the long_description parameter. No code injection, network activity, or malicious logic is present. Variable names are unconventional but not inherently malicious. The code appears to be a straightforward package setup script without hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a normal setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. No security risks or malware signals are present.",
