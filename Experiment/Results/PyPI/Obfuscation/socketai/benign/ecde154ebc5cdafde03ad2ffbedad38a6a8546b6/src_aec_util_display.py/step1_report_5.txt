{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process and display data in different formats such as tables, CSV, JSON, or dictionaries, based on input data and specified format type.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters: list of dictionaries, iterator, dictionary, or string; also sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "Printing to console, writing CSV/JSON to stdout, or rendering tables via the rich library.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input parameters; depending on type, it is transformed into table, CSV, or JSON format and then outputted via print or rich's console output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed. Use of eval-like dynamic behavior is absent. The code mainly formats and outputs data; no evidence of data exfiltration or system manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes type checks and conditional branches to process different data formats. It leverages third-party libraries like 'rich' for displaying tables and CSV modules for output. The functions transform input data into various representations without executing untrusted code or external commands. No suspicious network activity, reverse shells, or data theft mechanisms are present. The code's structure is typical for data display and does not contain hidden or malicious logic. The only concern could be if the data passed includes sensitive information, but no intentional data leakage or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data formatting and display utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious behaviors. The overall security risk is very low.",
