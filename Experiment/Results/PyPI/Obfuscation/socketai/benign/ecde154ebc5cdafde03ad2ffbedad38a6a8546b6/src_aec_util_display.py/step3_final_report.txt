{
  "purpose": "The code is a data formatting and display utility that processes various data structures (list of dicts, iterator, dict, string) and outputs formatted tables, CSV, JSON, or simple print statements for reporting or visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data provided via function parameters, including lists, iterators, dicts, or strings.",
  "sinks": "Console output, sys.stdout, JSON serialization, CSV writing, and visualization via 'rich' tables.",
  "flows": "Data is read from input parameters, processed into appropriate formats, and directed to output sinks such as console, stdout, or files.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and class names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt at concealment but does not indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or system modifications are present.",
  "analysis": "The code handles multiple data formats securely, utilizing standard libraries for data serialization and visualization. Despite obfuscated naming, the logic is straightforward and focused on data presentation. No network calls, file tampering, or malicious code patterns are detected. The obfuscation appears to be superficial and not indicative of malicious intent. The code does not perform any dangerous operations such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for data visualization and export, with obfuscation in naming but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The supply chain risk is negligible. The malware score should be set to 0, the obfuscation score around 0.2–0.3, and the overall security risk minimal (~0.1).",
