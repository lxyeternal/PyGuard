{
  "purpose": "The code processes various data structures (lists, iterators, dicts) and displays or writes data in table or CSV format, primarily for data presentation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (lists, iterators, dicts, or strings), and in some cases, sys.stdout for output.",
  "sinks": "Printing to sys.stdout, writing CSV via DictWriter, rendering tables with rich library, and dumping JSON data.",
  "flows": "Input data (source) flows through conditional checks and is either printed, written to CSV, displayed as a table, or serialized as JSON, depending on the data type and specified format.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secret keys. The code dynamically handles various data types; no obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution detected. Use of external libraries (rich) appears benign and intended for data display.",
  "analysis": "The script defines enums and functions to convert data structures (list of dicts, iterables) into table or CSV format. It uses type checks to determine output method: console tables, CSV output, JSON serialization, or simple print statements. The code appears designed for data visualization or reporting, with no evidence of malicious behavior. No backdoors, network connections, or data exfiltration methods are present. The use of the rich library is for rendering tables and does not introduce security concerns. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious dynamic code executions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a data processing and presentation utility with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It handles data securely, with no evident supply chain threats or security risks. The overall security risk score is very low.",
