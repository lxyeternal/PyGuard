{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process various data formats (list of dicts, iterator, dict, or string) and display or convert the data into tabular or CSV format, likely for reporting or data visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Data input through function parameters (list, iterator, dict, or str).",
  "sinks": "Console output (print), sys.stdout writing, and potentially network or file writes if used outside this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data is received via function parameters; processed into tables or JSON; then outputted to console or stdout.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network activity or file modifications; the code mainly handles data display and conversion. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed. Use of enum and dynamic handling of data types is standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enum for output formats ('table' and 'csv') and functions to convert data structures into tabular formats or CSV. It handles various input types including list of dicts, iterators, or dicts, and outputs formatted tables using 'rich' library or writes CSV to stdout. No network activity, external file access, or code injection observed. The functions use safe data handling practices. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration. The code mainly focuses on formatting and printing data, which is typical for data visualization tools. Overall, it appears benign with no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data formatting and display utility that processes various data formats for visualization or output. No malicious or sabotage activities are evident. It securely handles data and outputs it appropriately without any suspicious network or system activity.",
