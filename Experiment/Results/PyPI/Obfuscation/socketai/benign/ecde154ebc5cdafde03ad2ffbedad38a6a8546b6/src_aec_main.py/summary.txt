  "conclusion": "The script functions as a legitimate AWS resource management CLI with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation appears to be an artifact of code generation or obfuscation tools rather than malicious concealment. Overall, the security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."
