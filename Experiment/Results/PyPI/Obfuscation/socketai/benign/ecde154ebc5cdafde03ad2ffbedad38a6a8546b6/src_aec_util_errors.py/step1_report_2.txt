{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases related to instance identification.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name' and 'pjMBSWwoSohwufwVGGsuHCCvhkOgtXqB' in the constructor of the derived exception class.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data leaks, external communication, or sensitive information handling is observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate error messages which are passed to the superclass constructor.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are intentionally obfuscated; the logic constructs error messages based on input parameters. The use of variable names like 'clAyoaSefzJtxabvsaZjIJCRIjdMzcUs' appears deliberately obscure but functionally normal. No malicious code such as network access, system modifications, or data exfiltration is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes with the second class customizing error messages based on provided input parameters. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent; they seem to serve as a form of code obfuscation. The logic checks for 'name' and a second parameter, constructing error messages accordingly. The code raises a ValueError if both parameters are missing. No external calls, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors are evident. Overall, the code appears to be a benign, intentionally obfuscated implementation of custom exceptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of custom exception classes with obfuscated variable names, likely intended to make static analysis more difficult. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks. It appears to serve a purely functional purpose related to error handling.",
