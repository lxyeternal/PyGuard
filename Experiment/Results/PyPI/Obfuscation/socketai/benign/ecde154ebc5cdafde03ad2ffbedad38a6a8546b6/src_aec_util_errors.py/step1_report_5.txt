  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases related to instances, likely in a cloud or server context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name' and 'pjMBSWwoSohwufwVGGsuHCCvhkOgtXqB' in the __init__ method.",
  "sinks": "Raising a ValueError and initializing exception classes, which are standard behaviors with no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the error message; no external data or untrusted sources are involved in the flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; no actual malicious or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes, one inheriting from Exception and another extending the first. The constructor in the subclass uses obfuscated variable names and constructs error messages based on input parameters. The logic involves simple string formatting and a basic conditional check, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or other suspicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names could be intended to hinder easy understanding but do not constitute malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malware-like behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a straightforward implementation of custom exception classes with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
