  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to instance identification.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name' and 'pjMBSWwoSohwufwVGGsuHCCvhkOgtXqB' in the constructor of class 'lqaIyolYrbDKNfUOGBeqJnsnolCYaDSB'.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs error messages based on input parameters; no external data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Conditional checks -> Error message construction -> Exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; conditional logic constructs error messages dynamically. No external or suspicious function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, with the subclass generating error messages based on input parameters 'name' and a second parameter with an obfuscated name. The class raises a ValueError if neither parameter is provided. No network operations, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The obfuscated names and dynamic message creation may be intended to hinder straightforward analysis but do not constitute malicious behavior. There is no evidence of backdoors, malware, or security exploits. The code appears to be for exception handling with obfuscation rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is primarily focused on custom exception handling with obfuscated variable and class names. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide intent or for code obfuscation purposes, not malicious activity.",
