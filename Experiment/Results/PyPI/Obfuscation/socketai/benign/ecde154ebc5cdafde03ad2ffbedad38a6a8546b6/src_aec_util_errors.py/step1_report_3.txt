  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases related to instances, possibly in a cloud or resource management context.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name' and 'pjMBSWwoSohwufwVGGsuHCCvhkOgtXqB' in the constructor.",
  "sinks": "Raising ValueError and passing custom messages to Exception super().__init__(). No untrusted data is directed to external systems or files.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate error messages; these messages are passed to the Exception class and do not lead to external effects.",
  "anomalies": "The class names and variable names are obfuscated, which may suggest attempts to hide purpose. The logic within __init__ uses inconsistent variable references (e.g., 'name_match' is used but not defined), which indicates suspicious or poorly written code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, with the subclass constructing error messages based on input parameters. There is no evidence of data leakage, network activity, or system modification. However, the obfuscated naming and undefined variables ('name_match') could be attempts to obscure behavior or introduce bugs. The logic appears benign and standard for custom error handling, with no malicious behavior observed. The code does not perform any external operations or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement custom exceptions with obfuscated class and variable names, possibly to conceal its intent. There are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or malware. The primary concern is the obfuscation and undefined variable, which suggest poor coding practices rather than malicious intent.",
