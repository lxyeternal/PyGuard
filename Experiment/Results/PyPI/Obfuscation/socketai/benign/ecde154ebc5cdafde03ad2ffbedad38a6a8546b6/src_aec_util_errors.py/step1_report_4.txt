  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with message handling based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'name' and 'pjMBSWwoSohwufwVGGsuHCCvhkOgtXqB' in the constructor of class lqaIyolYrbDKNfUOGBeqJnsnolCYaDSB.",
  "sinks": "The exception message construction and the raising of ValueError if required parameters are missing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> message string formatting -> exception raising.",
  "anomalies": "The class and variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, indicating possible code obfuscation. The exception class names are unusual and do not match typical naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, with one subclass that formats messages based on provided parameters. The parameter names and class names are obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to hide intent or functionality. The code does not perform any external data access, network operations, or system modifications. It primarily handles string formatting and exception raising. The presence of obfuscated identifiers and unconventional class names raises suspicion of code obfuscation, but no direct malicious behavior such as data theft, network activity, or backdoors is evident. The code appears to be benign in functionality but intentionally obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated with nonsensical class and variable names, which may be intended to conceal its true purpose. Functionally, it only defines custom exceptions with message formatting. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution, but based solely on the code content, it appears benign.",
