  "purpose": "This source code appears to perform a utility function involving data processing or network communication, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables, configuration files, or function arguments. External modules or APIs may also serve as data sources.",
  "sinks": "Data may be written to files, logs, or sent over network sockets or HTTP requests. Potential data exfiltration points are considered sinks.",
  "flows": "Untrusted or sensitive data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (network, files, logs), possibly passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No unusual obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors detected. Code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code reads input data from standard sources such as environment variables or function parameters. It processes this data with typical Python functions, utilizing standard libraries without suspicious modifications. No code injection, obfuscated constructs, or malicious patterns are identified. The code's purpose seems benign—possibly data handling or network communication—but without specific context, a definitive malicious intent cannot be confirmed. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or privacy violations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a routine data processing or communication module without evident malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious or malicious patterns were identified. However, due to limited context, confidence in this assessment is moderate.",
