{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic operations, possibly for demonstration or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; no user input or external data reading is evident.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are not directed to external systems; no network connections, file writes, or external system interactions are observed.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows, as the code mainly performs internal calculations or displays results.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows the code is simple, with no external data reads, no network or file operations, and no suspicious functions or patterns. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, code injection, or backdoors. The code uses standard language features and libraries, and there are no anomalies indicating obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign, with no malicious or suspicious activities detected.",
