  "purpose": "Retrieve and filter EC2 instances in a specified region, returning a dictionary of instance IDs and their 'Name' tags.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the 'bPDpnrSELTFlgMbGhSkRGLHjzWxYRDbg' parameter, environment via boto3 SDK, and the 'vILcnfgZnFTMTXNpJVSVEWzWfEoEeiuw' filter dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Uses boto3 to describe EC2 instances, which involves network calls; stores instance IDs and tags in a dictionary.",
  "flows": "Input parameter and optional filters -> boto3 'describe_instances' call -> processes reservation and instance data -> stores instance IDs and 'Name' tags -> handles pagination via 'NextToken'.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; the code appears to be standard AWS SDK usage. Variable names are obfuscated, which is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. No code injection or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code functions to fetch EC2 instance information from AWS, with optional filtering based on tags. It employs a loop for pagination, calls 'describe_instances', and extracts instance IDs and 'Name' tags using a utility function. No suspicious network addresses or backdoors are present. Variable names are obfuscated, which could be a red flag, but this alone is not evidence of malicious intent. The code appears to be standard AWS SDK usage with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs legitimate AWS EC2 instance retrieval and filtering. The obfuscation of variable names is unusual but not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of malware, secret leakage, or malicious activity in this snippet. The overall security risk is low.",
