{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves information about AWS EC2 instances, specifically their states and tags, using boto3 SDK.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (instance data and filters), and AWS API responses (describe_instances call).",
  "sinks": "Uses AWS SDK to query AWS resources; no data is directly written to external sinks or transmitted outside the environment.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> AWS API calls -> Processed data in memory -> Return dictionary with instance IDs and tags.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears obfuscated through the use of non-descriptive variable names and function names. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident. No suspicious network activity or data exfiltration observed. No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution. No apparent backdoors or malicious logic. The import of external modules (boto3, util_tags) is typical for AWS SDK interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed to list EC2 instances and their tags with optional filtering. It uses pagination to handle multiple instances and constructs a dictionary mapping instance IDs to their 'Name' tags. No indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden functionality are present. The obfuscation appears to be solely in naming conventions, not in malicious obfuscation techniques. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are visible. The flow follows a standard pattern of querying AWS resources and processing responses.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate AWS resource query to obtain instance IDs and tags without any signs of malicious intent or sabotage. Its obfuscation is superficial and does not conceal malicious activity. Overall, it is a benign utility function for AWS EC2 data retrieval.",
