{
  "purpose": "Retrieve and filter AWS EC2 instance information based on specified criteria, particularly instance state and tags.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (region, filters), AWS API calls (describe_instances), and data from environment/config.",
  "sinks": "AWS API calls, data processing, and potentially storing or returning instance IDs and tags.",
  "flows": "Input parameters → AWS SDK calls (describe_instances) → Data filtering and extraction → Return of instance IDs with tags.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no suspicious external connections; no malicious code patterns found.",
  "analysis": "The code imports AWS SDK and custom modules, then defines functions to query EC2 instances. It dynamically constructs filters from input, handles pagination, and extracts 'InstanceId' and 'Name' tag. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors are evident. Obfuscated naming may hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent. No network connections, file manipulations, or other suspicious activities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate AWS resource querying and filtering, with no indications of malicious activity or sabotage. Its obfuscated variable names may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the functionality appears normal and benign.",
