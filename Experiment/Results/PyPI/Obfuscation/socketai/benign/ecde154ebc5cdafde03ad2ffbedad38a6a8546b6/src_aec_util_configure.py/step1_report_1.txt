{
  "purpose": "The code appears to copy configuration files from a package resource directory ('aec.config-example') into a user directory ('~/.aec/').",
  "sources": "The code reads resources from 'aec.config-example' using importlib_resources' 'files' and 'iterdir()' methods.",
  "sinks": "The code writes files to the user's home directory (~/.aec/), and uses 'shutil.copy' to copy resource files.",
  "flows": "Resources are read from the package's 'aec.config-example' directory and then copied to the user's ~/.aec/ directory, with checks to avoid overwriting existing files.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious; it uses non-standard function and variable names; no hardcoded secrets or sensitive data are present; the resource copying pattern is typical for configuration setup.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes by creating a directory in the user's home (~/.aec/). It then iterates over resource files within 'aec.config-example', skipping files starting with '__'. For each file, it checks if it already exists in the destination; if not, it copies the file over, creating necessary directories. No external network activity, no handling of untrusted input, and no suspicious commands are present. The obfuscated names are a concern but do not imply malicious intent. The code performs a straightforward resource deployment operation, which is common in setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code simply copies configuration resources into a user directory, which is typical for application setup. The obfuscated variable and function names are suspicious but not inherently malicious. Overall, the script appears benign and intended for configuration management.",
