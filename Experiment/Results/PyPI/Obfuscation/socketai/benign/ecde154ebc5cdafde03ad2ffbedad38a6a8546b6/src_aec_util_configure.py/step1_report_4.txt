{
  "purpose": "The code copies resources from the 'aec.config-example' package directory to a user-specific configuration directory in the home folder.",
  "sources": "resources.files('aec.config-example') which reads files from the package resources.",
  "sinks": "shutil.copy() which writes files to the user's filesystem.",
  "flows": "resources.files() -> copy() -> shutil.copy() to the destination directory.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic path construction, and copying of package resources to user directories without validation. No clear validation or checks for malicious content. Possible risk if package resources are malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a directory in the user's home folder (~/.aec/) and copies all files from the package resource 'aec.config-example' into this directory, skipping files starting with '__'. The copy function constructs file paths dynamically and performs file copy operations. There are no hardcoded credentials, network connections, or system commands. The obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hide intent, but functionally it only copies resource files locally. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modification is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard resource deployment process, copying package resources to a user directory. No malicious actions are evident, but the use of obfuscated variable names and lack of validation could be a concern in some contexts. Overall, it appears benign with no malware indications.",
