{
  "purpose": "The code copies the contents of the 'aec.config-example' package resource directory to a local directory in the user's home folder (~/.aec/).",
  "sources": "resources.files('aec.config-example').iterdir() and resources.as_file(res), which read package resources from 'aec.config-example'.",
  "sinks": "shutil.copy(file, dest_dir) which writes files to the local filesystem, and os.makedirs which creates directories.",
  "flows": "Resources are read via importlib_resources, then copied to the local directory, potentially overwriting existing files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded path (~/.aec/), absence of input validation, and no clear user prompt or authorization checks; however, these are common for configuration copying scripts.",
  "analysis": "The script creates a directory in the user's home folder, then copies all files and directories from the package resource 'aec.config-example' into this directory. It skips special files starting with '__'. The copying process is straightforward, with no evident malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or code execution. The code uses importlib_resources to access package data, and shutil to copy files, which are standard practices. There is no hardcoded sensitive credential, no suspicious domain or network activity, and no obfuscated or malicious code segments. The only concern might be unintended overwriting of files or the directory being used in a malicious context, but this code itself does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a configuration resource installer, copying files from a package resource directory to a local directory. There are no signs of malicious behavior or malware within this code. The only minor security consideration is the use of a hardcoded path, but this is typical for configuration setup scripts. Overall, the script appears benign.",
