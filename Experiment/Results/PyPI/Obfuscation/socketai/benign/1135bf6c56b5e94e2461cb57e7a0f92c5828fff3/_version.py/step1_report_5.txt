{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version and version_tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "None; simple variable assignments with no data flow from untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names and assignments that do not seem to serve a clear purpose. No cryptic or obfuscated code beyond variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '1.0.4' to a variable with an unusual name and also assigns a tuple (1, 0, 4) to another variable. Both are typical in defining version info for a package. No external input handling, no data leaks, no code execution, and no suspicious behavior observed. The variable names are unconventional but do not indicate malicious intent or obfuscation; they might be placeholder or obfuscated variable names. Overall, this is standard version declaration code with no malicious or security-related issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version declaration with unconventional variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
