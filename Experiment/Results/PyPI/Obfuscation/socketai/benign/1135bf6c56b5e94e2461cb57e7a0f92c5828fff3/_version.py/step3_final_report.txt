  "purpose": "Assigning version information to variables with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments for version string and tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code or data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward variable assignments for version info, with obfuscated variable names. No input/output, no dynamic code, no external interactions, and no suspicious patterns. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The minimal code is benign and consistent across reports. Malware score is 0; obfuscation is noted but not malicious; security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version declaration with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the code is safe for use.",
