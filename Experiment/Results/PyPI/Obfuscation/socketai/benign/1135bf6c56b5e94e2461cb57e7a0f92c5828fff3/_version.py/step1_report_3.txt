  "purpose": "Assign version string and version tuple variables, likely for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning string and tuple values to variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data leaks, network calls, or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Variables assigned directly from string and tuple literals; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names; no actual malicious code detected. No external inputs or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns hardcoded version information to two variables with unusual variable names that appear obfuscated. No input sources, no sinks, and no data flows from untrusted sources. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code merely sets version-related variables with hardcoded values and does not exhibit malicious behavior. Obfuscated variable names could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious.",
