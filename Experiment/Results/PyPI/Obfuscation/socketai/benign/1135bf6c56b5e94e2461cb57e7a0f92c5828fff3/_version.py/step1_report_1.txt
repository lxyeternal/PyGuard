  "flows": "Assignment of string and tuple to variables",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names with no clear purpose, but only variable assignments",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string 'YQXwgmjwwIsLumebKqWhGYxlHGJJuGJa' to a variable, and similarly assigns version info to other variables with obfuscated names. No functions, no data input, no external interactions. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or secret data leaks. The obfuscated variable names appear to serve no functional purpose but are not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code only contains variable assignments with obfuscated variable names, which do not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. There is no evidence of malware or security issues.",
