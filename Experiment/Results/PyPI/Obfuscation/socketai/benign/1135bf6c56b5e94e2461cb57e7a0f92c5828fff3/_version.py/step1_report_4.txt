{
  "purpose": "The code appears to assign version information to variables, possibly for a package or module versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignments of hardcoded version strings and tuples to variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Direct assignment from hardcoded strings/tuples to variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or obfuscated code patterns, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and a version tuple to variables with obfuscated variable names. There are no input operations, no data transmission, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious or suspicious logic present. The variable names do not indicate any malicious intent or obfuscation beyond simple naming, and the code does not perform any actions beyond variable assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and harmless, merely setting version information with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
