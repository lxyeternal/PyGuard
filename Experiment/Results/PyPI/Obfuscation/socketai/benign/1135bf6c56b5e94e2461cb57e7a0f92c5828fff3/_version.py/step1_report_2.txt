  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version and version_tuple variables.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Assignment of obfuscated variable to a standard version string and tuple, with no data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable name (YQXwgmjwwIsLumebKqWhGYxlHGJJuGJa) assigned to a version string, which is unusual and potentially suspicious; standard practice would use clear variable names. No actual malicious behavior detected, but the obfuscation is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '1.0.4' to an obfuscated variable, then assigns the same version string to a clearly named variable. The version_tuple variable is similarly assigned a tuple representing the version. The obfuscated variable name raises concern but does not perform any malicious activity. No input sources, no sinks, no data flows indicating malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward, with the obfuscation being the only unusual aspect.",
  "conclusion": "The code mainly defines version info with obfuscated variable naming, which could be intended to hide intent or simply poor coding style. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation alone warrants cautious review but does not indicate malware.",
