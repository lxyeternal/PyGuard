  "purpose": "Load data from 'data/sample.npy' relative to the script's directory by passing its path to an imported function.",
  "sources": "The code constructs a file path to 'data/sample.npy' based on the script's location.",
  "sinks": "The imported function `fsBJhkkjouYiMpJOOhyJbLYCemNRWWZm` potentially processes the file; without its implementation, potential sinks are unknown, but no direct data leaks or network activity are evident.",
  "flows": "Path construction flows into the function call with the file path as input; the function's behavior determines subsequent flow, which is unknown.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names suggest concealment; no other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a path to 'data/sample.npy' relative to its location and passes it to an imported function. The obfuscated naming raises suspicion but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The scores from reports are consistent: low malware (0 or 0.1), high obfuscation (around 0.75), and low security risk (0.2). Without the implementation of the imported function, definitive conclusions cannot be made, but based on available information, the code appears benign. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple data loader with obfuscated identifiers. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation alone is not sufficient to classify it as malicious, but it warrants further review of the imported function. Overall, the code appears benign with a moderate suspicion level due to obfuscation.",
