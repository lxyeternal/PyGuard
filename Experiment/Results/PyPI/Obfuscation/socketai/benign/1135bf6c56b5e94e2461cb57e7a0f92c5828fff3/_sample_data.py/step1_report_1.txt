  "purpose": "Load and process data from a specific numpy file within the package directory.",
  "sources": "Path construction using __file__ to locate 'sample.npy' within the 'data' subdirectory.",
  "sinks": "Calling fsBJhkkjouYiMpJOOhyJbLYCemNRWWZm with the file path, which likely reads the file.",
  "flows": "Constructs file path -> Passes file path to fsBJhkkjouYiMpJOOhyJbLYCemNRWWZm for data reading.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obscure function name and variable names; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors. No data exfiltration or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that constructs a file path to 'sample.npy' within a 'data' folder relative to the script's location. It then calls an imported function with this path, likely to read or process data. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, credential theft, or backdoors. The code appears to be a straightforward data loader with obfuscated naming, which could be for code concealment but not necessarily malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a data loader with obfuscated identifiers, but it does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The use of obscure names warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent.",
