  "purpose": "Load numpy array data from specified files, stack them, and return the data along with metadata.",
  "sources": "File paths provided as string or list of strings; np.load reads data from these files.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; potential risk if untrusted file paths are provided, leading to file inclusion or resource exhaustion.",
  "flows": "Input file paths -> np.load -> stacking arrays -> return data structure.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; minimal input validation; return of function reference without invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code obfuscates its purpose with nonsensical names but performs a straightforward task of loading and stacking numpy arrays from files. It only checks filename extension, lacking exception handling or validation, which could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No network activity or code execution is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The loading of files and data stacking are typical operations, with no signs of sabotage or malware. The return of a function reference in the first function is unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code's main risk lies in obfuscation and lack of validation, not active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a data loader with obfuscated identifiers, no evidence of malicious activity, but its obfuscation and minimal validation pose potential security risks if used with untrusted inputs. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
