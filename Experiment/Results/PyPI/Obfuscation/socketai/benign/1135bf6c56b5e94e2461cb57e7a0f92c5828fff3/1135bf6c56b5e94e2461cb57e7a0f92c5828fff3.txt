The obfuscation is a stylistic or protective measure, not an indicator of malicious activity. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is effectively zero."

The obfuscation level is high but superficial, serving likely to protect intellectual property rather than conceal malicious intent. The security risk score should remain low, and malware score should be zero."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple data loader with obfuscated identifiers. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation alone is not sufficient to classify it as malicious, but it warrants further review of the imported function. Overall, the code appears benign with a moderate suspicion level due to obfuscation."

Adjusting report 5's malware score upward and maintaining cautious scores for obfuscation is recommended. The overall threat level remains low to moderate."
