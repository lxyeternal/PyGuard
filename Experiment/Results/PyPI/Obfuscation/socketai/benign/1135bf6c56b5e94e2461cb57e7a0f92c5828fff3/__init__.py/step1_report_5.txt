{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports version information, data readers, widgets, and sample data for a larger application, likely related to image segmentation or data visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: _version, _reader, _widget, _sample_data.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the code only imports and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling are evident; imports are static and controlled.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors observed. Import statements are straightforward. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated but not suspicious in themselves.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version info, functions, and data from internal modules, with a fallback for version info if ImportError occurs. All imported identifiers seem related to data processing or UI components. The __all__ list defines public API entries. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns are present. Variable names appear deliberately obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The structure follows typical Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup for an application, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It simply manages imports and exposes an API surface.",
