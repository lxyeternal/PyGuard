  "purpose": "Import version information and modules related to reading data, widgets, and sample data for a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: _version, _reader, _widget, _sample_data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data or external network interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "Unusually obfuscated variable names (e.g., YQXwgmjwwIsLumebKqWhGYxlHGJJuGJa), but this is likely for name mangling or obfuscation purposes rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import version information and various functions or data from local modules. It employs a try-except block for version import, which is a common pattern. Variable names are intentionally obscure, possibly for obfuscation or namespace protection, but they do not indicate malicious behavior. The __all__ list suggests the module is designed to expose specific functions or data, consistent with typical package structures. There is no evidence of malicious code, such as network communication, file system manipulation, or hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module import pattern with obfuscated variable names, which could be a stylistic choice or simple obfuscation. There is no malicious behavior or security risks evident in this fragment.",
