  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing, possibly involving network communication or handling user input, but the exact purpose cannot be determined definitively due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Reads data from user input, environment variables, or network responses; possibly from files or APIs.",
  "sinks": "Data could be sent over network sockets, written to files, or used in system commands or database queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, network) to sinks (network transmission, file writing, system commands).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or backdoors detected. Some code structures suggest dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns, but this is not conclusive. No clear malicious behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for typical malware indicators such as network exfiltration, hidden backdoors, or suspicious data handling. It utilizes standard Python features and third-party libraries without unusual or obfuscated code constructs. No direct evidence of malicious intent, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads was found. The flow suggests typical data handling, but the lack of context makes some behaviors ambiguous.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activities detected. However, the absence of complete context limits absolute certainty.",
