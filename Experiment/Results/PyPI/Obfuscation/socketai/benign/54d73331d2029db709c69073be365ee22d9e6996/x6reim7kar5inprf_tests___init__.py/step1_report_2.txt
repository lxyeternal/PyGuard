{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple utility for demonstrating or performing basic data processing, without any explicit malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from user input via 'input()' function or external data files read by open() calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if data from inputs is printed or written to files, but no obvious sensitive data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and may be outputted via print statements or written to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or backdoors detected. No obfuscated or unusual language features. Code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code contains standard input/output operations, basic data processing, and file handling. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or hidden backdoors. Usage of environment variables or insecure practices is absent. The code's structure is clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility with typical input/output operations. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the straightforward nature of the code.",
