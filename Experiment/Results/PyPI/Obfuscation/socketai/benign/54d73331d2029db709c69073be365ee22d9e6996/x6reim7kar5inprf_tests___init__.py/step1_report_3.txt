{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated due to lack of comments or docstrings, but it appears to be a module that handles data processing or computation based on variable manipulations and function definitions.",
  "sources": "Data sources are not explicitly evident; however, potential sources include environment variables, input functions, or external data files if present (not visible in the provided snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network operations, file writes, or system commands, but none are clearly present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code shows variable assignments and function definitions that suggest internal data flow, but no explicit source-to-sink data flow is identifiable from the provided content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code does not contain obfuscated or intentionally misleading constructs. No hidden backdoors or malicious behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet appears to be a straightforward Python module with standard functions and variable assignments. There are no signs of malicious intent such as network communications, data exfiltration, or privilege escalation. The absence of comments or explicit data inputs limits full context, but based on the visible code, it seems benign. No suspicious code patterns or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal, benign Python module without malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is low, and no malware signals are present based on the provided snippet.",
