{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and lookup functions for US states and territories, with environment-based conditional inclusion, primarily for geographic data management.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'DC_STATEHOOD', hardcoded state data, regex patterns for classification.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network, or file operations; internal data handling only.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded into objects, cached, and retrieved via lookup functions; URL joins are used within a method for data retrieval, not external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through nonsensical variable and attribute names; URL construction within a method that is unrelated to core data logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static data repository for US states and territories, with functions for lookup and conditional inclusion based on an environment variable. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. Obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal variable names rather than malicious intent. URL joins are with static URLs and used within a method unrelated to external data transfer. The environment variable influences data inclusion benignly. No signs of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated geographic data module with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. Obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The static data and environment variable usage are benign, and no external effects are observed.",
