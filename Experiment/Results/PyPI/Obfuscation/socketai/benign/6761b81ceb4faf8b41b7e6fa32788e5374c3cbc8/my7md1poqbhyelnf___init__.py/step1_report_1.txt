{
  "purpose": "The code imports various constants and modules related to states and territories, and an obfuscated version string, likely for internal use or version tracking.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .states, .unitedstatesofamerica, and .version",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; no untrusted input handling or external data transmission present",
  "flows": "Imports do not involve data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; they only load internal constants and modules",
  "anomalies": "The only notable anomaly is the import of 'tCXGeegQzoijJKzgYYVGwQDIgtvxeeLS' as 'version' which appears to be an obfuscated or nonsensical identifier",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward import statements from internal modules. The constants imported are likely predefined data structures. The 'version' import uses an obfuscated name, which could be benign (e.g., to prevent easy identification) or suspicious if used maliciously. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. No sensitive data or credentials are hardcoded. Overall, this code is simple and appears legitimate, with the only minor concern being the obfuscated version name, which is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import setup with a minor obfuscation in the version variable. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
