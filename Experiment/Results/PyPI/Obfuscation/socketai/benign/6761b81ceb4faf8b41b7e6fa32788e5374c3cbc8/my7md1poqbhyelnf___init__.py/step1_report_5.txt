{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import various constants and modules related to geographic states and territories, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements for internal modules: .states, .unitedstatesofamerica, and .version.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data outputs are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in the provided snippet; no source-to-sink data paths are observable.",
  "anomalies": "The import of 'tCXGeegQzoijJKzgYYVGwQDIgtvxeeLS' as 'version' from a version module is unusual due to the seemingly random or obfuscated variable name, which could indicate obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements. The import of local modules is typical for organized codebases. The 'version' import uses an obscure alias name that might suggest obfuscation or attempt to hide the variable's purpose. No dynamic code execution, external network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident. The presence of 'unitedstatesofamerica' module could be legitimate, but the naming and import patterns do not inherently indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code seems benign, though the unusual variable name warrants a note.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import structure with one potentially obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. The import of a version variable with an obscure alias is suspicious but not inherently malicious. Overall, it appears safe.",
