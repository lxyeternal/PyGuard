  "purpose": "Import various state and territory data modules and a version string, likely for use in a larger geographic or administrative project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .states, .unitedstatesofamerica, .version",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data output, network communication, or data processing functions are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports data and a version string",
  "anomalies": "The import of a version with a seemingly random or obfuscated name (tCXGeegQzoijJKzgYYVGwQDIgtvxeeLS) could be unusual but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from local modules, including states, territories, and a version string with an obfuscated name. No data processing, network activity, or code execution occurs. The obfuscated version name may be an internal versioning practice or intentional obfuscation, but it does not indicate malicious intent. There are no suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or potentially malicious code behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard module import section for a geographic or administrative data package. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The only minor anomaly is the obfuscated import name, which does not impact security but is worth noting for clarity.",
