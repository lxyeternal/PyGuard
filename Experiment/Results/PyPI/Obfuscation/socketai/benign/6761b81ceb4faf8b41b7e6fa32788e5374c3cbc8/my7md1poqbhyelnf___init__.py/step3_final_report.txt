{
  "purpose": "The code imports various state-related constants and modules, including an obfuscated version identifier, likely for internal versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: .states, .unitedstatesofamerica, and .version",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "Import statements load static data; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated variable name 'tCXGeegQzoijJKzgYYVGwQDIgtvxeeLS' for version, which appears nonsensical or intentionally obscured",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for constants and modules, with no dynamic or malicious behavior. The obfuscated version variable is unusual but not inherently malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is present. The obfuscation could be for internal versioning or concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores assigned in reports reflect this benign nature, with malware scores at 0 and low security risk scores. The obfuscation is moderate but not suspicious enough to elevate threat levels. Overall, the code is safe, with the only concern being the obfuscated variable name, which is not sufficient to classify as malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static import statements with a minor obfuscation in the version variable. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The existing scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is negligible.",
