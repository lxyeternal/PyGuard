{
  "purpose": "The code consists of unit tests validating the 'us' library data, including state information, time zones, and attributes, with no active external input or data transmission.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'us' library data structures, such as states, territories, and their attributes; no untrusted input sources.",
  "sinks": "Assertions within test functions; network requests are only present in skipped test functions and do not execute during normal runs.",
  "flows": "Data validation assertions; no data flows into external systems or untrusted sinks during execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; presence of network request code in skipped functions, which could be used for malicious purposes if activated.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs data validation on the 'us' library, with obfuscated naming possibly intended to mask intent. Network requests are contained within skipped test functions, preventing active data transmission. No active malicious payloads or backdoors are detected. The obfuscation and hidden network code are suspicious but do not constitute active threats. The code's purpose appears benign, mainly verifying data integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign validation routines with obfuscated naming and inactive network request code. No active malicious activity is evident. The main concerns are the obfuscation and hidden network code, which could pose risks if activated or manipulated. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with a malware score around 0.1, an obfuscation score of approximately 0.6, and a moderate security risk score near 0.3.",
