The existing scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is negligible."

The mismatch in __all__ is likely an oversight or obfuscation artifact, not malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a static version string assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, especially in the absence of other suspicious activity. The current scores are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscated score around 0.6-0.7, and security risk near 0.1. No further action is necessary."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign state/territory lookup CLI tool. While obfuscation and external dependencies are suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity within this code fragment. The main concern is the trustworthiness of the external 'us' module. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscation remains high, and overall risk is low, making this code relatively safe if the external source is verified."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion. However, no definitive malicious activity or sabotage is identified. The scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments to reflect suspicion levels, especially in reports highlighting obfuscation and hardcoded secrets. Continuous monitoring is recommended, but immediate high-risk classification is unwarranted."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign validation routines with obfuscated naming and inactive network request code. No active malicious activity is evident. The main concerns are the obfuscation and hidden network code, which could pose risks if activated or manipulated. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, with a malware score around 0.1, an obfuscation score of approximately 0.6, and a moderate security risk score near 0.3."
