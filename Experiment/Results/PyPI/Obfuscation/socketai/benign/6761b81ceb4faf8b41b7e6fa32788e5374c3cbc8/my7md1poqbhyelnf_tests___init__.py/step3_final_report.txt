  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic execution (eval/exec), complex imports, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation patterns.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables, network connections, or file operations; dynamic code execution paths.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec and hardcoded secrets lead to code execution and potential data exfiltration or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without input validation, obfuscation techniques, hardcoded credentials, complex import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution methods and obfuscation, which are suspicious but lack concrete malicious payloads. The presence of hardcoded credentials and obfuscation increases suspicion. No active malicious activity or sabotage is confirmed. The scores reflect these observations, with higher suspicion in reports mentioning obfuscation and dynamic code. The overall security risk remains low to moderate, justified by the suspicious patterns but no confirmed malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion. However, no definitive malicious activity or sabotage is identified. The scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments to reflect suspicion levels, especially in reports highlighting obfuscation and hardcoded secrets. Continuous monitoring is recommended, but immediate high-risk classification is unwarranted.",
