  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising moderate suspicion. However, no definitive malicious activity or sabotage is identified. The scores are appropriate, with slight adjustments to reflect suspicion levels, especially in reports highlighting obfuscation and hardcoded secrets. Continuous monitoring is recommended, but immediate high-risk classification is unwarranted."
