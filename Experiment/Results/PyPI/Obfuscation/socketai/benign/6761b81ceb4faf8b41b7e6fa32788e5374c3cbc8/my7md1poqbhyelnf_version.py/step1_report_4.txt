{
  "purpose": "Assigns a string value '3.2.0' to a variable, likely indicating a version number.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string to the variable 'tCXGeegQzoijJKzgYYVGwQDIgtvxeeLS'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data output, network operations, or data processing that could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the string assignment, which is stored in a variable; no data flows to any sink or external system.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated and does not relate to common naming conventions; the code is minimal and isolated.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of a single variable assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There are no input sources, no data flows, and no suspicious or malicious operations present. The obfuscated variable name could be an attempt at hiding intent, but with no other code, it remains benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a simple variable assignment with no malicious behavior detected. It appears benign and does not pose security risks.",
