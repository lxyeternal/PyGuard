  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign state/territory lookup CLI tool. While obfuscation and external dependencies are suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity within this code fragment. The main concern is the trustworthiness of the external 'us' module. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscation remains high, and overall risk is low, making this code relatively safe if the external source is verified."
