  "purpose": "A command-line utility for looking up state or territory information based on user input, fetching data from an external 'us' module.",
  "sources": "User input query; external module 'us' via obfuscated attribute/method calls.",
  "sinks": "Standard output (stdout) where data is printed; no network or file sinks present.",
  "flows": "User input -> external module method call -> data processing -> stdout output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated module and variable names; reliance on an external, opaque 'us' library; no hardcoded secrets or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI tool that queries state/territory info from an external 'us' module. The obfuscation of module and variable names raises suspicion but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The data flow is simple, with no network or destructive actions. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration is present. The reliance on an obfuscated external module is a potential supply chain risk, but the code itself appears benign. The low malware score (0.0-0.2) is justified, and the high obfuscation score (~0.75) reflects the suspicious naming. The overall security risk remains low (~0.2), assuming the external module is from a trusted source.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign state/territory lookup CLI tool. While obfuscation and external dependencies are suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity within this code fragment. The main concern is the trustworthiness of the external 'us' module. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscation remains high, and overall risk is low, making this code relatively safe if the external source is verified.",
