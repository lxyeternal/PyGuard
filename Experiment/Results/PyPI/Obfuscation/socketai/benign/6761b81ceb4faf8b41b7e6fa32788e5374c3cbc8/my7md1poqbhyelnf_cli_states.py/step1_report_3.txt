  "purpose": "A command-line utility to look up and display information about U.S. states or territories based on user input.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from command-line arguments via argparse (ZgHUICgjXWWTipxUpPNCDuzGxkBlJwJT.query[0]) and from the us library functions and object attributes.",
  "sinks": "Data is output to stdout via sys.stdout.write; no direct data leaks or network connections are evident. No untrusted data is written to files or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "User input (query) flows through the us library lookup function, which returns an object. The object's attributes are accessed and displayed, with some attributes dynamically retrieved and printed.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable and function names (e.g., zljqVsvxQGHhwzdXmnYoTkTBWkNeSkUB), which is unusual and could suggest an attempt to conceal intent. No hardcoded credentials or obvious malicious code are present. The us library usage appears standard for data retrieval, assuming 'us' is a legitimate package.",
  "analysis": "The script parses a user query, retrieves state or territory info from the 'us' library, and prints formatted details. The obfuscation of variables and functions is unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code. The code operates locally, displaying information from a trusted source without modifying files or system state. The only concern is the obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but no such behavior is apparent in the logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data lookup utility with obfuscated naming, which raises suspicion but shows no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be benign, functioning as intended for local data retrieval and display. No security risks or malware are detected.",
