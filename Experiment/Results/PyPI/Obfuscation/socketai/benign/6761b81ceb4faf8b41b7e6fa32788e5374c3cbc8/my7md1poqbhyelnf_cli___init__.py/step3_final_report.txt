  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "eval/exec functions, environment variables, hardcoded strings, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or eval/exec lead to network/file operations or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation score (0.8), usage of eval/exec, misleading variable names, dynamic code execution, data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with data flowing from environment variables to sinks. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but the obfuscation and eval/exec usage increase suspicion. The scores reflect moderate suspicion, with malware at 0.4 and security risk at 0.65, consistent with the signs of potential malicious activity but lacking definitive evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate obfuscation and dynamic code execution, raising some security concerns but no confirmed malicious activity. The scores are appropriate and justified based on the evidence.",
