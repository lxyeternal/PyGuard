{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility script that retrieves and displays system information, likely for diagnostic or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads system environment variables, system commands (via subprocess), and possibly reads configuration files or user input if present.",
  "sinks": "Data is output to the console or logs; it might send data over the network if network functions are used, or write to files.",
  "flows": "System environment variables or user inputs (sources) are processed and displayed or stored; any network operations could transmit data to external servers.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution detected. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are apparent. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as network exfiltration, system damage, or unauthorized data access.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily gathers system info via standard libraries and outputs it. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data theft, network communication with suspicious domains, or backdoors, are present. No obfuscated code or unusual logic was observed. The code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a benign diagnostic utility with no malicious intent.",
