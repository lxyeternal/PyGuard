  "purpose": "Define static constants related to the United States, including country name, abbreviation, and founding date.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments and import of datetime module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static with no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, mismatch between __all__ list and defined variables, and static data that may be placeholders or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static, benign data to variables with unusual names, imports a standard library, and defines __all__ with identifiers not present in the code. No dynamic execution, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated variable names and __all__ mismatch suggest obfuscation or incomplete code but do not indicate malicious intent. The static date and country info are harmless. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation appears superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The mismatch in __all__ is likely an oversight or obfuscation artifact, not malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern.",
