  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation appears superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The mismatch in __all__ is likely an oversight or obfuscation artifact, not malicious. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern."
