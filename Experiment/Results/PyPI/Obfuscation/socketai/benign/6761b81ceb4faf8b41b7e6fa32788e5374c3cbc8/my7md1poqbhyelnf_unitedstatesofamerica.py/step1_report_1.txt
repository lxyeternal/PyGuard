  "purpose": "Define some variables related to the United States, including country name, abbreviation, and a date.",
  "sources": "Reading hardcoded string variables and importing the datetime module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sensitive sinks; variables are assigned static values.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, backdoors, or hidden functions. The use of '__all__' suggests an intended module interface, but no sensitive data or functions are exposed.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns hardcoded strings to variables representing country name and abbreviation, imports the datetime module, and defines a date object for July 4, 1776. The __all__ list indicates the module exports specific identifiers. There is no dynamic code execution, no external data input, no secrets, and no malicious constructs present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, static module defining some constants related to the United States. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
