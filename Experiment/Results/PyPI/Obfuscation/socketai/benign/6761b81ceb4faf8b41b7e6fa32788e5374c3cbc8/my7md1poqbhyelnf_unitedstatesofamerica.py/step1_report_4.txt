  "purpose": "Defines some string variables related to the United States and sets the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments and import statement.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are assigned static strings and a date.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The import of datetime is standard and used straightforwardly. __all__ exports standard names.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns string literals related to the United States to variables with obfuscated names, imports the datetime module, and defines __all__ to specify exported identifiers. No dynamic execution, user input, or network activity is present. Variable names appear intentionally obfuscated but contain no malicious semantics. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious code are detected. The use of datetime is standard, with no signs of misuse or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a simple module that defines some constants and exports them. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious data flows, or suspicious code behavior.",
