The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purpose. The security and malware scores are appropriately low, and the overall risk is minimal."

The scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is low, obfuscation is high, and overall security risk is minimal. Further investigation of the 'core' module and usage is recommended to clarify intent."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign code sanitization and normalization utility, though its obfuscation and rewriting capabilities pose potential misuse risks. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present in static analysis. The overall security risk is moderate due to the potential for obfuscation to hide malicious modifications, but the current evidence suggests low malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The script functions as a benign Python code formatter or analyzer with obfuscated imports that could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior is present. The overall security risk is low, though caution should be exercised regarding the external 'compactify' dependency."

      "conclusion": "The script is a minimal, obfuscated wrapper around an external function. While obfuscation and reliance on opaque code raise security concerns, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The current scores are appropriate; however, further analysis of the external package is necessary to confirm safety."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions with obfuscated identifiers, possibly part of a testing framework. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify malware classification. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), consistent with the analysis."
