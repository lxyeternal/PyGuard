  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; purely import statements",
  "anomalies": "Importing specific attributes with non-descriptive, obfuscated-looking names; no context provided for these identifiers",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'core' from the current package, and then imports two attributes with obscure, non-descriptive names from that 'core' module. There are no other code statements, data handling, or logic. The use of such cryptic attribute names could suggest an attempt to hide functionality or obfuscate intent, but alone this is not definitive. No suspicious function calls, network activity, or data manipulation is visible. The code appears to be a simple import statement block, potentially part of a larger module.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic import operations with obfuscated attribute names. There is no explicit malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risk evident within this fragment. The only concern is the obscurity of the attribute names, which might be intentional to hide purpose, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
