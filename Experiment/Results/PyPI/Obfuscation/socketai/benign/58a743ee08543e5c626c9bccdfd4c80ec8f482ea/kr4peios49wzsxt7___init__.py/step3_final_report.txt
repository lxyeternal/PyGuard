{
  "purpose": "The code performs relative imports from a local module 'core' and imports two attributes with obfuscated names, likely for internal use or concealment.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local 'core' module, importing attributes TWUxRjMrDaxbjDjrNQrkKTwTCcDWCoEv and nvWOSWLvKaZAJTejZLhLzYvJkzhZVHFz.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; potential concerns if subsequent code uses these attributes maliciously or exfiltrates data, but not evident here.",
  "flows": "Import statements establish source-to-attribute flow; no further data flow or external communication visible.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated attribute names, minimal code structure, no functions or logic, which raises suspicion but is not conclusive.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only local imports with obfuscated attribute names. No malicious activity, data leaks, or network operations are present. Obfuscation suggests suspicion but could be benign. Scores are low for malware (0.2), reflecting no direct malicious behavior, and moderate for obfuscation (around 0.75). Security risk remains low (0.2–0.3). The code warrants further review of the 'core' module and downstream usage but is not malicious in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet shows suspicious obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity. The scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is low, obfuscation is high, and overall security risk is minimal. Further investigation of the 'core' module and usage is recommended to clarify intent.",
