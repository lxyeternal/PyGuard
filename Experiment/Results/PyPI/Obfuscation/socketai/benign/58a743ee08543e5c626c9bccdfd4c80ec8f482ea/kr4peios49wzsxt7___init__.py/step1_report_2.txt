{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from a local core module, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing the local module '.core' and specific obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements establish the flow, but no data processing or untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers 'TWUxRjMrDaxbjDjrNQrkKTwTCcDWCoEv' and 'nvWOSWLvKaZAJTejZLhLzYvJkzhZVHFz' appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which may indicate intentional concealment or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple relative import statements, importing a module named 'core' and specific attributes with obfuscated names. The obfuscated names could suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent or sensitive functionality. No suspicious functions, data handling, or network activity is directly present. The code is minimal and straightforward but the use of obfuscated identifiers warrants further scrutiny for hidden malicious behavior. Since the code only performs imports, it does not execute any risky operations directly.",
  "conclusion": "This code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger package. The use of obfuscated identifiers raises suspicion but does not provide conclusive evidence of malicious activity by itself. It may be benign or intentionally obscured; further context from the 'core' module is needed. Overall, no definitive malicious behavior is apparent, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
