  "purpose": "Import internal modules and specific attributes from the core package",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module directory and imports specific attributes from the core module",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imports data from internal modules; no external data flow or output observed",
  "anomalies": "Imported attribute names appear obfuscated or intentionally unclear, which is suspicious but not conclusive",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module named 'core' and then imports two attributes with seemingly random or obfuscated names from that module. The use of non-descriptive, obfuscated identifiers can be a tactic to hide malicious intent or obscure functionality. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is minimal and mostly standard import statements, but the choice of attribute names warrants suspicion. Since no external data sources, sinks, or execution of malicious functions are present, the likelihood of malicious behavior is low, but the obfuscation raises some concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward imports with obfuscated attribute names, which could be a benign obfuscation tactic or a suspicious attempt to hide functionality. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
