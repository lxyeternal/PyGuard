  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign code sanitization and normalization utility, though its obfuscation and rewriting capabilities pose potential misuse risks. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present in static analysis. The overall security risk is moderate due to the potential for obfuscation to hide malicious modifications, but the current evidence suggests low malicious activity."
