{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a utility for validating, sanitizing, and rewriting Python source code files, primarily to ensure syntax correctness and potentially normalize formatting.",
  "sources": "Reads input code from files, splits into lines, and processes line contents for validation and cleanup.",
  "sinks": "Writes back to the same source files after processing; no external data sinks or network activity are present.",
  "flows": "Source: File read → Syntax validation and regex-based modifications → Source code rewriting and overwriting the original file.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names, layered regex patterns for code cleanup, and code rewriting capabilities that could be exploited for malicious obfuscation or covert modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs syntax validation via ast.parse, uses regex to strip whitespace and delimiters, and rewrites code lines, potentially altering original formatting. Obfuscated variable names and layered regex suggest an intent to hide complexity, but no network activity, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads are evident. The functions are consistent with code normalization tools, and the overall structure does not exhibit malicious behavior. The obfuscation level is high, which could be used to conceal malicious modifications, but static analysis finds no active malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign code sanitization and normalization utility, though its obfuscation and rewriting capabilities pose potential misuse risks. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present in static analysis. The overall security risk is moderate due to the potential for obfuscation to hide malicious modifications, but the current evidence suggests low malicious activity.",
