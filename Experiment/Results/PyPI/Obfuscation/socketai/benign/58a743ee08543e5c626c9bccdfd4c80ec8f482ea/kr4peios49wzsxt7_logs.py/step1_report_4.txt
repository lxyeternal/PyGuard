{
  "purpose": "The code defines a custom logger setup and wrapper functions for logging with dynamic message formatting.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (fmt, *bEApKtbGJNCgfjrvwthQTFznloCkddcn, **kwargs) used for message formatting, and environment variables may influence logging level settings.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs are sent to the console via StreamHandler; no untrusted data directly influences system state beyond logging. No evidence of data leakage or malicious network activity.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (fmt and args) flow into formatted string creation, then into logger methods, which output to the console.",
  "anomalies": "Function names and class names are intentionally obfuscated. The code does not perform any suspicious operations like network connections, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The use of caching for the logger setup is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a logger with a stream handler and a formatter. Wrapper functions are defined for different logging levels, passing formatted messages. The obfuscated naming may suggest an attempt to conceal purpose but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no external inputs from files, network, or environment variables other than standard logging configurations. No backdoors, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate logging utility with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The obfuscation seems intended to conceal the purpose but does not introduce threats.",
