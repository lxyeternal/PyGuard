{
  "purpose": "The code defines a logging setup with dynamic message formatting and functions to retrieve the logger and set its level.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters (format strings, positional and keyword arguments), and from environment variables indirectly through logging configuration.",
  "sinks": "The logger outputs to standard output via StreamHandler; no direct untrusted data sink is evident, but formatted messages could potentially include untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (format string and arguments) flow into the logger's message formatting functions, which then output to the console.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and function names are obfuscated, making code intent unclear. The functions wrap logger calls without obvious malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious network activity are present. The code appears benign and primarily sets up logging.",
  "analysis": "The code creates an obfuscated class for message formatting, a cached function to initialize a logger with console output, and wrapper functions to log messages at various levels. No external data sources, network connections, or suspicious behavior are detected. The obfuscated names could be used to hide malicious intent, but the logic itself is standard logging setup. No malicious payloads or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign logging utility with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks was found. Its obfuscated naming may hinder readability but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
