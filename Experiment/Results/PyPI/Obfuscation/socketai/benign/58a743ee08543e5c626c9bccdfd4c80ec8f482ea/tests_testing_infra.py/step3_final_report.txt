{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for string processing, comparison, and test file discovery, likely used in testing or validation contexts.",
  "sources": "The functions read input strings, environment variables, and filesystem paths for test scripts.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through string normalization and comparison functions; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The function ERYCqrSPGVSqhjIpJcFQBLfhlfYcgEPH references an undefined variable 'source', which would cause a runtime error; variable and function names are heavily obfuscated, raising suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions performing string cleanup, comparison, and test script discovery. The obfuscated naming and the undefined 'source' variable suggest incomplete or intentionally concealed code. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are detected. The obfuscation level is high, but the functions themselves are benign and typical of testing utilities. The undefined variable indicates potential code issues but not malicious intent. The overall behavior aligns with benign utility code, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions with obfuscated identifiers, possibly part of a testing framework. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify malware classification. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), consistent with the analysis.",
