  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility functions with obfuscated identifiers, possibly part of a testing framework. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify malware classification. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), consistent with the analysis."
