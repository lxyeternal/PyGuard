  "conclusion": "The script is a minimal, obfuscated wrapper around an external function. While obfuscation and reliance on opaque code raise security concerns, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The current scores are appropriate; however, further analysis of the external package is necessary to confirm safety."
