  "purpose": "Invoke the main function from the 'compactify' package with command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv[1:].",
  "sinks": "Calls the function 'FXXLTWqojtBrAKtINfnCfqcioCHxXXAy' with input arguments, which could process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "sys.argv[1:] -> FXXLTWqojtBrAKtINfnCfqcioCHxXXAy -> sys.exit()",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'FXXLTWqojtBrAKtINfnCfqcioCHxXXAy' appears obfuscated and is a non-descriptive identifier. The module 'compactify' is imported but details of its behavior are unknown. No explicit data validation or sanitization is visible.",
  "analysis": "The script is minimal, simply passing command-line arguments to an imported function and exiting with its return code. The function name is obfuscated, raising suspicion about its purpose. Without source code for 'FXXLTWqojtBrAKtINfnCfqcioCHxXXAy', it's unclear what operations it performs—potentially malicious or benign. The code's simplicity means it relies entirely on the behavior of the imported function. No obvious malicious actions are visible, but obfuscation and lack of transparency are concerning.",
  "conclusion": "The code's behavior depends entirely on the imported function from 'compactify'. Its obfuscated name suggests potential concealment of malicious behavior, but there is no definitive evidence in this snippet alone. The code could be benign or malicious depending on the implementation of the imported function.",
