  "purpose": "Wrapper script executing an external, obfuscated function with command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "sys.argv[1:] passed directly to the imported function.",
  "sinks": "The external function `FXXLTWqojtBrAKtINfnCfqcioCHxXXAy` may process untrusted input; potential for code execution or malicious behavior within that function.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments flow from `sys.argv[1:]` into the external function, which then determines the process exit code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated function name; reliance on external module with no internal validation or logic; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code acts as a minimal wrapper, depending entirely on an external, obfuscated function. The obfuscation and external dependency are red flags in supply chain security. No direct malicious activity or secrets are visible in this snippet. The risk hinges on the behavior of the imported function, which cannot be assessed here. The obfuscation score is high, and the malware likelihood is low to moderate, reflecting suspicion but no confirmed malicious intent. Further inspection of the `compactify` package and the function's implementation is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a minimal, obfuscated wrapper around an external function. While obfuscation and reliance on opaque code raise security concerns, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The current scores are appropriate; however, further analysis of the external package is necessary to confirm safety.",
