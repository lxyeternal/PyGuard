  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script for configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; contains hardcoded strings outside setup(); no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the suspicious string is not used in any functional flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unexplained string 'LWWafluECYdGwlKIxFjuyyLcIxsGopwT=' outside setup(); malformed last line with 'telegram bot messaging automation'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py with an extraneous, unused string and a malformed line. No active malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The suspicious string appears to be a placeholder or obfuscation artifact, but it is not utilized in any logic. The malformed last line suggests a formatting error rather than malicious intent. The overall structure and content do not indicate supply chain compromise or malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with minor irregularities that are likely accidental or formatting issues. The suspicious string is not used and does not pose an active threat. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The irregular last line should be reviewed for correctness but does not imply malicious intent.",
