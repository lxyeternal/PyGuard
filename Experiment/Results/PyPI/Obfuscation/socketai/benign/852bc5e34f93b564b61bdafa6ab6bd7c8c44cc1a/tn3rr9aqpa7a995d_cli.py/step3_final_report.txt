{
  "purpose": "The code facilitates sending and receiving Telegram messages via command-line inputs, utilizing external functions with obfuscated names, which may conceal malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "User inputs for token, chat ID, message, and message-receive; external functions imported from 'terminalbot.bot'.",
  "sinks": "External functions invoked with user data; potential for data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious messaging depending on external implementation.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments are parsed and passed directly to external functions; message sending or receiving is triggered based on input presence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated function names; lack of input validation or sanitization; reliance on external, opaque modules; handling of sensitive data without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script's structure shows typical command-line parsing and external function calls, but obfuscation and absence of validation raise suspicion. External functions' behaviors are unknown, which could hide malicious payloads such as data exfiltration or remote control. The high obfuscation score (0.8) is justified, and the malware suspicion is moderate (0.5), reflecting potential risk without definitive malicious payloads. The overall security risk is estimated at 0.6, considering the red flags present.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and depends on external modules with unknown behaviors, posing a moderate to high supply chain security risk. While no explicit malicious payloads are visible, the structure suggests potential for malicious activity, warranting further investigation into the external functions and implementing input validation.",
