  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and depends on external modules with unknown behaviors, posing a moderate to high supply chain security risk. While no explicit malicious payloads are visible, the structure suggests potential for malicious activity, warranting further investigation into the external functions and implementing input validation."
