  "purpose": "Import specific components from a local module named 'bot'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a relative module '.bot'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A, as this is only an import statement without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are non-descriptive and appear as random strings, which may suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. No actual code logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module 'bot'. The imported names are complex and appear as nonsensical strings, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious hiding. There are no functions, data handling, or network operations. Without further context, the pattern of import names raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is a straightforward import statement with suspiciously obfuscated or random names, which could be an attempt at hiding malicious components. However, with no additional code, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. Further review of the 'bot' module is recommended.",
