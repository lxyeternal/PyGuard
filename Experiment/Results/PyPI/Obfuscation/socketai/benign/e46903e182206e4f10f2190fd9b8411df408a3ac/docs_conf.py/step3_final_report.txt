  "purpose": "Static configuration for documentation setup, involving reading version info and defining metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'VERSION' file from the filesystem.",
  "sinks": "None; no data transmission or external data processing.",
  "flows": "Reading version data from a local file; no untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious activity or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward filesystem access to read a version string and initializes data structures. No network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution is present. Variable name obfuscation appears superficial and not indicative of malicious intent. The code is static and typical for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration script with no signs of malware or security risks. The obfuscation of variable names is superficial and not malicious. The overall security risk is negligible, and the malware score should be 0.",
