{
  "purpose": "Build script for a Windows-specific Python extension module, configuring compiler args and include directories.",
  "sources": "The code reads source files ('py.Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer.DragDrop.Core.cpp'), SDK include directories via 'get_include_dirs()', and compiler type information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network activity, or data leaks are present; the code is purely build configuration.",
  "flows": "The script sets compiler args based on the compiler type, includes SDK directories, and links libraries, with no runtime data flow or external data sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names, which is unusual for such scripts but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Windows build setup with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or runtime malicious actions are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not proof of malicious intent. The scores from reports align with this assessment, assigning zero malware likelihood and high obfuscation scores. The overall risk remains low, with caution advised due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build script with obfuscated identifiers, likely for concealment or code protection. No evidence of malicious activity is present. The obfuscation warrants further review if used in security-sensitive contexts, but the code itself appears benign.",
