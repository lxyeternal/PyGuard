The obfuscation suggests potential concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants further review if used in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, obfuscated file reader with no evidence of malicious activity. The primary security concern is the lack of input validation, which could allow reading sensitive files if misused. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution. The overall malware score remains 0, with a high obfuscation score (~0.8), and a moderate security risk (~0.4) due to potential misuse."

The current scores are appropriate; no evidence of malicious activity is present. Continued monitoring and review of the module are advised to confirm safety."

While no direct malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and dynamic function call suggest potential concealment. The overall security risk is moderate, and further analysis is advised to confirm safety."
