  "purpose": "The code defines functions to generate ANSI escape sequences for colored terminal output with optional bold styling, and a function to strip ANSI sequences from strings.",
  "sources": "Functions generate styled strings based on input parameters; the stripping function reads strings to remove ANSI sequences.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; the code only manipulates strings internally.",
  "flows": "Styled string functions produce ANSI sequences; the stripping function removes these sequences from strings.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated; no malicious code or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a utility for styling terminal output and sanitizing ANSI sequences. It does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious actions. Obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. The regex correctly removes ANSI sequences. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for terminal styling and sanitization. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. All signals indicate low security risk with no malware detected.",
