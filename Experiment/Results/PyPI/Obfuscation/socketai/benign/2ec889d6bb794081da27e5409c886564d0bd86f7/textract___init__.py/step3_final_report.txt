{
  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated module and assigns a version string, with no additional behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local package, assignment of version string",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external communication present",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated module; assignment of version string; no further data flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module name and variable name; minimal code structure; no malicious actions",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a module with an obfuscated name and assigns a version string. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are evident. The obfuscated naming suggests potential concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores reflect high obfuscation (0.75), very low malware likelihood (0.1), and minimal security risk (0.2). The lack of behavior indicates benign intent, but obfuscation warrants caution. Overall, the code appears benign but should be reviewed in the broader context.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is likely benign, with obfuscation serving as a cautionary signal. No evidence of malicious activity is present, but further review of the larger package or environment is recommended.",
