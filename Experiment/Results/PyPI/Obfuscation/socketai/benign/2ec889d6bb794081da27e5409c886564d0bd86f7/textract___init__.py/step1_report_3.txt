  "purpose": "Import a module from a relative path and define a version string",
  "sources": "Import statement from .parsers",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data or external outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import name 'KyRAaVuQMiNLnCuaHAFuIhQQwVXIgmfx' suggests obfuscation or hidden intent; version string is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module with a highly obfuscated name, which could indicate malicious intent or concealment. The version string is simple and hardcoded. No other suspicious behaviors, network calls, or data leaks are present. The import statement alone does not confirm malicious activity but the obscurity warrants caution. No external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in functionality but the obfuscated import name raises suspicion. No evidence of malicious behavior or malicious payloads is detected based solely on this snippet. The code may be intentionally obfuscated to hide its true purpose, which warrants further review.",
