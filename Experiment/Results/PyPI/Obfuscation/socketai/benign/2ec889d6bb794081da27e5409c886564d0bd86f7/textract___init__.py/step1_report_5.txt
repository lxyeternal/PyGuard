{
  "purpose": "Import a parser module and assign a version string, likely for a library or package initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module; assignment of version string",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is only importing and assigning values",
  "anomalies": "Unusual module name 'KyRAaVuQMiNLnCuaHAFuIhQQwVXIgmfx' with a seemingly random or obfuscated identifier, which could be suspicious; no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of a local parser module with a name that appears obfuscated or randomly generated. It then assigns a version string to a variable. There are no input sources, no data sinks, and no complex control flow. The module name's randomness might be benign or could suggest obfuscation; however, in isolation, this is not inherently malicious. No malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification, are evident. The minimal code indicates a standard import and assignment operation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to perform a basic import and variable assignment with an obfuscated module name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
