  "purpose": "A command-line utility for extracting text from documents with configurable options such as encoding, extension, and extraction method.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, imported modules, and potentially external files via user input.",
  "sinks": "Output files specified by the user, and internal data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Input arguments influence file reading, encoding, and output; data flows through parsing and extraction functions to output.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with meaningless class and variable names, irregular code snippets, undefined variables (e.g., 'paths'), suspicious import statements, and inconsistent inheritance structures.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, with meaningless identifiers and irregular code patterns that suggest an attempt to hide its true intent. It appears to be a CLI tool for text extraction, with no evident network activity, data exfiltration, or destructive system modifications. The obfuscation could be malicious or simply proprietary. No concrete malicious payloads or behaviors are observed, but the irregularities and obfuscation raise suspicion. The code's core functionality aligns with legitimate document processing utilities, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated command-line text extraction utility. No evidence of malicious activity or malware is present based on static analysis. The obfuscation suggests potential concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants further review if used in sensitive environments.",
