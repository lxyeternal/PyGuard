  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated command-line text extraction utility. No evidence of malicious activity or malware is present based on static analysis. The obfuscation suggests potential concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants further review if used in sensitive environments."
