{
  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function 'OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ' from the local 'image' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'image'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; the code only imports a symbol.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads the symbol into the namespace; no data flow to external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name 'OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ' appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated string, which could suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate purpose. The code itself is minimal and does not reveal malicious behavior directly, but the obscure naming warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a single import from a local module. The symbol name is highly unusual, possibly obfuscated. No other code, data processing, or network activity is present. The import might be benign, but the suspiciously random symbol name could be an indicator of malicious obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious code elsewhere. Without additional context, this line alone does not confirm malicious behavior but raises some suspicion due to the name's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a simple import statement with an unusually named symbol, which may indicate obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity within this snippet, but the obfuscated symbol warrants further review of the associated module and overall package context to rule out malicious intent.",
