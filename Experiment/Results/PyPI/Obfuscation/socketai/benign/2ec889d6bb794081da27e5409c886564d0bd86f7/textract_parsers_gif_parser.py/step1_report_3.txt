  "purpose": "Import a class or function named OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ from a local module named image.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a local module 'image', specifically the OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ symbol.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data processing or external communications.",
  "flows": "The imported symbol may be used later in the code, but this fragment does not show data flow. The import itself is a static statement.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious. However, no active malicious behavior is observable in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing a potentially obfuscated symbol from a local module. The symbol name looks intentionally obfuscated or randomly generated. There are no signs of malicious code, external network activity, or unusual behavior within this snippet. The code is minimal and does not perform any actions. Without further context, no malicious activity can be inferred from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with an obfuscated symbol name. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this code snippet. The obfuscated name might be a red flag if part of a larger suspicious pattern, but on its own, it appears benign.",
