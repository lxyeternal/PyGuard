  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the issues, and assess the scores.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports focus on a single line: `from .image import OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ`.\n- The imported symbol name is highly obfuscated or nonsensical across all reports.\n- No other code, data flow, or malicious activity is present in the snippet.\n- The main concern is the obfuscated symbol name, which could suggest malicious intent or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and code presence:\n- The code snippet is confirmed to contain only a single import statement importing a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module `image`.\n- No other code or data flow is present.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No errors or mistakes are evident in the code syntax.\n- The only concern is the obfuscated symbol name, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.0). This is consistent with the code snippet alone, which does not show malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Consistently high (around 0.7-0.8). This is justified given the nonsensical symbol name.\n- **Security risk:** Low (around 0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable for such a minimal import.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is just an import statement with an obfuscated name, the malware score should remain at 0 unless there's evidence of malicious behavior elsewhere.\n- The obfuscated nature raises suspicion but isn't conclusive.\n- The overall risk score should remain low unless further context indicates malicious intent.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- The reports do not mention whether the `image` module is benign or malicious. Without inspecting the `image` module, we cannot confirm if the imported symbol is safe.\n- The obfuscated name could be a red flag, but it could also be a generated or auto-obfuscated symbol name.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** **0.0** — no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.7** — high, justified by the nonsensical symbol name.\n- **Risk score:** **0.2** — low, consistent with minimal code and no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The suspiciousness stems mainly from the obfuscated symbol name. If the rest of the codebase or the `image` module is similarly obfuscated, further review is warranted.\n- The import alone does not indicate malicious intent; it could be part of an obfuscated or auto-generated codebase.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The code is a benign-looking import statement, but the obfuscated symbol warrants further review of the module.\n- Scores are reasonable; no adjustments needed based on this snippet alone.\n- No evidence supports raising the malware score; it should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score remains high due to the naming.\n- The overall security risk remains low.\n\n**Final recommendations:**  \n- Investigate the `image` module to ensure the imported symbol is legitimate.  \n- Consider the broader context of the codebase to determine if obfuscation is justified or malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Work out complete.**",
