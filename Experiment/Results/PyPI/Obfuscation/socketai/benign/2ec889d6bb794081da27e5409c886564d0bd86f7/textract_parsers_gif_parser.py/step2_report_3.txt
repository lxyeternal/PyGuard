  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement importing a symbol named `OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ` from a local module `image`.\n- The symbol name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which raises suspicion but is not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n- No evidence of data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior is present in these snippets.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of active malicious behavior in the provided code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming issues in the code:\n- The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated symbol name is suspicious but not inherently malicious.\n- **No issues are confirmed solely based on this snippet.**\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and cautious, appropriately noting that the obfuscated name could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent but do not claim malicious activity outright.\n- They correctly state that further context is needed to determine maliciousness.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** all reports assign 0, which is reasonable given the minimal code and lack of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 or 0.8 is assigned, reflecting the suspicious naming. This seems appropriate.\n- **Security risk:** low (0.1-0.2), which is consistent with the minimal code snippet.\n\n**Potential adjustment:**\n- Since the code is benign on its own, and no malicious activity is evident, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The obfuscated score could stay high due to the naming, but if the context is known to be safe, perhaps slightly lower (e.g., 0.6) could be justified. However, given the suspicion, the current scores are acceptable.\n\n### Risk scores justification:\n- The risk scores are low (around 0.2), which aligns with the absence of active malicious behavior.\n- No score should be higher than 0.5 unless there's evidence of malicious activity, which there isn't.\n\n### Malware score justification:\n- Since no malicious behavior is detected, malware scores should remain at 0 across all reports.\n\n### Assumptions about vulnerabilities:\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the reports correctly note the obfuscated name as suspicious but do not overstate the risk.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: high obfuscation suspicion but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7–0.8 is reasonable given the name.\n- **Malware score:** 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** around 0.2–0.3, reflecting caution but no confirmed threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of my evaluation:**\n\n| Metric            | Suggested Score | Justification                                               |\n|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.0               | No evidence of malicious activity in the snippet.           |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.7–0.8           | The symbol name is highly obfuscated, raising suspicion.   |\n| Overall Risk      | 0.2–0.3           | Minimal risk based on current information; warrants review. |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code snippet is benign in isolation but contains an obfuscated symbol name that warrants further review of the associated module. The current scores are appropriate, but the malware score should remain at 0 unless additional malicious indicators are found.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nContinue monitoring the broader context of this package and its other components to ensure no malicious behavior exists elsewhere.",
