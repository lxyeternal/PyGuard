  "purpose": "Import a class or object named OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ from a local module named image.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from a local module file named image.py.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks for untrusted data; the code only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present beyond the import statement, which loads a specific class/object into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated identifier, which could be suspicious, but without further context, it may simply be a generated or opaque name.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module, importing an identifier with a complex or obfuscated name. There are no other code elements, no function calls, no data processing, or network operations. The identifier's unusual name could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, but it might also be a legitimate class or variable name. Since this is a minimal import statement, it does not by itself indicate malicious behavior. There is no evidence of data leakage, code injection, or malicious activity in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement importing an entity with an obfuscated or non-descriptive name from a local module. On its own, there is no clear malicious behavior or security risk, although the unusual naming warrants caution if the rest of the code base is similarly obscure.",
