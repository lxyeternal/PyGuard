{
  "purpose": "Import a class or function named OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ from a local module named image.",
  "sources": "The code reads the local module 'image' to import a symbol.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves importing a symbol from a local module, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol has a highly obfuscated or random name, which could be suspicious. However, this alone is not conclusive of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a relative module, with no evidence of dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The unusual name of the imported symbol may suggest obfuscation or code hiding, but with only this single line, it is not possible to determine malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple import statement with an obfuscated symbol name. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this single line. The obfuscated symbol name warrants further review of the 'image' module to ensure no malicious code is present there.",
