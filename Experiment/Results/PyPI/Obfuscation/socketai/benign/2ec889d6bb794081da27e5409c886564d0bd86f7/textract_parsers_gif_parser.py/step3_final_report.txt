{
  "purpose": "The code performs a local import of a symbol with an obfuscated name from the 'image' module, likely for internal use within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module 'image' reading the symbol 'OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "flows": "The flow is limited to importing the symbol; no data flows or external interactions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The symbol name 'OhUWyIABGCVTAZCYDLLPorTBafarDLtZ' is highly obfuscated or nonsensical, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, syntactically correct import statement with an obfuscated symbol name. No malicious behavior or data leaks are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score around 0.75, low security risk) are consistent with the evidence. Further review of the 'image' module is recommended to ensure the symbol does not originate from malicious code. The overall risk remains low, and the code appears benign in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign but contains an obfuscated symbol name that warrants further inspection of the 'image' module. The current scores are appropriate; no evidence of malicious activity is present. Continued monitoring and review of the module are advised to confirm safety.",
