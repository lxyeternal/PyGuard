  "purpose": "Extracts and concatenates all text runs from a PowerPoint presentation",
  "sources": "GUAoEvmMMGIAOhtcqlmRIxGzSsCpPnNB parameter (file path or file-like object)",
  "sinks": "Returns concatenated text; no direct sink leading to data leak or external effect",
  "flows": "Input file path/data -> pptx.Presentation -> parse slides/shapes -> collect text runs -> output string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors detected; straightforward text extraction",
  "analysis": "The code imports a presentation library, opens a presentation file, iterates over all slides and shapes, and extracts text from shapes that have text frames. It collects text runs and joins them into a single string separated by double newlines. There are no external network calls, file manipulations beyond reading, or obfuscated/unsafe code. No suspicious patterns, such as hidden code, data exfiltration, or malicious commands, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard operation of extracting text from a PowerPoint presentation without any malicious intent or security risks. It is a typical utility function with no signs of malicious behavior.",
