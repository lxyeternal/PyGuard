  "purpose": "Extracts all text content from slides in a PowerPoint presentation.",
  "sources": "Reads the presentation file via pptx.Presentation, accesses slides, shapes, paragraphs, and text runs.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or external data leakage observed.",
  "flows": "Input presentation file -> iterate over slides/shapes -> extract text runs -> concatenate text segments.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no malicious code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward extraction of text from PPTX slides, iterating over all relevant components without any malicious operations. Obfuscation is present but superficial, not indicating malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or harmful commands are detected. Malware score is appropriately set to 0, security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), primarily due to obfuscation. The logic is benign, and the obfuscation does not imply malicious behavior but warrants caution for maintainability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign PowerPoint text extractor with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security threats are evident. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
