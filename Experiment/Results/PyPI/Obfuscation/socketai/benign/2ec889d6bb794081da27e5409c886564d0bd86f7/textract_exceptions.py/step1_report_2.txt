{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define custom exception classes related to file handling and command execution, likely used within a larger application or library for processing files and running system commands.",
  "sources": "Reads data from imported parser modules, environment variables via os.path.splitext and os.name, and input parameters such as filenames, commands, and exit codes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs string messages that could be displayed to users, but no direct data leaks or network actions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (file paths, commands, method names) are used to generate messages; no untrusted data is explicitly passed to insecure sinks such as eval, exec, or network calls within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code heavily uses dynamic string formatting, but no evidence of malicious obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution. The classes are mainly for error handling and messaging.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with string representations that generate formatted messages based on input data. It imports a parser module for processing filename extensions, indicating reliance on external components. The use of os.path.splitext and os.name suggests environment awareness but no malicious activity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or command execution beyond standard message formatting is present. The overall structure and logic are consistent with typical error handling mechanisms, with no signs of obfuscation, hidden backdoors, or malware. The only potential concern is the import of a parser module, which should be verified for security, but in this code snippet, it appears as a normal dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of error message classes that handle specific error scenarios related to file processing and command execution. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leaks, or supply chain attacks within this code snippet. It appears to be safe and intended for standard error handling in a larger application.",
