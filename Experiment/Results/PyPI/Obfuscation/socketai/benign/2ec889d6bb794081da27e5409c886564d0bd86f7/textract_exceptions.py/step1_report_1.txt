{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and helper classes for file handling, command execution, and error messaging, likely as part of a larger application dealing with file processing and external commands.",
  "sources": "Imports 'os' module, and reads data from method parameters, class attributes, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses os.path.splitext and os.name for system info; constructs error message strings with formatted data; potentially logs or displays error messages.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and class attributes into string formatting functions and conditional checks based on system state.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Usage of imported modules appears standard; no obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines exception classes with customized string representations that generate user-facing error messages. It imports 'os' for file path manipulations and system checks. No execution of untrusted data, no network activity, no suspicious dynamic code execution. The class 'YWRtYldfJqaKGRDKbSXMoKVQVIbdlWIU' handles command execution errors, providing messages based on command failure, but does not execute commands itself. All functions seem to serve normal error handling purposes. No indicators of malicious intent or data exfiltration. The code appears to be a part of a larger application, providing structured exception messages.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard in nature, implementing error handling and system information retrieval without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or security risks based on current analysis.",
