{
  "purpose": "The code defines several custom exception classes and utility classes for handling file-related errors and command execution errors, likely used in a larger file processing or extraction application.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables (via os.path.splitext, os.name) and imports modules from the same package (parsers). It also reads data through string operations and subprocess command executions (implied by command attribute and exit codes).",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of os.path.splitext and os.name if untrusted file paths or command outputs are used without validation. Error message strings include interpolated variables that could be exploited if misused in broader context. No direct data leaks or network actions are present.",
  "flows": "Input sources include file paths, environment data, and command outputs. These data points are used in exception messages and class attributes, with string formatting that could be manipulated if inputs are untrusted. No evident flow to network or file system modification in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string interpolation in exception messages with variables that may originate from external sources, but here they appear to be controlled. Import from a relative module (.parsers), but no dynamic code execution or obfuscation is present. The code structure is straightforward and not obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises class definitions primarily for error handling related to file processing and command execution. It uses standard modules like os for path and environment info. The class constructors accept parameters possibly derived from untrusted sources, but within this snippet, there is no direct use of untrusted data in risky functions. The string formatting methods could be exploited if misused in broader context, but the code as-is does not perform any network, file modification, or data exfiltration. No signs of malicious code or malware behavior such as backdoors, system compromise, or hidden actions are evident. Overall, the code appears to be a utility component with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of utility classes for error handling related to file and command operations. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this isolated snippet. It operates safely assuming proper usage within a larger application context.",
