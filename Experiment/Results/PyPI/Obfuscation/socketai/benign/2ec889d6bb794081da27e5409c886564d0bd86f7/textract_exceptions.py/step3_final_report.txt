{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and helper classes for error messaging related to file handling, command execution, and system information, primarily for use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input data includes filename strings, command strings, exit codes, and module imports such as '.parsers'.",
  "sinks": "Error message strings formatted with class attributes and parameters; no data leaks or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (e.g., filename, command) into formatted error messages; no external or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behaviors; class and variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent; no obfuscation techniques like encryption or dynamic code execution are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of exception and error message classes with standard string formatting. It imports external modules but does not perform any network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. The use of string formatting with class attributes could pose risks if untrusted data is passed, but within this context, no such data flow is demonstrated. The obfuscated naming is superficial and does not imply malicious behavior. Overall, the code is benign, serving as structured error handling components without any malicious payloads or behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of error handling classes with no malicious intent or activity. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscation is minimal, and overall security risk is low (~0.1-0.2). No modifications are necessary.",
