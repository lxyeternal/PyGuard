  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is composed of custom exception classes primarily used for error messaging related to file handling and command execution.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The code relies on external modules (notably `.parsers`) but appears to use them for standard purposes (e.g., parsing file extensions).\n- String formatting is used extensively for error messages, which could be risky if untrusted data is used externally, but within this snippet, no such data flow is evident.\n- No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious code are visible.\n- The code appears to be part of a larger application, likely a file processing or extraction tool.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports conclude that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any dangerous operations.  \n  **Confirmed:** No malicious issues are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**  \n  The reports correctly identify that the code is mainly for error handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. They mention the reliance on external modules, which is standard.  \n  **No significant errors found.**\n\n- **Scores given to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0 or very low (0.1), which is appropriate given the benign nature.  \n  Security risk scores are also low (~0.1–0.2), consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores (>0.5):**  \n  None of the reports justify higher scores; they correctly assign low risk.  \n  **No change needed.**\n\n- **Malware scores:**  \n  The only mention of obfuscation (0.4) in report 5, but the malware score remains low (0.1), which is appropriate.  \n  The code does not contain malicious payloads or behavior.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on code analysis and potential risks.  \n  **No unwarranted claims.**\n\n- **Consistency of scores:**  \n  The scores align with the code's behavior. No inconsistencies are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The import from `.parsers` could be a concern if the module is malicious, but within this snippet, it appears as a standard dependency.\n- The use of string formatting with class attributes is safe here, assuming controlled input.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nBased on the code and reports, I would assign the following scores:\n\n| Aspect             | Estimated Score | Justification                                                                 |\n|--------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | **0**             | No malicious code, payload, or behavior detected.                          |\n| **Obfuscated**    | **0.2**           | Slight obfuscation in class names, but no malicious intent.                |\n| **Risk**          | **0.1**           | Low risk; error handling code with no security vulnerabilities.            |\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is standard error handling with no signs of malware or malicious intent.\n- The scores in the reports are reasonable and consistent.\n- No modifications to the scores are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current low scores for malware and risk. The code appears safe and benign in the context provided.",
