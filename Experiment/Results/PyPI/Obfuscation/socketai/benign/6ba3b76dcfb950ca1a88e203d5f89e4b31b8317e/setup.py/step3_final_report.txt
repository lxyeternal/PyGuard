  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard minimal setup call",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'setuptools' and immediately calls setup() with no arguments. This pattern is common in minimal setup scripts, especially when configuration is provided via setup.cfg or other files. No suspicious or malicious code, obfuscation, or data leaks are present. The main concern is that setup() can execute arbitrary code if the setup script is malicious, but in this snippet, no such code exists. The malware score is therefore 0, obfuscated score 0, and risk score is very low (0.0-0.1), reflecting the potential risk if the setup script is tampered with outside this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for Python packaging. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The overall security risk is minimal, primarily dependent on external setup scripts, which are outside the scope of this snippet.",
