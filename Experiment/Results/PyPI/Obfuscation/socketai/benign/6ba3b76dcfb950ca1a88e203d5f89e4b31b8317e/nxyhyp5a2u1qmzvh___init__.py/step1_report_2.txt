{
  "purpose": "The functions appear to define and return configuration mappings for Jupyter Notebook extensions, specifically for copying or linking extension directories.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; all data is hardcoded within the functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data flows or could leak; the code does not perform any I/O, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "The functions simply return static data; there are no source-to-sink data flows or untrusted data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, with nonsensical function names and no apparent purpose other than returning static data. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present. The functions do not perform any malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions with obfuscated, non-descriptive names that return static lists of dictionaries. These dictionaries contain directory paths and extension configurations typical of Jupyter Notebook extension setup. No external input is read, no data is transmitted, and there are no side effects or malicious operations. The code appears to be benign configuration code, possibly part of a larger setup or package, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serves as configuration for Jupyter Notebook extensions, and does not contain malware or security risks. The obfuscated function names may indicate automated code generation or obfuscation, but the content itself is harmless.",
