  "purpose": "Configuration snippets for Jupyter notebook and lab extensions, specifying extension paths and requirements.",
  "sources": "Static return statements within functions providing extension paths and configurations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data used solely for configuration purposes.",
  "flows": "Functions return static data; no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or non-descriptive function names; no malicious code or dynamic behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions with obfuscated names returning static configuration data for Jupyter extensions. No external input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The functions serve as configuration data, and their obfuscated names may suggest concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. Malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior is evident. Obfuscation scores are moderate due to nonsensical names but are justified given the static nature. Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign, configuration-only purpose. Overall, the code appears safe and non-malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code for Jupyter extensions with obfuscated function names but no malicious intent or security risks. The scores should be malware 0, obfuscated around 0.5, and security risk around 0.1, aligning with the static, harmless nature of the code.",
