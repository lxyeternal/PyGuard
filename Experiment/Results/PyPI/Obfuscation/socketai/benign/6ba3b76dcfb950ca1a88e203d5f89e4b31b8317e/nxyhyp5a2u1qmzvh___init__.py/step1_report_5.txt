  "purpose": "Define functions that return configuration dictionaries for Jupyter Notebook extensions and their transfer paths.",
  "sources": "Function calls to return hardcoded dictionaries; no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Return statements output static data; no sink for untrusted data or external effects.",
  "flows": "Function invocation -> return hardcoded data; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Functions have obfuscated names, but their content is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions with seemingly obfuscated names returning static dictionaries. These dictionaries specify source and destination paths for Jupyter Notebook extensions. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. The functions appear to serve configuration purposes. There is no evidence of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The obfuscated names are suspicious but do not inherently indicate malicious behavior; they may be used for obfuscation or to hinder easy understanding.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving as configuration for Jupyter extensions with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated function names are unusual but not malicious. No signs of malware or security risks are detected.",
