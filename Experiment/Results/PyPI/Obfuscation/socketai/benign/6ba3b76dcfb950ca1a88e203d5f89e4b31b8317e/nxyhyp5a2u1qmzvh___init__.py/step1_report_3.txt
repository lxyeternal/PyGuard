{
  "purpose": "The functions return mappings for source and destination directories related to Jupyter Notebook extensions, likely for configuration or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "No explicit external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks or untrusted data flows identified; no outputs to external systems or files are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; functions simply return static data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are nonsensical and do not reflect standard naming conventions, which could suggest obfuscation or intentional concealment. No secrets or credentials are hardcoded. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two functions that return static lists of dictionaries, which specify source and destination paths for extensions in a Jupyter Notebook environment. There are no external inputs, no network communications, or dynamic behaviors. The function names do not convey meaningful purpose but are not inherently malicious. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as configuration-like functions to define extension paths for Jupyter Notebook. No malicious intent, malware, or security risks are evident.",
