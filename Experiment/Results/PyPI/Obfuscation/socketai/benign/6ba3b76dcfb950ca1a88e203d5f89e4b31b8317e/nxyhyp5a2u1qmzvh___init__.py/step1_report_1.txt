{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions that return configuration-like data related to Jupyter notebook extensions or lab extensions.",
  "sources": "Functions return static data; no external data sources or user inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; functions return static dictionaries and lists.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are named with seemingly random strings, but the content is benign. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected. No obfuscated or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions with non-descriptive names returning static lists/dictionaries that seem to configure or specify extension paths for Jupyter. There is no evidence of input handling, external network activity, or any suspicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a configuration or setup snippet. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, likely part of a larger configuration or extension setup for Jupyter notebooks. No malicious intent or security concerns are detected based on this snippet.",
