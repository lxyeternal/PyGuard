  "purpose": "Configure airflow_db_logger logging settings with dynamic handlers and formatters, using imported configurations and conditional setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from airflow modules, configuration templates, and external utility functions.",
  "sinks": "Updates to logging configuration object, affecting log handlers, formatters, and logger levels.",
  "flows": "Import modules → deepcopy default config → conditionally set handlers → update config object → return configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, dynamic module imports, no hardcoded secrets or network activity, typical for configuration scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex logging configuration setup for airflow, heavily obfuscated but serving a legitimate purpose. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment rather than malicious intent. The logic involves importing configs, deep copying defaults, setting up handlers conditionally, and returning the configuration object.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate airflow logging configuration script with obfuscation for concealment. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.5), and the security risk score is low (0.2). These scores are consistent with the analysis.",
