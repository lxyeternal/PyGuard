  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code reads a version from a local file and passes it to `setup()`. No suspicious activities or data sinks are identified.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0, Obfuscated=0.8, Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation is high, but the code appears benign. No malicious behavior is evident. The high obfuscation might be an attempt to hide the code's simplicity, but nothing malicious is present.\n- **Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or data leaks.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.6, Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.2) possibly due to obfuscation. Still, no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are consistent; no adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same pattern—reading version info, obfuscated variable names, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.7, Confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; obfuscation remains high. The risk score is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, but notes a probable typo: `'qImLpqTSjhgrtCeRQUHyAoBmyDawKqdw='` used as a keyword argument, which is invalid syntax. Likely an obfuscation or mistake.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.7, Confidence=0.9\n- **Assessment:** The invalid syntax suggests this code wouldn't run as-is, indicating a probable mistake rather than malicious intent. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide the typo or a deliberate obfuscation.\n- **Justification for score:** No malware, no malicious behavior, just a probable coding error or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score is appropriate; no malware concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Similar setup script with obfuscated variable names, but notes a likely syntax error: assigning version info to a parameter with a nonsensical name instead of `version=`.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.1, Obfuscated=0.6, Confidence=0.8\n- **Assessment:** The main issue is a probable typo or obfuscation, not malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusions:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** High, but not necessarily malicious—likely an attempt to conceal code.\n- **Security risk:** Very low, mostly due to obfuscation and potential typos, not malicious intent.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code is a standard, if obfuscated, setup script with no evidence of malware or malicious activity.\n- The apparent syntax errors in some reports suggest either obfuscation or mistakes, not malicious code.\n\n### My personal estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 (consistent with the obfuscated variable names)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (primarily due to obfuscation and potential typos, but not malicious)\n\n**Summary:** The code appears benign. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious, and the potential syntax errors seem accidental or obfuscation rather than malicious intent.",
