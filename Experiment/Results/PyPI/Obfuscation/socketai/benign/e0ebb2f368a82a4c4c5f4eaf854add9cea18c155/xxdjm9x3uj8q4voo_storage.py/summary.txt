  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, heavily obfuscated database utility for airflow logs, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not elevate the security risk. The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk remains low."
