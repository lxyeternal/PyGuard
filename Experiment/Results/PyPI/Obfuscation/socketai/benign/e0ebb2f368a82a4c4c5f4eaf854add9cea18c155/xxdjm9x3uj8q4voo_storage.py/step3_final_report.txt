  "purpose": "Database utility for managing airflow task logs, including querying, filtering, and inserting log records.",
  "sources": "TaskInstance attributes, input parameters, ORM query filters, and log data fields.",
  "sinks": "Database session add/commit/rollback, returning log data, and exception handling.",
  "flows": "Source data from task_instance or parameters flows through ORM filters and insertions into the database, with exception handling managing transaction commits or rollbacks.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class, method, and variable names; superficial obfuscation without malicious code or external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ORM-based database operations for airflow logs, with exception handling for transaction safety. Obfuscation is superficial, likely for concealment, but no malicious payloads, network calls, or data exfiltration are present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic detected. The overall structure indicates legitimate log management functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, heavily obfuscated database utility for airflow logs, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not elevate the security risk. The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk remains low.",
