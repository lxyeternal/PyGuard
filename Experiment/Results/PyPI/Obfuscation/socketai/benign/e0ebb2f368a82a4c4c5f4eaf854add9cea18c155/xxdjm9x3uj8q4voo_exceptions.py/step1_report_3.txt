  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named CcUmSiHLVyMUYMPdddqDuQCljrEzMoma.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class only defines an exception type.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a nonsensical, obfuscated string rather than a meaningful name.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition that inherits from Exception, serving as a custom exception. The class name 'CcUmSiHLVyMUYMPdddqDuQCljrEzMoma' appears to be randomly generated or obfuscated, which is unusual and potentially suspicious. No data input, output, or behavior is implemented. There are no apparent malicious behaviors or malicious code patterns such as network activity, file manipulation, or credential handling. The code's purpose seems limited to defining a custom exception, but the obfuscated class name could be an attempt to hide its intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines an obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual class name may be a sign of obfuscation but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
