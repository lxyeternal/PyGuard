  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition for error handling",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines a class",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be a sign of obfuscation or malicious intent, but might also be simply meaningless naming",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception with an obscure class name. No input, output, or data manipulation present. No external libraries, network calls, or suspicious constructs. The unusual class name could be an attempt to obfuscate or hide malicious intent, but in isolation, it appears as a benign class definition. There is no malicious behavior, payload, or suspicious logic visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition with an obscure name, which alone does not suggest malicious intent or security risk. No evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior is present. The class name's obscurity could be benign or a minor obfuscation tactic, but overall, the code appears safe.",
