  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named CcUmSiHLVyMUYMPdddqDuQCljrEzMoma.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears as a random, nonsensical string, which is unusual and could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no other suspicious behaviors or code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code solely declares a custom exception class with a complex, non-meaningful name. No data handling, external input, or malicious activity is evident. The random class name raises suspicion about obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious code, but as it stands, it is just a class declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet does not contain malicious behavior or security risks by itself. The unusual class name warrants caution, but the code does not exhibit malicious intent or harmful actions. It appears to be an obfuscated or placeholder class declaration.",
