  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition, likely used for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears random and non-descriptive; no other code present. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with a deliberately obfuscated or nonsensical name. There are no data inputs, network connections, or suspicious behaviors. The code structure is minimal and straightforward, typical for a class definition, and does not contain any malicious or malicious-looking patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, harmless class definition with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be either placeholder code or part of a larger codebase where the class is used for exception handling.",
