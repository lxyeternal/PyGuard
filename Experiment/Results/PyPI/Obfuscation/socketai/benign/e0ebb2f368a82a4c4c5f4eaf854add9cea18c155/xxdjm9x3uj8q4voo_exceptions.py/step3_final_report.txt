{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, likely used as a placeholder or for obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Class declaration; no data inputs, outputs, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; the code is a simple class definition with no logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Class name is nonsensical and obfuscated; no additional code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with an obfuscated name. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscation score is high due to the nonsensical name; the security risk score is minimal, reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated exception class with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants cautious scoring but does not elevate the risk significantly.",
