  "sources": "No data input or external data sources used",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output points",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only defines a class",
  "anomalies": "Unusually long and obfuscated class name; no other suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with an obscure and lengthy name. It contains no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. No suspicious patterns or malicious behavior are present. The class is standard Python syntax for custom exceptions, albeit with an unusual name that could be for obfuscation or confusion.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception with no evidence of malicious intent. The unusual name does not indicate malicious behavior but could suggest obfuscation or an attempt to conceal purpose.",
