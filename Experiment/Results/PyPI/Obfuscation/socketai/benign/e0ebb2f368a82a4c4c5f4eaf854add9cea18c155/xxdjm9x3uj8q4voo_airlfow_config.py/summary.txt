  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, configuration utility for Airflow. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation likely serves internal protection rather than malicious purposes. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The obfuscation score is high but justified, and the overall risk remains low."
