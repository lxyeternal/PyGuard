  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup or test script with heavy obfuscation. No evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior is visible. The obfuscation warrants caution, but scores are appropriately low for malware. External modules should be inspected for malicious code before deployment. Overall, the risk is moderate, and further validation is advised."
