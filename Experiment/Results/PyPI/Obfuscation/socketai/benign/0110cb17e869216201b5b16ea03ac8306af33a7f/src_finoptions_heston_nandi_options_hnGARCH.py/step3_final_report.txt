  "purpose": "Statistical/financial modeling, parameter estimation, likelihood calculations, array transformations, and diagnostic reporting.",
  "sources": "Function arguments providing input arrays and parameters, internal variable assignments, and optional print statements for parameter reporting.",
  "sinks": "In-memory computations; no external data transmission or file I/O; optional print statements could leak information if misused.",
  "flows": "Input data is transformed via sigmoid functions; likelihood computed; array elements updated iteratively based on previous values and parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with meaningless class and variable names; superficial complexity without malicious indicators; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate statistical calculations involving sigmoid transformations, likelihood estimation, and array updates. Obfuscation is likely for proprietary reasons, not malicious intent. No external data leaks, network activity, or system modifications are present. The print statements are benign but could leak data if misused. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but they do not imply malicious activity. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation and potential data leakage via print statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, legitimate statistical or financial modeling routine with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and likely for proprietary reasons. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and should be maintained.",
