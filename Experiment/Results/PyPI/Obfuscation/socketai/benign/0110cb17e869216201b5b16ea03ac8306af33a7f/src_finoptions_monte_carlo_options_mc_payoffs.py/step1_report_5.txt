  "purpose": "Define abstract and concrete classes for financial option pricing models, utilizing numpy for numerical computations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in class constructors, class attributes, and methods calling self attributes and numpy functions.",
  "sinks": "Methods performing calculations with numpy; no external data sinks or network operations detected.",
  "flows": "Input data (attributes) flows into methods which perform mathematical calculations using numpy functions like exp, sum, cumsum, maximum, mean.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated class and method names, but no suspicious hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. No evidence of hidden malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines abstract base classes and derived classes for financial computations (likely option pricing). The methods perform standard mathematical operations like exponentials, sums, and maximums, which align with typical financial formulas. Usage of numpy functions appears consistent with normal computational routines. There are no network operations, file manipulations, or suspicious side-effects. The naming is obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of financial models with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The code solely performs numerical calculations related to options pricing, with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious intent.",
