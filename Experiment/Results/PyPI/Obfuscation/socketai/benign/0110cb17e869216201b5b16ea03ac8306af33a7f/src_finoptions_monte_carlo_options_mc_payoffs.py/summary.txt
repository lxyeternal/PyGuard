  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but legitimate implementation of financial options models. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise is found. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or security risk scores. The current scores—malware: 0, obfuscated: approximately 0.75, security risk: approximately 0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
