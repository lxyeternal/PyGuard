  "purpose": "Setup script for the Python package 'finoptions', configuring metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file; static data in setup() parameters including package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or runtime data processing; static configuration only.",
  "flows": "Reads README content -> passes data to setuptools.setup() without dynamic execution or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable names and unusual key-value pairs in setup parameters; no malicious code or dynamic behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which is suspicious but not malicious. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leakage is present. The static analysis shows no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Malware scores are zero, consistent with the absence of malicious actions. Security risk scores are low, reflecting no active threats. The obfuscation score is high due to the variable names, which is justified. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants cautious review due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with suspicious obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute a security threat based on static analysis. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0.75, securityRisk=0.2.",
