  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with suspicious obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute a security threat based on static analysis. Scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0.75, securityRisk=0.2."
