{
  "purpose": "This code defines classes for various financial options, including Black-Scholes, Black76, and Miltersen-Schwartz models, with methods for calculating option prices and Greeks.",
  "sources": "Data is read from class attributes, method parameters, and imported modules. Input parameters such as S, K, t, r, sigma, and various model-specific parameters are sources of data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include calculations involving data transformations, method calls, and possibly network or file I/O if any, but none are explicitly present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into attribute calculations, then into pricing and Greeks methods. No external data sources or sinks are actively used, aside from imported modules.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, obfuscated function names, and complex mathematical expressions suggest code obfuscation or intentional concealment. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are apparent. Usage of decorators with external functions could mask behavior, but the decorator appears to be a placeholder for Greeks calculation. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or file I/O detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for option pricing models with methods for calculating option prices and Greeks. It uses standard numerical methods and mathematical formulas. The obfuscated function and variable names indicate possible effort to conceal intent, but the code performs typical financial calculations without any suspicious I/O or malicious operations. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful behavior was observed. The complexity appears to be for model implementation rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate implementation of financial option models with obfuscated naming conventions. There are no indications of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The complexity and obfuscation could be suspicious but are likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. Overall, the code seems safe, with a low malware likelihood.",
