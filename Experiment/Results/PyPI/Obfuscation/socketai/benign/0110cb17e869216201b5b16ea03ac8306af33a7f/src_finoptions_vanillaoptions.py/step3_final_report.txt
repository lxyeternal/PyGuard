{
  "purpose": "Implementation of financial option models (Black-Scholes, Black 1977, Miltersen-Schwartz) with calculation of Greeks and sensitivities.",
  "sources": "Class attributes (S, K, t, r, b, sigma), imported modules, decorator functions, class initializers, input parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network connections, or file I/O detected; calculations are internal and self-contained.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class attributes, which are used in mathematical formulas for option pricing and Greeks calculations.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy variable and function name obfuscation, use of a decorator with an undefined or external function, complex nested expressions, no clear documentation or comments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes representing different types of options, with methods implementing standard formulas for option valuation and Greeks. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment or proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. No network activity, file operations, or suspicious external communications are present. The decorator applied to certain methods is undefined here, but without evidence of malicious behavior, it likely serves as a wrapper or for logging. The calculations align with known financial models, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of financial option models with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, network communication, or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation seems intended for concealment rather than malicious sabotage.",
