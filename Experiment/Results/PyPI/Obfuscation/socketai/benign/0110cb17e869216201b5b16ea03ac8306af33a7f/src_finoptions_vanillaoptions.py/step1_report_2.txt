{
  "purpose": "Define classes for different types of financial options and their associated Greeks, including methods for valuation and risk sensitivity calculations.",
  "sources": "Input data from constructor parameters, class attributes, and imported modules; data reads include input parameters such as S, K, t, r, sigma, and other financial metrics.",
  "sinks": "Methods performing calculations that may process untrusted or external data, but primarily use internally passed parameters; no explicit data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters to internal calculations within class methods, with some method calls passing parameters and returning computed values, but no external data exfiltration or network activity detected.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains obfuscated variable names (e.g., GLwQkAGCreXRqySaSRLWuDXemLrkZCuz, DDDYWJSqSeqnQWfUDNsMCKReSHvyNnBH), suggesting possible obfuscation or concealment of intent. The code includes dynamic method decorations with potential for dynamic execution, but no explicit code injection or malicious behavior found.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to define financial option classes with standard valuation formulas for Black-Scholes and related options. Variable names are obfuscated, which complicates understanding, but the core computations follow typical formulas. No signs of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. Use of obfuscation and dynamic decorators could be attempts to conceal intent, but based solely on this fragment, it primarily implements financial calculations. No hardcoded credentials, system modifications, or malicious side-effects are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is primarily for financial option valuation and risk metrics with obfuscated variable names and some dynamic method decoration. No malicious activity or sabotage evident. The obfuscation raises concern about intent to conceal, but no direct malicious behavior is identified within this code fragment. Overall security risk is low.",
