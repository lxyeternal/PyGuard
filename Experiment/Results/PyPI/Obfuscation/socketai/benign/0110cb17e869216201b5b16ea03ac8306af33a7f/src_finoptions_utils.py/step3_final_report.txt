  "purpose": "A decorator factory that copies the __doc__ attribute from a source function to a target function.",
  "sources": "The source function's __doc__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "The target function's __doc__ attribute.",
  "flows": "The source's __doc__ flows into the target's __doc__ when the decorator is applied.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated naming of functions and variables; no input validation or error handling; no external data or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a nested decorator function that assigns the __doc__ attribute from a source function to a target function. The obfuscated names do not affect functionality but hinder readability. No malicious payloads, external data handling, or security vulnerabilities are present. The purpose is benign: copying docstrings. The obfuscation is consistent with the high obfuscated scores but does not imply malicious intent. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are detected. The scores across reports correctly reflect the benign nature, with malware scores at 0, high obfuscation scores justified by naming, and very low security risk scores. The overall assessment is that the code is a simple, benign utility with obfuscation, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated decorator for copying docstrings, with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The high obfuscation is justified but does not indicate malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
