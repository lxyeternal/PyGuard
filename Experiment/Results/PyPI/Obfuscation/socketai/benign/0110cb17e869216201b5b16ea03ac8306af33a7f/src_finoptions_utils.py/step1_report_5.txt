{
  "purpose": "A decorator function that copies the docstring from one object to another",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'source' which is used to access its '__doc__' attribute",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data outputs or external communications",
  "flows": "The function takes 'source', returns a decorator that assigns 'source.__doc__' to 'target.__doc__'",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not perform any external actions, data storage, or network communication; no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads detected",
  "analysis": "The outer function 'DDDYWJSqSeqnQWfUDNsMCKReSHvyNnBH' returns an inner decorator 'nTFBcuZYhZKioUvSYmhUXRBhELhZBrdd'. This decorator copies the '__doc__' attribute from 'source' to 'target'. The code does not perform any input validation, external calls, or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a simple utility for documentation purposes. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign decorator utility intended to copy documentation strings from one object to another. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation are present.",
