  "purpose": "The code defines a decorator function that copies the docstring from one function to another.",
  "sources": "The source function parameter passed into the outer function.",
  "sinks": "Assigning the docstring to the target function's __doc__ attribute.",
  "flows": "The source function's __doc__ is assigned to the target function's __doc__.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses non-descriptive, obfuscated function and variable names; the decorator only copies docstrings without performing any additional logic. No input validation or data handling present.",
  "analysis": "The outer function 'DDDYWJSqSeqnQWfUDNsMCKReSHvyNnBH' accepts a source function as input. It returns a nested function 'nTFBcuZYhZKioUvSYmhUXRBhELhZBrdd' which, when applied to a target function, copies the source's __doc__ string to the target's __doc__ attribute. The implementation is straightforward and does not perform any malicious actions, data processing, or external communications. The obfuscated names are suspicious but do not inherently indicate malicious intent; they could be used to hide purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple decorator for copying docstrings between functions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated naming could be a sign of obfuscation or hiding intent, but functionally, it is benign.",
