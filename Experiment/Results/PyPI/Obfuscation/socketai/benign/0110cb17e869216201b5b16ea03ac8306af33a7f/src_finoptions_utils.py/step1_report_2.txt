{
  "purpose": "The function appears to be a decorator that copies the docstring from a source function to a target function.",
  "sources": "The source parameter, which is expected to be a function with a __doc__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; the code only modifies the __doc__ attribute of a target function.",
  "flows": "The decorator receives a source function, then applies the inner function to a target, copying the docstring.",
  "anomalies": "The code is unusually obfuscated with nonsensical function and variable names, which could be a sign of evasion or obfuscation. No actual malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system manipulation are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a decorator function 'DDDYWJSqSeqnQWfUDNsMCKReSHvyNnBH' that takes a source function. Inside, it defines 'nTFBcuZYhZKioUvSYmhUXRBhELhZBrdd', which assigns the source's __doc__ attribute to the target function's __doc__. The purpose is likely to copy documentation strings between functions. There are no inputs, outputs, or external interactions that suggest malicious activity. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt to hide intent but does not inherently imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, obfuscated decorator for copying a function's docstring to another function. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation alone is not suspicious in this context but warrants caution if part of a larger, malicious payload.",
