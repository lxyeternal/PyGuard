  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of financial models with obfuscation likely for proprietary reasons. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats. The high obfuscation score reflects naming concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code poses a low security risk."
