{
  "purpose": "The code implements financial models related to option pricing, probability calculations, and implied volatility estimation using numerical methods and scientific libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from class attributes, method parameters, and external libraries; no external network or file I/O observed.",
  "sinks": "Outputs include return values, print statements, and object state modifications; no data exfiltration or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and class attributes through mathematical functions and numerical root-finding procedures to outputs and internal states.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, but no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard financial calculations for option pricing and implied volatility, utilizing common scientific libraries. Obfuscation appears to be for proprietary concealment rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. The numerical methods and logic align with legitimate financial modeling practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of financial models with obfuscation likely for proprietary reasons. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security threats. The high obfuscation score reflects naming concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code poses a low security risk.",
