{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes for various binomial and trinomial option pricing models, and includes functions for visualizing option trees and calculating option prices.",
  "sources": "Data is read from class attributes, method parameters, and external modules; primarily from the self._tree object and function inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage or malicious activity could occur if untrusted data flows into visualization functions or external network connections (none are explicitly present).",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes or method inputs into calculations and visualizations; no network or file I/O is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are detected. Obvious obfuscation or misleading variable names are absent. The code heavily relies on numpy and matplotlib without malicious pattern usage.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement standard financial models for option pricing using binomial and trinomial trees, with visualization of the resulting trees. It imports common scientific libraries, and the class methods perform typical calculations related to option valuation. No network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior such as code injection, hidden backdoors, or cryptomining routines is observed. The structure is consistent with legitimate financial computation code, with function names and variables aligned with their purpose. The use of decorators and external modules also suggests standard practices. No indicators of malicious intent or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be legitimate financial modeling code for option pricing, with visualization tools. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. The overall security risk is low.",
