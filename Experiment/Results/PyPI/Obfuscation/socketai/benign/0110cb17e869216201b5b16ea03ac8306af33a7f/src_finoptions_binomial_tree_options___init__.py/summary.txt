  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, heavily obfuscated implementation of financial option models with visualization features. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation is likely for proprietary concealment rather than malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score is appropriate at 0.0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), reflecting the difficulty in understanding the code, and the overall risk score remains low (~0.2)."
