  "purpose": "Implementation of financial models, options pricing, implied volatility calculations, and Greeks analysis.",
  "sources": "Class properties, method parameters, numpy arrays, external libraries (_root, _root_scalar, _np, etc.), dynamic method calls.",
  "sinks": "No network, file I/O, or system modification; potential data leaks via string formatting but benign.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through mathematical functions, probability calculations, and optimization routines without suspicious data injection.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, complex nested functions, use of abstract classes, deep copy methods; these could be for concealment but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate financial modeling using standard scientific libraries. No malicious payloads, network activity, or sabotage routines are present. Obfuscation appears to serve intellectual property or security through obscurity rather than malicious intent. The structure supports extensibility but does not indicate malicious extension. The complex calculations and use of advanced routines are typical for such models.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated but legitimate implementation of options pricing and implied volatility calculations. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The supply chain security risk is minimal.",
