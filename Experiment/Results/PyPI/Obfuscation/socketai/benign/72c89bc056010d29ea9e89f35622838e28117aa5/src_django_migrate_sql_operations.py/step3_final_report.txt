  "purpose": "Defines custom Django migration operations for managing SQL states, including creation, alteration, reversal, and deletion, with obfuscated class and method names.",
  "sources": "Constructor parameters providing SQL scripts and configuration data, imported modules (.config, .graph), class attributes holding SQL strings.",
  "sinks": "Generation of SQL command strings, modification of migration nodes, potential execution of SQL scripts during migrations.",
  "flows": "From constructor inputs and class attributes through methods that generate descriptive SQL commands and modify migration nodes.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names, import of unknown modules (.config, .graph), handling of SQL scripts without explicit validation, complex internal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom Django migration operations with obfuscated identifiers, capable of handling SQL scripts dynamically. The import of external modules with cryptic names and the capacity to execute or manipulate SQL scripts pose security concerns. No explicit malicious activity such as network activity or data exfiltration is observed, but the obfuscation and dynamic SQL handling could be exploited to inject malicious scripts if inputs are untrusted. The code's structure suggests potential misuse, warranting caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and dynamic SQL handling capabilities, which could be exploited for malicious purposes, although no direct malicious activity is confirmed. The capacity to execute arbitrary SQL scripts during migrations, combined with obfuscation, indicates a significant security risk. Further source verification and runtime analysis are recommended before deployment.",
