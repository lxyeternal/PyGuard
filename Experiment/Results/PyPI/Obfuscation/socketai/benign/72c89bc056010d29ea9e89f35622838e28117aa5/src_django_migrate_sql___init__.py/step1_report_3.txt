  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow leading to sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears random and does not convey meaningful information; no other code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name to a version string. No input reading, no untrusted data handling, and no suspicious behaviors detected. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no indications of malicious intent or obfuscation beyond the obfuscated variable name.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple version assignment with a non-descriptive variable name. There are no malicious behaviors, no malware indications, and no security risks detected.",
