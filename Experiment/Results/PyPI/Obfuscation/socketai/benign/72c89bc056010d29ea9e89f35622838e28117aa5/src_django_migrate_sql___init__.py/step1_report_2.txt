  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement reading no external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow or external output involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is a simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name: 'TsXpIuwvGMZWzMRKKnVuEYzZEPrthPTZ', which appears obfuscated or random, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single variable assignment with a seemingly random string as the variable name and a version string as its value. There are no external inputs, outputs, or behavior indicating malicious intent. The variable name's obfuscated nature could be a technique to hide intent, but in this context, it appears benign, possibly a placeholder or obfuscation. No suspicious code constructs, data leaks, or malicious actions are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment assigning a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
