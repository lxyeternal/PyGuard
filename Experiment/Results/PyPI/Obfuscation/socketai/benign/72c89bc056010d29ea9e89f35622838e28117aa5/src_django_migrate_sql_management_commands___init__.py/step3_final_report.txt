  "purpose": "The code performs data processing tasks, potentially involving environment variables, user input, or file operations, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external files",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system, subprocess calls",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, possibly leading to network or file operations",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs detected",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign, straightforward code with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. The malware scores are consistently 0, and obfuscation scores are 0, reflecting no suspicious code features. The security risk scores are moderate in some reports (around 0.3), but given the lack of evidence, these can be conservatively lowered to approximately 0.2 for better alignment. Confidence levels are high, as the assessments are based on thorough analysis. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are identified, and the code appears safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malware or obfuscation detected. The slight security risk scores are appropriate but can be marginally reduced to reflect the absence of suspicious activity. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
