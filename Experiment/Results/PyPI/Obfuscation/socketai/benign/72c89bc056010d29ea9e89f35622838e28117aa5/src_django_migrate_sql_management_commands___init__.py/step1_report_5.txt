{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing and possibly interaction with external resources, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., reading user input), environment variables, file reads, network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes/deletes, system commands, or execution of dynamic code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (network, files, system commands), potentially via intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data processing with standard Python constructs. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system manipulation, was identified. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal. No unusual code patterns, backdoors, or hidden functionality are evident. The absence of suspicious network activity or credential handling reduces concern for malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior or supply chain risks. The code appears to be benign, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
