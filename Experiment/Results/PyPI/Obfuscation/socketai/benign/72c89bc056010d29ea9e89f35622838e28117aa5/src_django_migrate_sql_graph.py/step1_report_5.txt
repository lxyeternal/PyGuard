  "raw_response": "{\n  \"purpose\": \"The code appears to manage dependency graphs for application configurations, particularly focusing on SQL configuration modules within Django apps. It constructs a directed graph of nodes representing app dependencies and performs cycle detection.\",\n  \"sources\": \"Input sources include Django app configurations ('apps.app_configs') and module imports via 'import_module'. Data is read from settings and imported modules, and dependencies are read from objects within imported modules.\",\n  \"sinks\": \"Potential sinks include dynamic imports and method calls that could execute untrusted code or manipulate data structures. Specifically, 'import_module' and subsequent attribute accesses, as well as the 'exec' or 'eval'-like behavior if present in dependencies, could be points of concern.\",\n  \"flows\": \"Data flows from 'apps.app_configs' and 'import_module' imports into the graph construction methods, especially 'vDoyYxVIlLYOMOtQqAjOgJAzMezvEBEZ', which adds nodes and dependencies. The 'TKnCmtfXotumyarbZQxlXTHTHhADYIIr' method traverses the graph for cycle detection, potentially exposing complex dependency paths.\",\n  \"anomalies\": \"The code contains obfuscated variable names, dynamic module imports based on settings, and the use of 'import_module' in a loop over app configs. The presence of dynamic imports using concatenated strings ('\".\".join') and the handling of app-specific configuration modules could be exploited for malicious imports if the settings are tampered with. The code also references potentially undefined variables like 'TQWCWoEymAWoRLQvBPxOFaLFBnbxeiBi', indicating incomplete or obfuscated code sections.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code constructs a dependency graph for app configurations and their SQL modules, adding nodes and edges based on dependencies. It performs cycle detection to prevent circular dependencies. The use of dynamic import statements and the reliance on external configuration settings can be risky if those settings are manipulated. Obfuscated variable names hinder readability and may be intentional to conceal malicious intent. The code does not perform any overt malicious actions like network communication, file modification, or data exfiltration. However, the dynamic imports and complex dependency logic could be exploited if malicious modules are introduced or if configuration data is compromised.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code primarily manages dependency graphs for application configurations with some obfuscated variable names and dynamic imports, which could be exploited if combined with malicious modules or misconfigured settings. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware, but the complexity and dynamic nature warrant careful review of the runtime environment and configuration inputs.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.75,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.7,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.4\n}",
