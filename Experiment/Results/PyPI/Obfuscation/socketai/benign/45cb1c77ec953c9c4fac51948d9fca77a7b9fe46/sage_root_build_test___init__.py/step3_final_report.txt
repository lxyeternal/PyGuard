{
  "purpose": "The code is a benign Python script handling user input, environment variables, or data processing without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., input()), environment variables, data read from files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output, network connections, file writes, subprocess calls, or database queries, but no malicious activity detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, env vars) to sinks (outputs, network, files) without suspicious manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures observed; no network activity or malicious functions.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets described are straightforward, with no dangerous functions like eval() or exec(). No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the benign nature. The malware score (0) is justified as no malicious intent is evident. The confidence level is high (0.9) due to clear descriptions and absence of suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is benign, with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The low security risk score accurately reflects minimal potential threat. The overall assessment indicates safe, straightforward scripts with no indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
