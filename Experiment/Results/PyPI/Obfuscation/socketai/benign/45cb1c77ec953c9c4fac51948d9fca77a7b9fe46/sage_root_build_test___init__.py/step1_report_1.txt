{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility for processing user input and performing a calculation, possibly for a calculator or data processing task.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as 'input()' for user-provided data.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of 'exec()' or 'eval()' functions with untrusted input (if present), or output functions like 'print()' that could display sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to computation functions, and then potentially to output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected. No use of obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. No external network calls or suspicious domain connections observed. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads user input and performs calculations or data processing. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. No obfuscated or suspicious constructs were identified. The absence of dangerous functions like 'eval()' or 'exec()' with untrusted input, and no network operations, reduces risk. The code's simplicity suggests it is benign and aligns with typical utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious intent or malware. It appears to be a standard, benign script performing basic input and output operations. The overall security risk is low.",
