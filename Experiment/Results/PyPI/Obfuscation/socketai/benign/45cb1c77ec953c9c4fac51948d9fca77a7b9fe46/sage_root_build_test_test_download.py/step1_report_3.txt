  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple comment or placeholder indicating an intention to test downloading files.",
  "sources": "No actual code present; no data input or data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows identified due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment line with no executable statements, which is unusual for a functional script.",
  "analysis": "The provided code contains only a comment line '# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-' and a phrase 'Test downloading files' without any executable code. This indicates it is either incomplete, a placeholder, or a non-functional note. There are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks. The lack of actual code means no vulnerabilities or malware can be inferred from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-functional and does not perform any operations, including downloading files or other potentially malicious activities. It appears to be a comment or note without executable logic. Therefore, there are no security concerns or malicious indicators.",
