  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated build/setup script for SageMath with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the operations appear to be legitimate configuration and build steps. The assigned scores are appropriate: low malware risk (0.1), high obfuscation (0.8), and moderate security risk (0.4). Vigilance is advised if used in untrusted environments, but no active malicious behavior is detected."
