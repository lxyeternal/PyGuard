  "conclusion": "The script is benign and intended for configuration inspection, but its design allows potential exposure of secrets if 'sage_conf' contains sensitive information. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation and unvalidated attribute access warrant caution but do not constitute malware."
