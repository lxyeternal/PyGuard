{
  "purpose": "This script appears to be a command-line utility to display configuration variables from the 'sage_conf' module, either a specific variable or all variables.",
  "sources": "Reading command-line arguments via argparse, importing 'sage_conf', accessing attributes of 'sage_conf' module",
  "sinks": "Outputting variable values to stdout using write(), accessing attributes of 'sage_conf' dynamically",
  "flows": "Command-line input -> parsing arguments -> accessing 'sage_conf' attributes -> writing output",
  "anomalies": "Unobfuscated, normal structure; no hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns. Use of dynamic attribute access is standard for config display.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that imports modules, sets up argument parsing, and outputs configuration data from 'sage_conf'. It reads an optional command-line argument to output a specific variable, or all variables if none specified. There is no user input sanitization or network activity. The dynamic access of attributes is typical for configuration scripts. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected, and no obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration display utility with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It simply outputs configuration variables, with normal usage of modules and functions.",
