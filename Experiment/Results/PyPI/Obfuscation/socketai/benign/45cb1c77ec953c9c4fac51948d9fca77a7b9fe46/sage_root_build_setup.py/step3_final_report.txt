{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and package files.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() parameters, including package names, author info, URLs, and file lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; static data assigned to setup() arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (nonsensical strings), but no malicious or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard static setup script with obfuscated variable names. No dynamic execution, network activity, or external data handling is present. The shebang points to a custom interpreter, which could be unusual but not malicious. The metadata appears legitimate. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent. Malware score is zero, risk is very low (~0.2), and confidence is high (~0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely stylistic or to obscure variable names but does not indicate sabotage or malware.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
