{
  "purpose": "The script is designed to set up a Python package named 'sage_bootstrap' with associated metadata and files for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string values for package metadata, such as author name, email, and version, as well as lists of package dependencies and file paths.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the use of 'distutils.core.setup' which can install files and dependencies; however, no direct untrusted input handling or network communication is present.",
  "flows": "The flow involves static package metadata being passed to the setup function, which then proceeds to install files and dependencies. There is no indication of data flowing from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of non-standard variable names, base64-looking strings, and seemingly random variable names suggest obfuscation or masking of intent, although no actual malicious code such as network access or data exfiltration is present.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, possibly intended to hide the actual purpose. It only contains static data and a typical setup call. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious network activity, or data theft. The unusual variable names could be an attempt at obfuscation but do not directly imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a legitimate package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks based on the provided content.",
