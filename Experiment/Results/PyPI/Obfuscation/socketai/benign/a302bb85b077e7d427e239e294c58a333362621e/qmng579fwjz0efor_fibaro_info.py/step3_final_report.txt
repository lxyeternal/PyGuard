  "purpose": "Retrieve device/system info via REST API and classify device attributes using pattern matching against external dictionaries.",
  "sources": "REST API endpoint 'settings/info' providing raw_data; external imported dictionaries for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data exfiltration observed; data is processed locally for classification.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API into raw_data, then accessed via properties; pattern matching against imported dictionaries for classification.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in variable names and imported constants; no malicious code or network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches device info and classifies it through pattern matching. Obfuscated variable names and external mappings are suspicious but not malicious. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network activity are present. The pattern matching relies on external dictionaries, which could be malicious if compromised, but no evidence here. Malware scores are low (0 or 0.2), and obfuscation scores are high (~0.75-0.8), consistent across reports. Overall, the code appears benign but obfuscated, warranting cautious review of external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a device info retrieval and classification module with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity. The security risk is low, with high obfuscation scores due to variable naming and external mappings. No active threats are detected, but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring, especially regarding external dictionaries.",
