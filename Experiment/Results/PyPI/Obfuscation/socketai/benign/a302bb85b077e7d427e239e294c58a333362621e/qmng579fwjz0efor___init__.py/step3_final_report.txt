  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided summaries and scoring rationale.",
  "sources": "Code reading input or data, environment variables, network/file operations, dynamic execution methods.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network/file operations or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic execution methods (eval, exec), inconsistent risk scores given lack of code, potential indirect calls, or suspicious patterns without concrete code.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack explicit code but conclude benign behavior with low malware and obfuscation scores (0). The security risk scores are uniformly 0.2, reflecting cautious but benign assessments. Confidence levels are high where detailed review is implied. Slight adjustments are recommended: reducing security risk scores to 0 or 0.1 for reports with no code, and increasing to 0.3 for report 4 due to mention of dynamic execution methods. Malware and obfuscation scores are justified at 0 across all reports, given no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The reasoning aligns with the summaries, and the scores are consistent with the conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent in their assessments, with appropriate scores reflecting the absence of malicious activity. Minor score adjustments improve alignment with the lack of code and potential dynamic features. Overall, the evaluations are justified and conservative, suitable for the provided summaries.",
