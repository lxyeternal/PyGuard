  "purpose": "A simple wrapper class that retrieves login status data from a REST client and exposes the 'status' field.",
  "sources": "rest_client.get('loginStatus') call during initialization",
  "sinks": "Access to self.raw_data.get('status')",
  "flows": "Initialization fetch from REST client -> storage in self.raw_data -> property access to 'status'",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import and class names; no other suspicious or malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated class, initializes by calling a REST API endpoint 'loginStatus', and provides a property to access the 'status' key. No malicious code, data exfiltration, or network activity is evident. Obfuscation is present but could be for concealment; however, the logic remains benign. The data flow is straightforward, with no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent given the lack of other indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated wrapper around a REST API call to retrieve login status. No malware or malicious activity is detected. Obfuscation alone warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
