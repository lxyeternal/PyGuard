      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate scene management interface with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation and dynamic URL construction could be exploited in a malicious context, but on its own, the code appears benign. The overall security risk is low, with obfuscation being the main concern. Scores should reflect a malware score of 0, high obfuscation, and a moderate security risk due to potential misuse if inputs are malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code is a device info retrieval and classification module with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity. The security risk is low, with high obfuscation scores due to variable naming and external mappings. No active threats are detected, but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring, especially regarding external dictionaries."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign data wrapper with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected. Obfuscation warrants review in a broader context but does not indicate malicious intent on its own. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "While the heavy obfuscation warrants caution, there is no static evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The code functions as a device management library with typical data handling and API interactions, but its obfuscated nature suggests the need for further dynamic or runtime analysis to confirm safety."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, wrapper for Fibaro components. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities in this snippet. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but without further inspection of imported modules, the overall threat remains low."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with suspicious import and nonsensical naming, raising suspicion. However, no concrete malicious activity or malicious intent is evident from the static analysis. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the functional logic appears benign. Therefore, the malware score should be increased modestly to reflect suspicion, but overall, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior."
