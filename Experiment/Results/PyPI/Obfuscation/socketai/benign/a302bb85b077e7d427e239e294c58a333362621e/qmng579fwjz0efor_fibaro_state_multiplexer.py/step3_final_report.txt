  "purpose": "Device management, state updates, event handling, and callback registration for Fibaro devices.",
  "sources": "Input data via functions like QSfMqZbOdcXyEPYQmERDegDKDVMiLxkO, external helper modules, and the client object.",
  "sinks": "Device state dictionaries, callback functions, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Input data processed through helper functions → device state updates or event triggers → callbacks invoked.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class, method, and variable names; use of dynamic data handling without explicit validation; no hardcoded credentials or network activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The code manages device states and events with heavily obfuscated identifiers, which may be to conceal proprietary logic. No network activity, credential leaks, or malicious payloads are observed. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious behavior. The data flows are typical for device management systems, and no suspicious patterns such as data exfiltration or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate device management component with obfuscation possibly for proprietary reasons. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify a malicious malware score.",
