  "purpose": "Define a class for handling room data fetched from a REST client, including methods for instantiation and retrieval of room attributes.",
  "sources": "Data read from the rest_client.get('rooms') method in the static method OcnzJPyGBtJZldOuGNgUDkKEEqHKeaJo.",
  "sinks": "Data from rest_client.get('rooms') is processed but not directly written to external systems; no explicit data sinks like file writes, network transmissions, or database inserts are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the REST client's get method to raw_data, then to instances of the class, and accessed via properties.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, or obfuscation detected. The class structure appears standard. The import from a local module is typical but worth noting as a potential point for dependency inspection.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data model class with properties to access specific fields ('id' and 'name') from a dictionary. The static method OcnzJPyGBtJZldOuGNgUDkKEEqHKeaJo calls a REST client's get method to retrieve a list of raw data, then instantiates objects for each data entry. No data is transmitted, stored insecurely, or manipulated maliciously. The import statement references a possibly obscure module, but this alone is not suspicious. Overall, the code performs straightforward data encapsulation and retrieval without any signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard data handler class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It fetches data from an external REST API and provides accessors for specific fields. There are no suspicious or malicious actions detected within this module.",
