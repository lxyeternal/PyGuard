      "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated data analysis toolkit for entropy and network measures. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious activity. The high obfuscation is likely for concealment, not malicious intent. The low malware and security risk scores are justified."

      "conclusion": "The code in Report 3 exhibits strong indicators of malicious behavior, warranting high malware and obfuscation scores. Other reports are benign, with scores reflecting their lack of suspicious features. Minor adjustments to confidence scores in benign reports could improve precision, but overall, the scores are consistent and justified."
