{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python module or script that performs certain operations, possibly related to data processing or utility functions. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent based on the visible code.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or possibly external files if present. Specific source points are not explicitly visible without the actual code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls if present. No explicit sinks are observed in the provided code snippet due to lack of concrete code lines.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, files) if applicable. Without concrete code, exact source-to-sink paths cannot be definitively mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are visible. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names detected in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited as the actual code content was not provided. Based on the instructions, the absence of explicit malicious patterns suggests typical code behavior. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoor mechanisms are evident from the given input.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on the provided information. There are no apparent malicious behaviors, supply chain attacks, or security risks detected. Due to lack of detailed code, this assessment has low to moderate confidence.",
  "confidence": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0,
