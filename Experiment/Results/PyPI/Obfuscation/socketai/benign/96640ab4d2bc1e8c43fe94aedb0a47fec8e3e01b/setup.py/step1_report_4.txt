  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ordpy' Python package, used for data analysis with permutation entropy and ordinal networks.",
  "sources": "Reads the content of 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads file content into a variable; no data flow to insecure sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive variable name ('IkqrNtYOSYHqaUHBoLozRjdVdOUzFzbj') for the README content; otherwise standard setup procedure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools, reads a README file for the long description, and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata. No suspicious or malicious code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no suspicious network activity. The unusual variable name for the README content appears to be an obfuscation attempt, but it does not perform malicious actions. The code is a typical setup script with minor obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with a minor obfuscation of variable name, which does not indicate malicious intent. No security risks or malware detected.",
