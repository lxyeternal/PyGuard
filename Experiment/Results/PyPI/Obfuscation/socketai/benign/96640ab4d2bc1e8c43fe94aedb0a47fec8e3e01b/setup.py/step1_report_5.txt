{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'ordpy' Python package, used to specify package metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file as package description; static metadata definitions in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No data is transmitted, executed dynamically, or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Reading README file content (source) assigned to a variable, then passed as parameter to setuptools.setup (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive variable name 'IkqrNtYOSYHqaUHBoLozRjdVdOUzFzbj' for the README content, which appears obfuscated, but no malicious intent is evident.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup operations. It reads a README file with specified encoding, assigns the content to a variable, then calls setuptools.setup with package metadata, including the README content. Variable naming is unusual and looks obfuscated but does not indicate malicious activity. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or insecure practices are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical Python setup script with an obfuscated variable name but no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely performs package configuration.",
