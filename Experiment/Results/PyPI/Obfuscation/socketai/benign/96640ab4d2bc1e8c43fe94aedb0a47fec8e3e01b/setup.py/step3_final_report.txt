{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads a README file and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file; static assignment of file content to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "File read -> store in obfuscated variable -> pass to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated variable name for static content; no malicious code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with minimal obfuscation. It reads a local README file into a variable with an obscure name and uses it in package configuration. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. The obfuscation appears superficial and likely stylistic. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.2, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with minor superficial obfuscation. There is no malicious activity or security risk present. The current assessment scores are appropriate and justified.",
