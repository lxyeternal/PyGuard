{
  "purpose": "To set up and configure the 'ordpy' Python package for distribution via setuptools.",
  "sources": "Reading file 'README.rst' for long description; using hardcoded package metadata and filename variables.",
  "sinks": "Calling setuptools.setup with package metadata and long description; no untrusted data sink observed.",
  "flows": "Reading file content as input for the long description parameter; static package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive variable name 'IkqrNtYOSYHqaUHBoLozRjdVdOUzFzbj' for file content; variable name obfuscation may indicate code concealment. No other suspicious code, backdoors, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward package setup using setuptools. It reads a README file with a standard encoding, assigns its content to a variable, and passes it into the setup function. All other parameters are static and hardcoded. No user input, network calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The variable name for the README content is obfuscated but does not introduce malicious behavior. The script aligns with typical Python package setup practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected. There are no signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious behavior.",
