{
  "purpose": "The code implements functions for analyzing time series and network data using entropy, permutation, and complexity measures. It processes data in-memory with numpy, focusing on statistical and information-theoretic analysis.",
  "sources": "Data is read from numpy arrays or distributions provided as function inputs; no external data sources or file I/O are involved.",
  "sinks": "No external communication, network activity, or system modifications; data remains within in-memory numpy arrays and calculations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays into mathematical functions computing entropy, divergence, and network measures, with no external or system interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are heavily obfuscated, but no malicious code, credentials, or backdoors are detected. Obfuscation appears for code concealment or minimization, not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform standard statistical and information-theoretic calculations, including entropy, divergence, permutation analysis, and network measures. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. Obfuscation is superficial, likely for code protection. The code is consistent with scientific analysis tools rather than malicious software.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated data analysis toolkit for entropy and network measures. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious activity. The high obfuscation is likely for concealment, not malicious intent. The low malware and security risk scores are justified.",
