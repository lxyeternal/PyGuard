  "purpose": "Classes and functions for handling BIDS file paths and entities, including pattern matching and metadata extraction.",
  "sources": "Filename strings, bidspath objects, regex patterns, external layout objects.",
  "sinks": "Regex matching on filenames, attribute access, pattern matching results.",
  "flows": "Source data (filenames, patterns) processed through regex and attribute access, with pattern matching and entity extraction.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, placeholder methods raising exceptions, warnings about incomplete support and buggy features.",
  "analysis": "The code handles BIDS file paths and entities with pattern matching and regex compilation. It contains placeholder methods and warnings indicating incomplete features, but no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is evident. The obfuscated naming appears stylistic or developmental rather than malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls are present. The overall structure suggests a partial implementation of a data handling library, with no active security threats or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit incomplete, component for BIDS data management. There are no signs of supply chain compromise, malware, or malicious behavior. Obfuscation is minimal and likely stylistic. The security risk score is appropriately low, and malware score is zero.",
