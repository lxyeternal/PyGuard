{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes/functions from the 'rsbids' package, including obfuscated identifiers, and define the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'rsbids.entry', 'rsbids._lib', and 'rsbids.bidspath' modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; code only imports modules without executing or processing data.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class/function names (e.g., VLGTlzMxXFUNXiqumufTGAAGDFkJpPYO, pQXEzrcksJlHjPDsXRUAbgMbvzstbFlw) which obscure their purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which can be a tactic to hide proprietary or malicious code. No active code, data handling, or network activity is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (low malware, high obfuscation, moderate risk) are consistent with the code's nature. Further review of the actual 'rsbids' package source is recommended to verify the purpose of these obfuscated components.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign in isolation but employs obfuscation tactics that warrant caution. No evidence of malicious behavior is present, but further investigation into the 'rsbids' package is advised to rule out hidden malicious code within the obfuscated components.",
