      "conclusion": "The code functions as a utility wrapper with obfuscated identifiers, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The primary concern is the external class's internal behavior, which remains unverified. The low malware score (around 0.2) and high obfuscation score (around 0.8) reflect this assessment. Further static or dynamic analysis of the external class is recommended before deploying in security-sensitive contexts."
