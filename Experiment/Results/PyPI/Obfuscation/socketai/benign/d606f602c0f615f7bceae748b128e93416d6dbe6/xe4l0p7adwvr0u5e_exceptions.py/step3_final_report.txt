{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, likely for use in larger codebases or as a placeholder.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code is a class declaration with no input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the class does not process or output data, nor does it interact externally.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class is a simple inheritance without methods or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual and may indicate concealment or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class inheriting from Exception with an obfuscated name. No data input/output, no logic, and no external interactions are present. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware score 0, obfuscated score ~0.8, security risk ~0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high obfuscation score reflects the unusual class name, but without additional context, the code appears harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal class definition with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risk based solely on this snippet. The scores are appropriate and justified, with high confidence that the code is not malicious.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
