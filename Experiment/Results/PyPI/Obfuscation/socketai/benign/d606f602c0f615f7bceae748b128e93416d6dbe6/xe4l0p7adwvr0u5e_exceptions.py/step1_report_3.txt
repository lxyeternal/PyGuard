  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named qtqsqScWggwPTGYThjxQvxVZsQxYsaIQ",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow, as this is a simple class definition",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name that appears obfuscated or nonsensical; no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition inheriting from Exception, with a complex and seemingly random class name. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or contain any suspicious constructs. The unusual class name may indicate obfuscation or a placeholder, but without additional context, it does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, minimal class definition for a custom exception with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
