  "flows": "No data flow as the code only declares an exception class",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no additional logic or context provided",
  "analysis": "The code creates a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. It contains no logic, input/output, or data handling. The name does not provide semantic meaning and seems intentionally obscure, which can sometimes indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent. No suspicious behavior or malicious code is present within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class declaration of an exception with an unusual name. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on this fragment. The obfuscated class name warrants note, but there is no active malicious intent or security concern in the provided code.",
