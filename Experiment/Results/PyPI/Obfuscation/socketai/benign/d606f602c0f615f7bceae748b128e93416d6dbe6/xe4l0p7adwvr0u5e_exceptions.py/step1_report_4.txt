  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named qtqsqScWggwPTGYThjxQvxVZsQxYsaIQ",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, no external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be an obfuscated or nonsensical string; no meaningful purpose or context provided. The class does nothing other than inherit Exception.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition inheriting from Exception with a seemingly random or obfuscated class name. There are no data inputs, no processing, no external interactions. The class could be used as a custom exception, but there is no evidence of malicious intent within this fragment alone. The lack of any additional logic or behavior indicates benign intent, though the naming suggests obfuscation or potential concealment.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines an obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It appears benign but could be part of a larger obfuscated codebase. Overall, no malicious activity or security issues are detected based solely on this snippet.",
