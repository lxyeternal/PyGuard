{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named 'qtqsqScWggwPTGYThjxQvxVZsQxYsaIQ' that inherits from Python's built-in Exception class.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; no external input reading is present.",
  "sinks": "No output or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or external connections.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only defines a class with no methods or operations.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious if the intent is concealment; however, no malicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of a single class definition for a custom exception with an obscure name. It does not include any input handling, external communications, or behavior that could be malicious. The obfuscated class name might suggest an attempt at concealment, but without further code or context, it is not inherently malicious. The code is minimal and syntactically correct, serving only as a custom exception placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. The obfuscated name alone does not imply malicious intent; it may be intentional or placeholder naming.",
