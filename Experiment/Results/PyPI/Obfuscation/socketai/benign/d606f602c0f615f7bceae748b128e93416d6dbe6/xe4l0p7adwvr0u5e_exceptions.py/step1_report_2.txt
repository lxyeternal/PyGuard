  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named qtqsqScWggwPTGYThjxQvxVZsQxYsaIQ",
  "sources": "Class definition does not read input or data",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines an exception class",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a nonsensical, randomly generated string rather than a meaningful identifier",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The class name is a random string, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. No logic, input handling, or external interactions are present. The unusual class name may suggest obfuscation or placeholder code, but it does not contain any malicious behaviors or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition with an unusual name but no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, possibly obfuscated or placeholder code.",
