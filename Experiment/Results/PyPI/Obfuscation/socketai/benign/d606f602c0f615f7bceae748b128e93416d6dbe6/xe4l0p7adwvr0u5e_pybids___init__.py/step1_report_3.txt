  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from a local module for use elsewhere in the package",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.layout'",
  "sinks": "No evident sink involving untrusted data or external effects",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; import statement only",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking identifier names (e.g., PAcGGEeGHYdctZRZRulVeruTUcQpyWzx) that appear deliberately obfuscated or nonsensical",
  "analysis": "The code imports two obfuscated identifiers from a local module, possibly to hide their purpose. The '__all__' list exposes three publicly accessible names, which seem normal for a package's interface. The obfuscated names in the import could suggest attempts to conceal functionality or simply be an artifact of obfuscation. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The code is minimal, standard in structure, with no apparent malicious payloads or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward import statement with obfuscated identifiers, potentially used to hide implementation details but not necessarily malicious. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present based solely on this snippet.",
