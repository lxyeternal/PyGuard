  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from a local module for use in the current package or script.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module (.layout).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data output, network, or external system interaction shown.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or untrusted input handling visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming of imported classes/functions: 'PAcGGEeGHYdctZRZRulVeruTUcQpyWzx' and 'lEAXaHGqHRJwjjKhyaDPPMdfbugAxnPC' appear as obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers, which is suspicious. The rest of the code only exports standard names.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a local module, then defines an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. The imported symbols have highly unusual, seemingly random names, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, such as hidden backdoors or hidden malicious classes. There is no evidence of data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior in this fragment. The suspicious names are the primary anomaly.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard import and export statement, but the imported symbols' bizarre names raise suspicion of obfuscation or malicious intent. Without additional context or the actual module content, this code could potentially hide malicious classes or functions.",
