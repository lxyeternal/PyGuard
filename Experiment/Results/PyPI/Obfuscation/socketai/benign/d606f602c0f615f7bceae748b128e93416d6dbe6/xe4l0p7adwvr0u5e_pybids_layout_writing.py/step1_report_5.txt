{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define utility functions related to processing or handling 'bids' data, possibly for a neuroimaging or medical imaging application, but the functions are not yet implemented.",
  "sources": "No actual data reading or input sources are present in the code; imports and function parameters suggest potential data inputs, but no data processing occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or output points are present; the functions are placeholders with no actual implementation or data handling.",
  "flows": "There are no executable data flows; the functions are stub functions that only call an error notification function.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking function names, imported exception with a seemingly nonsensical name, and calls to an undefined function 'qtqsqScWggwPTGYThjxQvxVZsQxYsaIQ' which appears to be used as a placeholder for unimplemented functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of import statements, function definitions, and calls to an undefined function that indicates unimplemented features. No actual logic, data handling, or malicious activities are present. The unconventional and obfuscated function names may suggest an attempt to hide intent or simply be placeholders. There are no hardcoded credentials, malicious network calls, or suspicious behaviors. Overall, the code appears to be incomplete or boilerplate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-functional placeholder code with no malicious behavior detected. It seems to be scaffolding for future implementation without any security concerns at this stage.",
