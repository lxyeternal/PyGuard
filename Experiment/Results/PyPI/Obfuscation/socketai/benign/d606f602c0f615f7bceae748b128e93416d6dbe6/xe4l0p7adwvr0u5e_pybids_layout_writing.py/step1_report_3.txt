{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions related to handling or processing 'bids' and file operations, likely part of a larger library or application dealing with data management.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, imported exceptions, and function parameters, but contains no direct input or data source interactions.",
  "sinks": "The functions contain placeholder calls to 'qtqsqScWggwPTGYThjxQvxVZsQxYsaIQ', which may be a stand-in for logging or error handling, but no actual sinks (such as network, file I/O, or external system calls) are explicitly present.",
  "flows": "The functions accept parameters but do not process or manipulate data, as their bodies only call the placeholder function. No data flows are apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The functions are unimplemented, with calls to 'qtqsqScWggwPTGYThjxQvxVZsQxYsaIQ' indicating placeholders or stubs. The placeholder function name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could suggest code obfuscation or a placeholder for further implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of function definitions with parameter annotations and a single import of an exception. Both functions call a placeholder function that raises a 'not yet implemented' message. No input sources, data processing, or data output mechanisms are active. The use of obfuscated or nonsensical function names and the placeholder calls suggest this is incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. The code does not perform any harmful actions or contain suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a stub or scaffold with no operational or malicious content. It appears to be part of a larger framework, awaiting implementation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident in its current form.",
