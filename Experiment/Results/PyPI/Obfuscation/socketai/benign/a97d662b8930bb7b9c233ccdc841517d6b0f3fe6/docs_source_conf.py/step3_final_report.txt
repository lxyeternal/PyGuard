  "purpose": "Static configuration data for Sphinx documentation setup, including extensions, URLs, themes, and project info.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments for configuration parameters such as extension lists, URLs, theme names, CSS paths, and project metadata.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data inputs; no dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A – static assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious patterns, secrets, or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments related to documentation configuration. No dynamic code, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are present. Variable name obfuscation is noted but is typical in configuration files and does not imply malicious intent. The absence of data flows, external inputs, or code execution indicates a benign purpose. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate security risks. Overall, the code is a standard configuration script with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign static configuration data for Sphinx documentation. Although variable names are obfuscated, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score remains at 0, the obfuscated score should be around 0.5 to reflect variable name obfuscation, and the overall security risk is negligible (~0.1).",
