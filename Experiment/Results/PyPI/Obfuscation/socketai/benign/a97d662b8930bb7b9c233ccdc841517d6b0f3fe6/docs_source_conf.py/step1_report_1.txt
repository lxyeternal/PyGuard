{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define configuration variables and metadata for a documentation project, likely using Sphinx.",
  "sources": "String assignments and list/dictionary definitions for configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No apparent untrusted data handling or data sinks that could lead to leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets static configuration values.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets that seem malicious. All data are static strings or lists typical for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for project metadata, dependencies, theme settings, and resource paths. No external inputs are processed, no dynamic code execution is present. The data appear to be standard configuration settings for a Sphinx documentation build. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or suspicious constructs detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration script for a documentation project with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
