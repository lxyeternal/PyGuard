  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and involves complex parsing routines that could conceal malicious activity. No explicit malicious payloads or system calls are detected, but the obfuscation and string manipulation routines pose a moderate security concern, especially if inputs are untrusted. External backend functions should be reviewed for safety. The overall malware likelihood is low to moderate, and the code warrants cautious handling and further review."
