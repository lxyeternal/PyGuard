  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network calls, subprocess executions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, subprocess outputs, environment variable access, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data input or environment variables to sinks like network sockets, file systems, or subprocesses.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (Report 3), dynamic execution, complex logic, potential concealment techniques, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with no suspicious activity; Report 3 shows significant obfuscation but no direct malicious payloads. Scores are generally consistent with descriptions. Slightly elevated obfuscation and security risk scores in some reports are justified by complexity and network activity. The malware scores remain low, reflecting no confirmed malicious behavior. Adjustments are minimal; increasing malware score in Report 3 from 0.2 to 0.3 aligns better with the high obfuscation level. Overall, the assessments are cautious but justified, with no evidence of supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code reviews and scoring are appropriate and consistent with the descriptions. While some code exhibits obfuscation, no active malicious activity is detected. Minor score adjustments can better reflect suspicion levels, but current evaluations are sufficiently cautious. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on available information.",
