{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility that performs some file operations and data processing, possibly for data analysis or transformation.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations (reading files), environment variables, and user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to files, print statements, and network calls (if any) within the code.",
  "flows": "Data is read from source files or environment variables, processed through functions or logic, and then written or outputted, potentially over the network or to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscated sections are observed. No unusual dynamic execution or code that manipulates system files maliciously.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file reading and data processing tasks, with straightforward logic. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries seems legitimate. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated code detected. The overall structure is typical for data processing scripts, with no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not show signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign data utility script with standard practices. No malicious signals identified.",
