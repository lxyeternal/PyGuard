  "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and configuration script with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score (0) is appropriate. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious, and the overall security risk is low (0.2). The subprocess calls and environment variable reliance are typical but should be monitored in untrusted environments. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, and the code is considered safe in its current form."
