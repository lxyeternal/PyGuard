{
  "purpose": "The code dynamically invokes methods on the Pool object, passing in attributes from an imported obfuscated module, likely for model or wizard registration or configuration.",
  "sources": "Import of an obfuscated module, attribute access within the module",
  "sinks": "Invocation of Pool.FiiMPuUvzHIjKHVqFPwJeAihNXwDNBem with parameters that could influence model or wizard behavior",
  "flows": "Imported module attributes -> arguments to Pool.FiiMPuUvzHIjKHVqFPwJeAihNXwDNBem calls",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated names, dynamic attribute access, repeated invocation with different parameters, lack of explicit logic or comments",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, making static analysis challenging. It imports a module with a nonsensical name and calls a method on Pool twice, passing in attributes from this module. No direct malicious actions (network, file I/O, credential theft) are visible. The pattern of dynamic invocation and obfuscation is often used to conceal malicious behavior, but can also be legitimate in dynamic frameworks like Tryton. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, while the low malware score indicates no explicit malicious activity. The code's intent appears to be dynamic registration or configuration, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Further analysis of the imported module and the method implementation is recommended before concluding safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscation and dynamic invocation but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The scores assigned are appropriate, with high obfuscation and low malware likelihood. Further review of the imported module and the invoked methods is advised to confirm safety.",
