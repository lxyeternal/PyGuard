  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate account setup utility within an ERP system, heavily obfuscated but without malicious intent. No signs of supply chain compromise or malware are present. The current low malware score (0) and low security risk score (0.2) are justified. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious, warranting a slightly higher obfuscation score (~0.75). Overall, the code appears safe, and no modifications to the scores are necessary."
