  "purpose": "Create and configure account charts and account properties within an ERP system, utilizing model lookups and wizard execution.",
  "sources": "get_company() function, Model.get() calls, account ID retrieval via get_id(), data passed to wizard form fields.",
  "sinks": "Wizard execution that modifies account data, setting form properties, and creating account properties.",
  "flows": "Data flows from get_company() and Model.get() to account ID retrieval, then into wizard form fields, leading to account creation and property setup.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and function names; no external network calls or data exfiltration observed; no hardcoded secrets or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard account setup routines using model lookups and wizard execution. Obfuscation is present but appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. No external communication, data leaks, or malicious payloads are evident. The functions retrieve account templates and IDs, then configure accounts accordingly. The absence of network activity or malicious code indicates a legitimate configuration utility, with obfuscation as the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate account setup utility within an ERP system, heavily obfuscated but without malicious intent. No signs of supply chain compromise or malware are present. The current low malware score (0) and low security risk score (0.2) are justified. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious, warranting a slightly higher obfuscation score (~0.75). Overall, the code appears safe, and no modifications to the scores are necessary.",
