      "conclusion": "The code is a standard build and configuration script with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score (0) is appropriate. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious, and the overall security risk is low (0.2). The subprocess calls and environment variable reliance are typical but should be monitored in untrusted environments. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the analysis, and the code is considered safe in its current form."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate account setup utility within an ERP system, heavily obfuscated but without malicious intent. No signs of supply chain compromise or malware are present. The current low malware score (0) and low security risk score (0.2) are justified. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious, warranting a slightly higher obfuscation score (~0.75). Overall, the code appears safe, and no modifications to the scores are necessary."

Minor score adjustments can better reflect suspicion levels, but current evaluations are sufficiently cautious. Overall, the dependency appears safe based on available information."

The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall security risk remains low. The scores in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
