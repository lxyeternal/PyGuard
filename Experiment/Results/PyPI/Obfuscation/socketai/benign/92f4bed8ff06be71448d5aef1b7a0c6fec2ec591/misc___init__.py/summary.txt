  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are potential indicators of malicious intent, but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads or network activity. The suspicion is moderate, warranting cautious handling. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with the highest concern in report 3. Overall, the package should be reviewed further before deployment, especially if obfuscation is detected."
