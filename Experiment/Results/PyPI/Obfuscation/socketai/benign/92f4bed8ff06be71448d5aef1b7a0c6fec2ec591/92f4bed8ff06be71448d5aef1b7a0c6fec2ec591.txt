      "conclusion": "The code is benign but suspicious due to obfuscation of the shebang line. No evidence of malicious activity is present. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious payloads if additional code were added later. Overall, the risk is minimal, but the obfuscated shebang warrants caution if encountered in a production environment."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a configuration and environment management utility with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not, in itself, malicious. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2) are justified given the analysis. Continued monitoring of environment and configuration files is recommended, but the code does not constitute malware or a high security threat."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily for documentation generation, with obfuscated variable names that could be used to conceal malicious intent but do not demonstrate malicious activity. The low malware score (0) and low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate. Slightly higher risk (0.3) could be considered if emphasizing potential injection points, but current evidence does not justify that."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are potential indicators of malicious intent, but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads or network activity. The suspicion is moderate, warranting cautious handling. The scores are consistent with the observed patterns, with the highest concern in report 3. Overall, the package should be reviewed further before deployment, especially if obfuscation is detected."
