  "conclusion": "The code functions as a configuration and environment management utility with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not, in itself, malicious. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2) are justified given the analysis. Continued monitoring of environment and configuration files is recommended, but the code does not constitute malware or a high security threat."
