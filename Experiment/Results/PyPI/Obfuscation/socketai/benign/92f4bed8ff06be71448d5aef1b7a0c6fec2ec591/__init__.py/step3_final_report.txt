  "purpose": "Shebang line with a suspicious, obfuscated interpreter path; no executable code present.",
  "sources": "Shebang line reading the interpreter path",
  "sinks": "None, as there is no code execution or data processing",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a shebang line exists",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated shebang path `/usr/bin/qnyiXaAJZcZUtCVMWTgjcZbrRcSYgqSz` with no accompanying code",
  "analysis": "The script contains only a shebang line with an unusual, obfuscated interpreter path, indicating potential obfuscation or placeholder use. No executable code, functions, or data flows are present, reducing immediate malicious risk. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but, in absence of further code or behavior, the malware risk remains minimal. The scores across reports are consistent with this assessment, with low malware likelihood and high obfuscation due to the nonsensical shebang.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign but suspicious due to obfuscation of the shebang line. No evidence of malicious activity is present. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious payloads if additional code were added later. Overall, the risk is minimal, but the obfuscated shebang warrants caution if encountered in a production environment.",
