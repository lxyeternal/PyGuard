      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated parameter that could be a secret or marker. No malicious activity or active threats are detected. The high obfuscation score suggests suspicion, but overall risk remains low. Further investigation into the parameter's purpose is recommended if context allows."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a legitimate linguistic analysis utility with significant obfuscation and subprocess usage that pose potential security risks. The malware score should be set around 0.3 due to the potential for command injection, and the obfuscation score around 0.7. The overall security risk is approximately 0.6, reflecting the subprocess execution vector. Proper input validation and deobfuscation are recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign NLP utility for linguistic pattern matching. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and for code organization rather than malicious intent."
