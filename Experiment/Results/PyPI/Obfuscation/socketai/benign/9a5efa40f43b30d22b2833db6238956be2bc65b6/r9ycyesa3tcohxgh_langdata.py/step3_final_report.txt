  "purpose": "Static linguistic analysis tool utilizing regex patterns and static language datasets for NLP tasks.",
  "sources": "Predefined string variables containing language data and regex pattern compilations.",
  "sinks": "No external data input, network communication, or system modifications; data flows are internal and static.",
  "flows": "Static data loaded into regex patterns and dictionaries, with no external or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are complex and non-descriptive, indicating obfuscation but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static datasets and regex patterns for language processing, with no dynamic code execution, network activity, or external data handling. Obfuscated variable names are present but are typical for configuration or to hinder reverse engineering, not indicative of malicious behavior. No backdoors, credentials, or malicious code are detected. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is moderate; security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign NLP utility for linguistic pattern matching. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and for code organization rather than malicious intent.",
