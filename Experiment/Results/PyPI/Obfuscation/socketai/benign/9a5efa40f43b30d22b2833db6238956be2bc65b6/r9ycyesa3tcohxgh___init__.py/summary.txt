  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a legitimate linguistic analysis utility with significant obfuscation and subprocess usage that pose potential security risks. The malware score should be set around 0.3 due to the potential for command injection, and the obfuscation score around 0.7. The overall security risk is approximately 0.6, reflecting the subprocess execution vector. Proper input validation and deobfuscation are recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."
