  "purpose": "Setup script for Python package using distutils, with an obfuscated parameter possibly serving as a secret or marker.",
  "sources": "The parameter 'TzsVTwSVtcBnRXgjTseprWOHqiwsDXmo' with value 'r9ycyesa3tcohxgh' passed to setup()",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call, which processes package metadata; no external data or network activity observed",
  "flows": "The obfuscated parameter and its value are included in the setup() call; no further data flow or external influence detected",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a highly obfuscated parameter name and hardcoded string value; no other suspicious code or network activity",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script importing distutils.core.setup and invoking it with package metadata. The main anomaly is the inclusion of a parameter with a non-standard, obfuscated name and a seemingly random string value. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly a placeholder or marker. The malware score is set to 0, consistent with the absence of malicious actions. The obfuscation score is moderate to high (~0.6-0.7), reflecting suspicion about the parameter's purpose. The security risk score remains low (~0.2), as no active threats are evident. The code's function is benign, but the obfuscated parameter warrants further review to understand its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated parameter that could be a secret or marker. No malicious activity or active threats are detected. The high obfuscation score suggests suspicion, but overall risk remains low. Further investigation into the parameter's purpose is recommended if context allows.",
