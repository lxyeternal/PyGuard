  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, managing dependencies, versioning, and build commands.",
  "sources": "Reading version.py, requirements files, and executing 'rm -vrf' command via os.system.",
  "sinks": "os.system command which executes 'rm -vrf' to delete build directories and files.",
  "flows": "Reading version and dependencies files -> Executing system command to remove files/directories.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from version.py; direct os.system call to delete files, which could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. Variable names are obfuscated, which is suspicious but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup operations: reading version info via exec(), loading dependencies, and defining a custom command to clean build artifacts. The use of exec() to execute code from version.py could be risky if version.py is malicious or tampered with, but it's common in setup scripts. The 'clean' command utilizes os.system to delete directories and files, which is normal but dangerous if misused; here, it targets specific build artifacts. No network activity, no data exfiltration, no hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. Variable obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide code intent but is not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose with some minor obfuscation and risky command execution that could be misused if the environment is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and a potentially risky delete command executed via os.system. No malicious behavior such as data theft, network communication, or backdoors is evident. The primary concern is the use of exec() and os.system with hardcoded commands, which could be exploited if the files involved are malicious or tampered with. Overall, the code has a low likelihood of malicious intent but includes practices that could be risky if misused.",
