{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package, reads configuration files, and defines a custom command to clean build artifacts.",
  "sources": "Reading files: 'version.py', 'requirements-test.txt', 'requirements.txt'; environment variables (none used); input parameters for setup.",
  "sinks": "os.system call executing 'rm -vrf ./build ./dist ./*.pyc ./*.tgz ./*.egg-info', which deletes directories and files.",
  "flows": "Configuration files are read to gather dependencies; the custom command's method 'saoFsdGJqgejVykvaOkzzIYkxLZxLWXs' executes a system command to delete files/directories.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to execute code from 'version.py' can be risky if content is malicious; the 'rm -vrf' command in the custom command can delete critical build artifacts, potentially disrupting or damaging the environment. Variable and class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly indicating obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The script loads version information via 'exec', which could be malicious if the file content is tampered. The 'setup' function configures package metadata, dependencies, and entry points, which is standard. However, the custom command 'pKQwbgYEXaWDGWmJahEnKoBGWGoMsSFM' includes a method that deletes build artifacts and related files/directories unconditionally using 'os.system' with a 'rm -vrf' command. This could be used to sabotage the build environment or destroy data. No other malicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or credential theft, are evident. Usage of obfuscated variable names and dynamic code execution are suspicious but may also be artifacts of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a package setup script with a suspicious custom command that deletes important build files and directories, potentially disrupting the environment. The use of 'exec' on external files and obfuscated names increases suspicion, but there is no direct evidence of malicious payload delivery or malware beyond sabotage of build artifacts.",
