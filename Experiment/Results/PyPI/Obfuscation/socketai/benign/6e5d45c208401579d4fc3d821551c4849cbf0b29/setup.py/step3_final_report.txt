{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, handling version info, dependencies, and custom commands including cleanup operations.",
  "sources": "Reads version.py via exec(), reads dependencies from requirements files, and executes a system command for cleanup.",
  "sinks": "exec() on version.py, os.system('rm -vrf ...') for cleanup, and reading dependency files.",
  "flows": "Version.py content executed via exec(); cleanup command executed via os.system; dependencies read from files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external file, obfuscated variable names, destructive os.system command, dynamic URL construction.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks but employs risky practices such as exec() and destructive cleanup commands. Variable obfuscation is present but not extreme. No network activity or malicious payloads are detected. The cleanup command could be misused to sabotage the environment if external files are maliciously altered. The obfuscation may be an attempt to hide intent but could also be just obfuscation. The use of exec() and os.system with destructive commands elevates potential security risks, especially if external files are compromised. Overall, the code is primarily benign but includes practices that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or malicious payloads but employs unsafe practices such as exec() and destructive system commands, which pose moderate security risks if external files are tampered with. Obfuscation is moderate. The overall security posture is cautious but not malicious.",
