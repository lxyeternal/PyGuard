  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package, including reading dependencies and defining custom commands.",
  "sources": "Reading files (version.py, requirements-test.txt, requirements.txt), environment variables (implied via paths), and executing system commands.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'os.system' command to delete build artifacts and temporary files.",
  "flows": "No untrusted input flows into critical functions or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of variable names that appear obfuscated or randomly generated; execution of 'os.system' for directory cleanup, which can be risky if input is manipulated (though static here). The code reads files that could potentially be manipulated, but no external input appears to influence the cleanup command directly.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup procedures: reading version info, dependencies, and defining a custom command class that deletes build directories and files. The cleanup command is executed via 'os.system' with static arguments, which is common but could be dangerous if the arguments are influenced externally. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The use of exec() to run 'version.py' is typical in setup scripts, though it can be risky if 'version.py' is compromised, but no evidence of malicious intent is present. Overall, the code lacks suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a cleanup command. It does not contain malware, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior. The only potential concern is the use of 'os.system' for deletion commands, which is generally safe here but should be handled carefully. No indicators of malicious intent or supply chain attack are observed.",
