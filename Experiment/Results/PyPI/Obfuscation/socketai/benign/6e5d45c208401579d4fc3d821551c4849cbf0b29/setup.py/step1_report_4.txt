  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that reads version info, dependencies, and defines a custom clean command.",
  "sources": "Reading version.py, requirements-test.txt, requirements.txt; executing version.py; command to remove build artifacts",
  "sinks": "os.system call to delete directories/files, reading files that could contain input data",
  "flows": "Reading version.py -> executing code; reading requirements files -> loading dependencies; executing os.system command -> deleting files/directories",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from version.py; dynamic string formatting for download_url; custom command executing system delete command; obfuscated variable names",
  "analysis": "The code reads version information from an external Python file using exec(), which could be risky if that file contains malicious code, although it is standard in setup scripts. It reads dependency lists from text files, which appears normal. The custom command class 'pKQwbgYEXaWDGWmJahEnKoBGWGoMsSFM' defines methods that are no-ops but includes a system call 'rm -vrf ...' to delete build artifacts, which could be exploited if misused. The setup() call assembles package metadata with obfuscated variable names and dynamically constructs the download URL. Overall, no direct malicious code is evident, but the use of exec() and destructive system commands are noteworthy.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs typical setup tasks with some obfuscated naming and use of exec() and system calls to remove files. The code does not exhibit clear malicious behavior but contains elements that, if manipulated, could pose security risks. The deletion command is a potential risk if misused or triggered unintentionally, but it is standard in build cleanup procedures.",
