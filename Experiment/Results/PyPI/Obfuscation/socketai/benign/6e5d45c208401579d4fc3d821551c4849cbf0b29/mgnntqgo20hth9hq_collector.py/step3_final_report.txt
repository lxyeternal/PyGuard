{
  "purpose": "The code functions as a static analysis and reverse engineering utility, focusing on symbol management, file path handling, ELF parsing, and pattern matching for source code analysis.",
  "sources": "File paths, symbol data, regex pattern matches, input files, and code snippets read during analysis routines.",
  "sinks": "No malicious sinks such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system sabotage are present; data flows are confined within analysis functions and file operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files and code snippets into internal data structures, symbol tables, and pattern matching routines, typical for static analysis tools.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names, complex regex patterns, and nested functions suggest code concealment but are consistent with analysis or reverse engineering purposes rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and complexity, employing regex parsing, symbol management, and file path manipulations. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or sabotage is detected. The purpose aligns with static analysis or reverse engineering tools, which often use obfuscation to hinder reverse engineering. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), reflecting the variable naming and regex complexity. The security risk remains low (~0.2), given the absence of active malicious functions. Confidence in these conclusions is high (~0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate static analysis or reverse engineering utility with heavy obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior. The assigned scores are consistent with its purpose and structure. No adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
