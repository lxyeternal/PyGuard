  "conclusion": "The code functions as a binary analysis utility with obfuscation, posing no active malicious threat but with potential misuse if inputs are not sanitized. The low malware score is appropriate; high obfuscation is justified; moderate risk warrants cautious use, especially regarding input validation."
