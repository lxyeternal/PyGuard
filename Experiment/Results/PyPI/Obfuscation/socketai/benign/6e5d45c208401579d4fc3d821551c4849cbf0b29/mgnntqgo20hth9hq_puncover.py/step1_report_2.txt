  "purpose": "The script appears to analyze C/C++ build output files for code size, static variables, and stack usage, and serves a web interface for this analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (e.g., 'WERKZEUG_RUN_MAIN'), command-line arguments, and checks for executable paths and socket connectivity.",
  "sinks": "Opens a web browser, starts a Flask web server, and performs socket connection checks.",
  "flows": "Input from command-line args and environment variables → socket check and file paths → web server setup and browser launch.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, and runtime path manipulations. No hardcoded secrets or credentials found. The code checks for port availability before starting a server, which is normal. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a build analysis tool for C/C++ projects, with a Flask server to present results, and performs environment and path checks. All operations appear to be benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or data leaks. The obfuscation is limited to variable names, possibly to hinder straightforward reading but not indicative of malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The socket check is a common pattern to avoid port conflicts. Overall, the code is consistent with a legitimate analysis tool.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build analysis utility that sets up a web interface for viewing C/C++ build output metrics. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation of variable names suggests an attempt to hinder readability but does not imply malicious intent.",
