  "reasoning": "The code exhibits heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive variable and function names, complex regex and dynamic HTML/URL generation, and data flows from untrusted sources into templates and redirects. No active malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation could be used to hide malicious intent, but in the absence of concrete malicious behavior, the low malware score (0.2) is appropriate. The obfuscation score (0.75) reflects the significant complexity and lack of clarity. The moderate risk score (0.5) accounts for potential injection vulnerabilities and misuse due to dynamic content handling, but no active exploits are detected.",
