{
  "purpose": "The code manages cookies, interacts with Bing chat/image APIs, and handles responses, including loading and parsing JSON data, managing session tokens, and performing API requests asynchronously.",
  "sources": "Cookie JSON files, class attributes, environment variables, user input prompts, external modules, and response data from API calls.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Bing services, file I/O for cookies and images, logging outputs, and response parsing functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from cookie files and user prompts into API request functions, with responses processed and stored in class attributes, and images saved to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive class and variable names, complex property methods, extensive debug logging, and external dependencies with obscure names; no explicit malicious code such as data exfiltration or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, making static analysis challenging. It appears to be a wrapper or client for Bing chat/image services, managing cookies, prompts, and responses asynchronously. No signs of malicious payloads, data theft, or sabotage are evident. The obfuscation and external dependencies could be used to conceal malicious intent, but static indicators do not confirm this. The complex response parsing and debug verbosity are suspicious but not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, obfuscated API client for Bing services with no explicit malicious activity detected. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but static analysis alone does not reveal malware. The malware score is set to 0.2, the obfuscation score to 0.8, and the overall security risk to 0.4, reflecting moderate concern primarily due to obfuscation. Dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment.",
