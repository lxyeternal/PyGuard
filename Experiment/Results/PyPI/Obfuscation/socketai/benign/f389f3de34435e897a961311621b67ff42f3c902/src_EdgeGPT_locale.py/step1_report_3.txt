{
  "purpose": "Define an enum class containing geographical location data for various regions, with optional type annotations for region codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data embedded within enum class attributes and type annotations for optional region codes.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or data flows leading to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The code defines static data; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The enum attributes contain detailed geographical data, which is unusual for an enum; no code executes or processes this data. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules, defines an enum class with attributes containing geographical data, and defines an optional union type for regional codes. The data appears to be static, well-structured, and not dynamic or influenced by external input. There are no obfuscated or malicious code constructs, no network activity, and no functions performing sensitive operations. The code is typical for defining configuration or constants, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a static definition of location-related data using an enum class. It does not include malicious code, backdoors, or security risks. No vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
