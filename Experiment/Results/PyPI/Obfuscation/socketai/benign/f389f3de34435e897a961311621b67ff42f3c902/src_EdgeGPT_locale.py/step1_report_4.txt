  "purpose": "Define an Enum class containing geographic location data with multiple locale-specific dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Imports from enum and typing modules; Enum class attributes containing location data dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks or untrusted data output; no external network or system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code only defines data structures and type hints.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class name; location data are hardcoded, but no secrets or credentials present. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an enumeration class with multiple attributes, each storing a dictionary of geographic info for different locales. It includes conditional import for typing extensions, which is standard practice. No user input handling, no network communication, and no code that executes dynamically or alters system state. The location data appears static and benign, used for configuration or geolocation purposes. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The variable 'mbbrJeEaNqSAyDTpZJyNczoVGvgtNFZa' is a type alias for optional union types, not malicious. Overall, the code is a data structure definition with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign data definition module containing geographic data within an enum class. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It appears intended for configuration or localization purposes without any malicious payloads.",
