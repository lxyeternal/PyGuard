  "purpose": "Defines an Enum class with geographic location data for various regions, including coordinates and locale info.",
  "sources": "Constant dictionaries within the Enum class holding location data.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks; no external data output or network activity present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; data is statically defined within class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and variable names, but no malicious behavior is apparent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code features are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with multiple geographic location dictionaries, each representing different regions with static data. The import statements handle type annotations, including compatibility imports. The variable names are obfuscated, but their content is benign. There is no dynamic execution, network activity, or credential handling. No malicious or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated data container for geographic information with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
