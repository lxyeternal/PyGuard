{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration with location-related data for different regions and a type alias for optional location information.",
  "sources": "Imports modules and defines constants with location data; no external data sources or user input are used.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or output sensitive information.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; data structures are static and predefined.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated class and variable names; location data is hardcoded, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no code execution, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, with a fallback import for typing extensions. It defines an Enum class containing dictionaries with location info for various regions, using cryptic variable names. The type alias 'mbbrJeEaNqSAyDTpZJyNczoVGvgtNFZa' is an Optional Union of the Enum and specific string literals representing countries. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or sensitive operations are present. The code appears to serve as configuration or static data storage. The obfuscated variable and class names may suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily static data definitions with obfuscated naming. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. The obfuscation may hinder readability but does not imply malicious intent.",
