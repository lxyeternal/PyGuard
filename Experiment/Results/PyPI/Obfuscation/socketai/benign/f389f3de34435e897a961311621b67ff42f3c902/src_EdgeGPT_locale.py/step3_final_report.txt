{
  "purpose": "Defines static geographic location data within an Enum class and a type alias for optional location info.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionaries within class attributes, no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; static data with no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; data is static and does not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; no malicious code or dynamic behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static dictionaries representing geographic locations, stored within an Enum class with obfuscated identifiers. There is no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling involving untrusted sources. The obfuscation may be intended to conceal internal details but does not imply malicious intent. No signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present. The static nature and benign content suggest configuration or localization purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration module with obfuscated naming, showing no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The obfuscation warrants attention but does not constitute a security risk. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's static, benign nature.",
