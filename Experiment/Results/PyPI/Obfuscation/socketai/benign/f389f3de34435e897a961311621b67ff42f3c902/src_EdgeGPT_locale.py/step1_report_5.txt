{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration of location data with associated geographic information and a type alias for optional location identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data definitions within Enum members and imports for typing hints.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources or data sinks are present; no data is being transmitted or written.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only defines static constants.",
  "anomalies": "The Enum members contain large static dictionaries with location data but no suspicious or malicious content. The use of obfuscated variable and class names is unusual but not inherently malicious. The type alias indicates optional union of enums and literals but does not process or transmit data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class derived from Enum, with members holding geographic location data as static dictionaries. It includes a fallback import for typing extensions, which is standard. The data appears to be hardcoded geographic coordinates for various locations. There are no functions, data handling, network operations, or external input/output mechanisms present. The naming conventions are obfuscated, which is suspicious but can also be a stylistic choice. Overall, the code only establishes static data structures with no active malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines static location data using an Enum and a type alias. It contains no malicious behavior, no data leaks, no network communication, and no suspicious code execution. The obfuscated naming is unusual but not malicious. There are no signs of supply chain attacks or malware.",
