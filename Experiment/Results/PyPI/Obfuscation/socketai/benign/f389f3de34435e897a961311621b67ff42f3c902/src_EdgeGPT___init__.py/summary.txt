  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the high scores assigned to Report 3 are justified by multiple malicious indicators, while other reports are benign or incomplete, warranting low scores. The overall scoring is consistent with the evidence, supporting the conclusion that the supply chain risk is primarily driven by the malicious code identified in Report 3."
