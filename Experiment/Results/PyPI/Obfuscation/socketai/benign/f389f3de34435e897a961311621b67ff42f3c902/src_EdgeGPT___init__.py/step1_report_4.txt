  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a data processing or utility function, but the specific purpose cannot be conclusively determined due to lack of context and incomplete code snippets.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, function parameters, or external files (exact sources unspecified due to incomplete code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but specifics are unclear without full code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through various functions and possibly to sinks such as network or file system operations. Exact paths are indeterminate due to incomplete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious obfuscation. No unusual code constructs detected from provided snippets. Lack of context limits thorough anomaly detection.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is incomplete, limiting detailed analysis. No evidence of malicious functions such as network exfiltration, system modification, or credential theft. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code injection are evident. The code structure does not suggest hidden backdoors or malicious behavior. Due to limited snippet, confidence in the detection is moderate, and more context is needed for a definitive assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no clear indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but the incomplete nature warrants cautious review if more code exists.",
