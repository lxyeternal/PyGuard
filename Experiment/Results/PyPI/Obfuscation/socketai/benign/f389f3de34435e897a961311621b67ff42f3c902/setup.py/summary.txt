  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup with obfuscation and embedded secrets. While no malicious activity is directly observed, the obfuscation and presence of secrets increase suspicion. The scores reflect moderate risk primarily due to potential secret exposure and concealment tactics. Further investigation is recommended to confirm whether the embedded strings are benign placeholders or sensitive credentials. The overall security posture is cautious but not definitively malicious."
