  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named RmkVhbBmrMShVwbawfTmdeCHswofsmWR.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code solely defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears as a nonsensical, obfuscated string. No other code functionality or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of a single class definition inheriting from Exception, with an obfuscated class name. There are no functions, data handling, or executable code. The class name's obfuscation could be intended to hide its purpose, but without additional context or code, it appears as a superficial naming choice rather than malicious code. No input, data processing, or suspicious activities are visible.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a minimal, single-line class definition for a custom exception with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security risks within this snippet. It appears as a benign placeholder or a component of a larger codebase.",
