  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named RmkVhbBmrMShVwbawfTmdeCHswofsmWR.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs read by this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths, as the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no functional anomaly besides the unusual name.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition inheriting from Exception, with a non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated class name. There are no data inputs, no functions, and no logic. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are evident. The class could be used as a custom exception for a larger project, but in isolation, it shows no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, harmless custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. It appears to be a simple component of a larger codebase, with no security risks in this snippet.",
