  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, likely as a placeholder or for future extension.",
  "sources": "Class declaration; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows; class is a simple inheritance with no methods or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name; no additional logic or behavior; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class inheriting from Exception with an obfuscated name. No data sources, sinks, or flows are present. The class contains no methods or logic, indicating benign intent. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not imply malicious activity in isolation. Scores assigned in reports (malware 0, securityRisk 0, obfuscated 0.8-1, confidence 0.9-1) are consistent with the code's simplicity and obfuscation. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal class definition with an obfuscated name. The high obfuscation score reflects the class name's nonsensical nature, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, and scores are appropriate. No further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
