  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition, likely intended for specific error handling.",
  "sources": "No data input or external sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs involved.",
  "flows": "No data flow, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and its name suggest obfuscation or an intentionally complex, non-descriptive identifier. The class name appears to be a random string, which can be suspicious if it were used maliciously. No other code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception with a complex, seemingly random name. There are no data flows, no external inputs, or outputs, and no behaviors that indicate malicious activity. The class is a standard Python pattern for defining custom exceptions, but the choice of name could indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide the purpose. Overall, the code is minimal and harmless in isolation.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, standard Python class definition for a custom exception with an unusual name. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks by itself. The unusual class name could be for obfuscation, but on its own, it poses no security concern.",
