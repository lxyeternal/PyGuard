  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named RmkVhbBmrMShVwbawfTmdeCHswofsmWR.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leak or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this code only declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "Class name is obfuscated and does not reflect meaningful intent; no other suspicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single class declaration for a custom exception with an obfuscated class name. There are no data inputs, external calls, or hidden behaviors. The class itself is harmless, serving as a custom exception placeholder. The obfuscated name could be an attempt to evade detection, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign class definition with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malware or security risks in this fragment.",
