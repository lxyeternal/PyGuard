  "purpose": "Static configuration module defining an Enum with feature flag lists and a type alias for optional union types.",
  "sources": "Class variables containing lists of strings representing configuration options; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; static data only.",
  "flows": "N/A — static data definitions; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no malicious code or dynamic execution detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration module with obfuscated naming, containing lists of feature flags and a type alias. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The obfuscation is likely stylistic or for code organization, not malicious. No signs of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is moderate but justified; risk is minimal. Minor adjustment could be lowering the risk score in report 3 from 0.2 to 0, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration component with obfuscated naming but no malicious intent or security risks. The scores across reports are consistent and appropriate, with only minor potential adjustments for risk scoring in one report.",
