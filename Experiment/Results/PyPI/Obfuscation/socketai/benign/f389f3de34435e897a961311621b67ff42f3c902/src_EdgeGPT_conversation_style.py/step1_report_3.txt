{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class with multiple preset lists of strings and a type alias for optional union of the enum or specific string literals.",
  "sources": "Imports modules (enum, typing), defines class and variables",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is purely defining constants and types",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class name, but this appears to be a simple, non-malicious pattern of defining constants; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code found",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines an Enum with three members each containing lists of strings, and a type alias with Optional and Union. The content appears to be configuration constants, possibly for feature toggles or policies. There are no dynamic inputs, network calls, or suspicious behavior. The naming pattern of the class and variables is obfuscated but consistent with non-malicious code. No suspicious data handling, code injection, or malware indicators are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign definition of constants and types, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
