{
  "purpose": "The code defines an enumeration class with predefined string lists and a type alias for optional, union, or literal types related to the enum.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the enum class definitions and the type alias assignment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system behavior or leaks.",
  "flows": "The type alias allows data to flow from potentially external inputs into the type system, but no actual data processing or input handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be part of a larger codebase or configuration, with no executable logic, external data handling, or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum with several class variables containing string lists, likely representing configuration or options. It also defines a type alias that permits optional or union types, including specific string literals. There are no functions, input/output operations, or security-sensitive actions. The structure is consistent with typical configuration or constants code and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign definition of constants and type aliases, possibly for configuration purposes. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident.",
