  "purpose": "Define an enum class with several predefined string lists and an optional type alias for various string options.",
  "sources": "Import statements for Enum and typing modules; enum class definitions with string lists; type alias with optional and union types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted input. The code merely defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, defines an Enum with three members, each holding lists of string literals, and creates a type alias for optional union types involving the enum or specific strings. No external input handling, no network or file I/O, and no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The code appears to be a static data definition without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration or constant definitions. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. No indicators of malicious intent or obfuscation are present.",
