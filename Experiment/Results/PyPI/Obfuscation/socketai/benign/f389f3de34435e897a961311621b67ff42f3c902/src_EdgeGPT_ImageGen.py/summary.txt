  "malware_score": 0.4,
  "security_risk": 0.45,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code employs obfuscation and indirect function invocation, which are common indicators of malicious intent or backdoors, but no direct evidence of malicious activity is present. The pattern suggests caution, and further analysis of the external module is necessary. The scores should reflect moderate suspicion, with a malware score around 0.4 and a risk score near 0.45. Overall, the code should be treated as potentially malicious until verified."
