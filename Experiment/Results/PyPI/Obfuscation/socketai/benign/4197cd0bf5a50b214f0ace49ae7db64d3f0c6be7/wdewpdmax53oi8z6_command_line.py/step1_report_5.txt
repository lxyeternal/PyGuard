  "purpose": "This script appears to be a command-line interface for a bioinformatics or data analysis pipeline related to cell type prediction, model management, and result visualization.",
  "sources": "Input parameters via command-line options and external files (e.g., input data files, model files, directories).",
  "sinks": "File system operations (directory checks, file existence), model loading, and printing logs or messages to the console.",
  "flows": "Input data and configuration parameters are processed, validated, and then used to run analysis functions, generate outputs, and display information.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated string in `show_banner()` with a complex identifier, which seems like an attempt to hide the banner message. No hardcoded credentials or secret keys are evident. No dynamic code execution or suspicious network activity is apparent. The code uses standard libraries and appears to follow normal command-line tool patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles CLI options, validates input files/directories, loads models, and orchestrates analysis workflows. The obfuscated string in the banner is the main anomaly, but it does not indicate malicious behavior. No code injections, network communications, or harmful operations are present. The code structure suggests it is a typical CLI wrapper for data analysis, with no evident backdoors or malicious logic. The only potentially suspicious element is the obfuscated banner string, which could be a hiding attempt, but it is merely a decorative message. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for scientific data processing.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard command-line wrapper for a bioinformatics pipeline with no malicious behavior detected. The obfuscated string in the banner is suspicious but likely just aesthetic or branding. No evidence of malware or security risks was found. The overall security risk is low.",
