  "purpose": "Import modules and submodules with obfuscated names, set a version string.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from current package with obfuscated module names.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data flows observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely import statements and a string assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated module names (e.g., pNXJRhNezfTHMFOReigergVLwmwiNrft) and variables. No descriptive names or comments. No evident malicious behavior, but obfuscation may hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules with non-descriptive, obfuscated names, and a version string assignment. There is no evident malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The obfuscation could be benign, serving to protect intellectual property or reduce readability. Alternatively, it might be hiding malicious intent. No external input is processed, and no suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard module import statements with obfuscated identifiers. No clear malicious activity is observed, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Overall, the code does not show signs of malware or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
