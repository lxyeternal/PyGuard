{
  "purpose": "The code is a set of import statements from obfuscated internal modules and a version string assignment, likely part of a larger package or obfuscated codebase.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules with obfuscated names and a version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network activity, or data leaks are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only imports modules and assigns a version string; no data flows or execution paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated module names that do not reveal their purpose, which could be a red flag but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static import statements with obfuscated module names and a version string. No runtime behavior, data processing, or network activity is present. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious, but without further context, it remains a suspicion. The lack of malicious indicators such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network connections suggests low likelihood of malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute evidence of malware. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0-0.2, obfuscation: 0.7-0.9, risk: 0.2) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a minimal, obfuscated import block with no malicious activity or security risks evident. The high obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious. The current scores are appropriate and do not require adjustment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
