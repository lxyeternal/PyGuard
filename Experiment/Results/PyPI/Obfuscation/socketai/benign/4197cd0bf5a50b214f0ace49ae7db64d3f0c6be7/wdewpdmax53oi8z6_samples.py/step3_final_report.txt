{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for managing file paths and sampling cells from an AnnData object, with options for balancing cell types.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as file names and cell type labels; accesses AnnData object attributes like obs and n_obs.",
  "sinks": "Returns sampled indices or subsets of AnnData; no external data transmission or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., n_cells, by) influence sampling logic; sampled indices are returned or used to subset data.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; suspicious or malformed numpy function call `np.cNOItjkXBKNYniYhwbTjsJpKxHZqsbNY`; emojis in error messages; inconsistent code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code manages data paths and performs sampling with validation. Obfuscated names hinder readability but do not inherently imply malicious intent. The suspicious numpy function suggests obfuscation or typo, raising suspicion. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification detected. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment. The core logic is typical for data sampling utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign utility code with superficial obfuscation. The suspicious function name warrants further review, but no definitive malicious activity is present. The malware score is low (0.2), obfuscation is high (0.75), and overall security risk is moderate (0.4). Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment in sensitive contexts.",
