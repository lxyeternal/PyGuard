  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign utility code with superficial obfuscation. The suspicious function name warrants further review, but no definitive malicious activity is present. The malware score is low (0.2), obfuscation is high (0.75), and overall security risk is moderate (0.4). Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment in sensitive contexts."
