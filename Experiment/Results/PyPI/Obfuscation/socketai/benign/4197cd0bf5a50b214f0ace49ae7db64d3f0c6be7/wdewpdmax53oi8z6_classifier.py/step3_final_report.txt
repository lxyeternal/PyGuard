  "purpose": "A comprehensive pipeline for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis, including data loading, normalization, PCA, clustering, visualization, and cell type prediction.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files or AnnData objects, including expression matrices, gene annotations, and cell metadata.",
  "sinks": "Outputs predicted labels, decision matrices, probability matrices, and visualization plots; no external data exfiltration or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input files or objects through normalization, PCA, neighbor graph construction, clustering, and prediction steps, with results stored back into AnnData object and saved as files.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names, suppression of warnings, optional GPU acceleration, but no malicious code, network calls, or backdoors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard bioinformatics workflows for single-cell analysis, with obfuscation likely for proprietary protection rather than malicious intent. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, and the logic aligns with legitimate analysis pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated single-cell RNA-seq analysis pipeline with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation is superficial and likely intended for code protection. Security risks are minimal, primarily related to input validation and obfuscation, not malicious sabotage.",
