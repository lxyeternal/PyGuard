  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'celltypist' Python package, reading metadata from files and configuring package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'celltypist/__init__.py' files; calls external functions 'get_version()', 'get_readme()', 'get_requirements()'.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is sent or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "Reads static files and passes data to setuptools.setup(), with no dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names; missing definitions for 'get_version()', 'get_readme()', and 'get_requirements()' suggest incomplete code or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. It reads static files for metadata and configures installation via setuptools. No network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation is limited to naming and does not conceal malicious intent. Missing function definitions are likely external or omitted, not inherently malicious. The overall structure and behavior are benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the missing functions should be verified in the full codebase for completeness.",
