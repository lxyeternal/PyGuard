{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and configure a Python package named 'celltypist', including reading necessary files and defining package metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'celltypist/__init__.py' files from the local filesystem.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setuptools.setup' to process and potentially execute code related to package installation; no external data sinks or network connections observed.",
  "flows": "Reads data from files (sources), processes or extracts specific information (e.g., version string), and passes configuration data to 'setuptools.setup' (sink).",
  "anomalies": "The functions 'get_version()', 'get_readme()', and 'get_requirements()' are called but are not defined within this code snippet, implying missing or external definitions. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present. The code's obfuscation seems minimal, using meaningless function names but straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads static files and sets up package metadata using setuptools. The functions with obfuscated names seem to serve simple file reading purposes. There are no network connections, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious data handling observed. The missing definitions for 'get_version()', 'get_readme()', and 'get_requirements()' could suggest incomplete code, but they do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated function names but no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated function names but no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The absence of external communications, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious operations indicates a low likelihood of malicious intent.",
