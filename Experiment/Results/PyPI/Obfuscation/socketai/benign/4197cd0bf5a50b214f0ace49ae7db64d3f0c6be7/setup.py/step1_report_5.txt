{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for the 'celltypist' Python package, defining functions to read files and configure package installation.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'celltypist/__init__.py' files.",
  "sinks": "Uses the retrieved data for package setup; no untrusted data directly influences runtime behavior or external systems.",
  "flows": "File reading functions are called during setup to gather metadata and requirements; data flows into the setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like variable names and dynamic content retrieval functions; potential for hiding malicious intent, but no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles package setup: reading README and requirements files, extracting version info from '__init__.py', and configuring setuptools.setup(). No external input influences runtime execution beyond initial file reads. Variable names are obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to obscure code intent; however, the logic appears standard for Python package setup scripts. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious data handling is present. Functions are simple file readers with no dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or external calls beyond local file access.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a typical Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. No malware or malicious activity detected.",
