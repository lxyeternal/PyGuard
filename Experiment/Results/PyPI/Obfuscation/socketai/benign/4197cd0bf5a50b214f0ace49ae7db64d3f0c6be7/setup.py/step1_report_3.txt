{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package named 'celltypist' with metadata and entry points, reading version, requirements, and README content from files.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md', 'requirements.txt', and 'celltypist/__init__.py' files",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data is directly written or executed",
  "flows": "Reads data from files, uses functions to supply package metadata to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "The functions for reading files are obfuscated with unusual variable names, but perform standard file I/O; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and defines functions to read README, requirements, and version info from files with obfuscated variable names. It then calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, using these functions to supply data. All file operations are straightforward. No dynamic code execution, network access, or suspicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard setup script for packaging a Python project, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior. No malware indicators or security risks detected.",
