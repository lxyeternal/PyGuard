  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, managing dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads package files using the 'read' function, which reads from the filesystem based on the script's directory.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'setup()' to define package installation and metadata; no untrusted data handling or network operations evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from filesystem reads to package metadata configuration; no data flows into untrusted sinks or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names with seemingly random strings, but no malicious code functionality detected. The code is primarily standard setup logic.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules, defines a file-reading function, and calls 'setup()' with package metadata and requirements. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code performs typical package setup tasks without anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks detected based on the provided content.",
