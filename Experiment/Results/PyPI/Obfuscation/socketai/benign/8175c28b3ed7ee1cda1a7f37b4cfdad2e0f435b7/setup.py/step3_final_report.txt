  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package distribution.",
  "sources": "Filesystem read operation for setup files, package metadata parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network activity, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading files to populate setup parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, unconventional parameter names in setup(), no comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt to hide complexity but does not perform any malicious actions. It reads files from the filesystem and calls setup() with package info, dependencies, and metadata. No network activity, dynamic code execution, or secret handling is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not evidence of malicious intent. The code's behavior aligns with benign package configuration scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation appears to be a concealment tactic rather than malicious sabotage. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscation score is approximately 0.7, and the security risk score is low at 0.2, consistent with the analysis.",
