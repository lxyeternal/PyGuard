  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package that imports specific classes or functions from local modules and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .impl and .types",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output involved",
  "flows": "Imports do not involve data flow from external sources; they simply bring in internal components",
  "anomalies": "Imports are of obfuscated-looking identifiers which could be used to hide malicious intent, but in this context, they are likely just obfuscated names or placeholders. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes/functions with non-descriptive, obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious components. However, the structure is typical for a Python module that defines its public API via __all__. There are no suspicious functions, data leaks, or security-sensitive operations. The code is minimal and does not include any network activity, data handling, or dynamic code execution. The obfuscated names could suggest code obfuscation, but without additional context, this is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this snippet, the code functions as a standard module with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
