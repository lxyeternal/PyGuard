{
  "purpose": "This code appears to import specific classes or functions from local modules and defines an export list for a package or module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .impl and .types",
  "sinks": "No evident untrusted data handling, user input, or data leaks present in the code",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements do not constitute data flow pathways",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from relative modules with intentionally obfuscated names, possibly to obscure the code's purpose. The __all__ list exposes three names: 'SumType', 'Either', 'Maybe', which are common in functional programming paradigms. The lack of additional logic, data processing, or network activity suggests this is a typical module setup. The obfuscated import names could be part of an intentionally obscured codebase, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution, network connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with obfuscated internal identifiers. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based solely on these import statements and the export list. The obfuscation of imported identifiers is unusual but not malicious.",
