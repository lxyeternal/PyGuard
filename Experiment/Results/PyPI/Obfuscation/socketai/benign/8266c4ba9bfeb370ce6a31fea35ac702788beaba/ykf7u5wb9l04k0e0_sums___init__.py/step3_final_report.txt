{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module that imports specific components from internal modules, with an __all__ list defining exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .impl and .types",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, external network activity, or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports from internal modules; no data flow from external sources or untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers in imported names; minimal code structure; absence of dynamic or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal module setup with obfuscated import names, which could be auto-generated or intentionally obscured. No evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive without further context. The malware score should be 0, as no malicious intent is evident. The obfuscated score is high (~0.7) due to the naming, and the security risk score remains low (~0.2) given the lack of active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal module with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities in this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall risk remains low.",
