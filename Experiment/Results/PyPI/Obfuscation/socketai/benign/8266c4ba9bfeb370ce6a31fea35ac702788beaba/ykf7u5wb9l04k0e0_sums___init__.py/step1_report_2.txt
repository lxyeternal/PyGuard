  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from internal modules for use in the current package, and define public API exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.impl and .types)",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs static imports and defines __all__",
  "anomalies": "Unusual or obfuscated class/function names (AtaBPpiOsZGmGQErvhxvWwvXOykvXHKf, sreZEVJQdbMHBiQrlYmtcFRtCFjfCDsD, ztGlWQxDecpSQcwiizMJBMwLoleyMezQ) suggest obfuscation or generated code; no comments or documentation; no dynamic code execution or input handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules and an explicit __all__ definition for public API. The imported identifiers are highly obfuscated, which could indicate code obfuscation or auto-generated code, possibly to hide malicious intent. There are no sources of untrusted data, no sinks performing external communication, and no apparent data flows. The code itself is minimal and doesn't perform any operations beyond imports and exports.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module setup with obfuscated identifiers, possibly part of a larger obfuscated codebase or intentionally obscured. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity in this fragment. The obfuscated naming warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity on its own.",
