{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide utility functions for string normalization, type inspection, cloning objects, and dynamic function creation, likely as part of a larger type validation or schema framework.",
  "sources": "Reading input strings in FKoHHbqGyIuojvlysMBYZzMafTpJKgXQ; inspecting classes and objects via hasattr, getattr, and type annotations; retrieving current frame for scope inspection.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe use of eval or dynamic object creation in UDPoGNTVZhGGtHObrOyTQwQoujbbDXMV; scope manipulation via inspect and dynamic attribute access; exception raising that could leak info.",
  "flows": "Input string processed in FKoHHbqGyIuojvlysMBYZzMafTpJKgXQ, then potentially passed to functions involving dynamic attribute access and class cloning, possibly leading to code execution if external data is involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names; dynamic code and reflection-based operations; questionable exception messages revealing internal details; use of regex in normalization, but no evidence of malicious pattern matching.",
  "analysis": "The code relies heavily on dynamic attribute inspection, string normalization, and object cloning. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or network activity are present. No suspicious data leaks, cryptomining, or reverse shells detected. The use of reflection and dynamic scope could be misused if external inputs are uncontrolled, but within this code, it functions as standard dynamic typing and object handling. No obfuscated code or malicious behavior detected. The functions seem consistent with schema validation or type handling frameworks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for handling dynamic types, cloning, and scope inspection within a schema or validation framework. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The security risk is low, but the heavy use of reflection and dynamic attribute access warrants careful input validation in the larger context.",
