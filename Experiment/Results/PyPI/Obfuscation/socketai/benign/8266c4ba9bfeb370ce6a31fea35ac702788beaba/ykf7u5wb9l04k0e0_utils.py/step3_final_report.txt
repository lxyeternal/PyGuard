{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for string normalization, type inspection, cloning, and dynamic function retrieval, likely used within schema validation or data processing frameworks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions such as strings, types, and scope objects; attribute access via reflection and inspection modules.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic attribute access, cloning, and scope inspection that could lead to data leakage or code execution if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions via parameters, then through reflection, attribute access, and dynamic object creation, potentially leading to security-sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names, complex reflection, dynamic scope handling, and suspicious import paths suggest obfuscation or concealment; no explicit malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions that heavily rely on reflection, dynamic attribute access, and scope inspection. While these are common in schema validation and meta-programming, they can be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No network activity, file manipulation, or payloads are present. The obfuscated variable names and import paths increase suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The functions appear legitimate but should be used with caution, especially regarding input validation and scope control.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely a legitimate utility module with potential for misuse if inputs are malicious. No definitive malware or malicious activity is detected, but the obfuscation and dynamic features warrant cautious review in broader contexts.",
