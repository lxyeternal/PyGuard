  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.flags, .sums, .custom_types), nested modules (.combinator.constructor, .schema.errors).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static import statements only.",
  "flows": "Importing cryptic identifiers from modules, setting __all__ for exports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, non-descriptive identifiers for imported functions/classes; no documentation or comments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, indicating either auto-generated or intentionally obscured code. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data processing is present. The obfuscated names raise suspicion but are not evidence of malicious intent. The absence of code logic or data flow reduces risk. The consistent low malware scores across reports align with this static analysis. The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but do not confirm malicious behavior. Further review of the imported modules' implementations is recommended to rule out hidden malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module interface setup with obfuscated identifiers. No active malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet. The obfuscation warrants further review of the imported components, but based solely on this code, the overall security risk is low.",
