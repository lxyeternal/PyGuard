  "purpose": "Module initialization and exporting specific components for external use.",
  "sources": "No untrusted input sources or external data reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file, or environment variable manipulations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only sets up imports and exports.",
  "anomalies": "Import names like 'kyiIQdDFCItTVClNvHRLwjLzeQEnuSkF' and 'nahJRwzNtMOOgNErHjwLrvXDLiPYFSOo' are unusual, potentially obfuscated or autogenerated. The use of such obscure identifiers may be suspicious but could also be code obfuscation or code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily re-exports components from internal modules, which is standard practice for Python packages. The import of notably obfuscated or non-descriptive names ('kyiIQdDFCItTVClNvHRLwjLzeQEnuSkF', 'nahJRwzNtMOOgNErHjwLrvXDLiPYFSOo') is unusual and warrants attention; however, it does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No external data handling, network access, or dynamic code execution is present. The code structure appears consistent with typical package setup, albeit with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical module export pattern, with some suspiciously obfuscated or autogenerated import names. There is no direct evidence of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
