{
  "purpose": "The code determines the Python version at runtime and conditionally imports a type from either typing_extensions or typing based on the version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info is read to check the Python version.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; imports are static and based on version check.",
  "flows": "Source (sys.version_info) influences the import statement, which is static and determined at runtime but does not lead to data leak or malicious action.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses an obfuscated variable name (hpJpNZDhAJWzQQoahCRMIKbNhJghJewD), which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present.",
  "analysis": "The script checks the current Python version and conditionally imports a type from either typing_extensions or typing. The variable name for the version info is deliberately obfuscated, which is unusual but not malicious. The import logic is standard, based on version compatibility. There are no input/output flows that could be exploited, and no dynamic code execution or network activity. The code appears to be a version compatibility shim with obfuscated variable naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and standard for compatibility handling, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The only notable aspect is the obfuscated variable name, which is not malicious but could be considered unusual.",
