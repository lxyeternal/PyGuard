  "purpose": "The code determines the Python version and imports a specific type extension accordingly, then defines public symbols.",

  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code performs a straightforward version check and import",
  "analysis": "The script imports sys to access Python version info. It then slices version tuple to get major and minor versions. Based on whether the version is below Python 3.8, it conditionally imports 'QSmXaPYReujHPZMieasaaHIyXUZxOqLG' from either typing_extensions or typing. The import is used to support type annotations, and the __all__ defines exported symbols. There are no hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or network activity. The code appears to be a standard version compatibility check and import, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple compatibility check and import, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
