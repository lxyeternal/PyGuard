  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version detection",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exposed",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> conditional import",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated variable name (hpJpNZDhAJWzQQoahCRMIKbNhJghJewD) and a seemingly arbitrary import based on Python version, but no malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the Python version info and uses a conditional to import a type from either typing_extensions or typing depending on the version. The variable name used to store the version info appears intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward and standard for compatibility. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated variable name, which does not impact security but might suggest code hiding or obfuscation. No external network activity, data leakage, or malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a version compatibility utility with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The obfuscation seems superficial and does not suggest malicious intent.",
