  "purpose": "The code determines the Python version at runtime and conditionally imports a specific type from either typing_extensions or typing modules.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for obtaining Python version",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations",
  "flows": "sys.version_info flows to the version comparison, leading to conditional import from typing_extensions or typing",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names; conditional import based on Python version is common, but no suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The script retrieves the Python interpreter's version info, compares it to 3.8, and imports QSmXaPYReujHPZMieasaaHIyXUZxOqLG from either typing_extensions or typing accordingly. The code is straightforward, with obfuscation only in variable naming, which does not indicate malicious intent. No data leaks, network operations, or malicious payloads are present. It appears to be a simple compatibility shim.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs version checking and conditional importing without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard pattern to maintain compatibility across Python versions, with no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
