  "purpose": "The code determines Python version and conditionally imports a type extension or typing feature based on the version.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version; import statements for typing_extensions or typing modules",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external data sources are used",
  "flows": "Python version check flows into conditional import, no data flows from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which is unusual and may obscure intent, but no malicious actions are evident",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python interpreter version using sys.version_info. If the version is below 3.8, it imports QSmXaPYReujHPZMieasaaHIyXUZxOqLG from typing_extensions; otherwise, from typing. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the functionality is straightforward and standard. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide simple version checks but does not introduce malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a benign Python version check and conditional import based on the version. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks.",
