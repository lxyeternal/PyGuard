      "conclusion": "The script is a standard, obfuscated Python package setup file with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact the benign nature of the code. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0.7, and the overall security risk is low at 0.2. These scores are consistent with the analysis and justified given the code's behavior."

There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation is likely for internal reasons or to hinder reverse engineering but does not indicate malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
