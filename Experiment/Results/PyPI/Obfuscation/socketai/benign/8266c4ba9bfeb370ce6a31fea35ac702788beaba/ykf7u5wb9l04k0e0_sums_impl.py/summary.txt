  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, heavily obfuscated implementation of sum types and variant management, with no signs of malicious payloads or malicious intent. Its obfuscation level warrants caution, but static analysis indicates a low security threat. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
