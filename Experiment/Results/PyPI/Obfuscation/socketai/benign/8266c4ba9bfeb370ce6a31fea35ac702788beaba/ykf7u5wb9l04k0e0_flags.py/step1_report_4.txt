  "purpose": "Define configuration and utility classes, including a flag system and a lambda identity function.",
  "sources": "Input to the lambda function, class initializations, and attribute references.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data sinks or network operations.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from sources to sinks; classes are used for configuration purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class and variable names; the lambda function simply returns its input, which is benign. The class method `__call__` creates an instance of a NamedTuple with potentially sensitive data, but no direct malicious actions are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a NamedTuple and a class with obfuscated names, likely for configuration or internal use. The class methods are straightforward, with no suspicious side effects. The lambda function is an identity function. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are apparent. The code structure and variable names appear intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign configuration or utility setup with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in the provided fragment.",
