{
  "purpose": "Standard package setup script that reads dependencies, README, and configures metadata, with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "Files such as 'requirements/extras', 'README.rst'; filesystem reads for dependencies and documentation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into variables used for package configuration; no external or untrusted data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import statement, nonsensical variable and function names, dynamic dependency loading, superficial obfuscation intended to hinder readability.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks: reading dependencies, README, and setting package metadata. No network activity, code injection, or malicious system modifications are present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely to hinder readability rather than conceal malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. The code's behavior aligns with benign package configuration scripts. The obfuscation and dynamic path usage are suspicious but do not demonstrate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, obfuscated Python package setup file with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact the benign nature of the code. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0.7, and the overall security risk is low at 0.2. These scores are consistent with the analysis and justified given the code's behavior.",
