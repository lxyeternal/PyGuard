  "conclusion": "The script is a standard, obfuscated Python package setup file with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact the benign nature of the code. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0.7, and the overall security risk is low at 0.2. These scores are consistent with the analysis and justified given the code's behavior."
