  "purpose": "Define a typed immutable mapping and a named tuple with string attributes and a complex property type.",
  "sources": "Import statements, the pmap() call, and the class definition with string annotations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code primarily defines data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names, non-standard import 'NNSTVedNOFhanpSJHyFOQXouwslEERkm', and complex type annotations may suggest obfuscation or intentional concealment, but no malicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and types, defines a mapping 'ARPnSUSkDowYFFdEBnFobhhoVtkXpZIx' as an immutable persistent map with complex nested types, and creates a NamedTuple class with two string attributes and a complex property type. The variable names are intentionally obscure, which could hint at obfuscation, but the code's functionality appears to be just data structure definitions. There are no apparent malicious behaviors such as network operations, data exfiltration, or code injection. The use of complex type annotations and obscure identifiers does not inherently indicate malicious intent but could be an attempt to conceal purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be solely for defining data structures with complex types and obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this fragment. The obscure naming might be for obfuscation, but it does not imply malicious intent.",
