{
  "purpose": "Define a typed data structure using NamedTuple with some dependencies and an alias for an immutable map.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing, pyrsistent, and local module flags; uses variables and types from these modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks; no data output or external calls observed.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to local variables; the NamedTuple class is defined without external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses non-standard or obfuscated identifiers, such as NNSTVedNOFhanpSJHyFOQXouwslEERkm and dmCBYbYNWRBkvZOyIdvnDQojoGteYMJo, which appear intentionally obscure. No credentials, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code patterns are visible. The unusual naming may be intended to obfuscate intent but does not necessarily imply malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, then defines type aliases and a NamedTuple class with obfuscated attribute names. It also creates an empty persistent map. There are no external data sources, network calls, or suspicious logic. The unusual variable names could be a form of obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent, but without any active code or malicious actions, this appears benign. No indicators of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data structure definition with obfuscated identifiers, likely for internal or private use. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
