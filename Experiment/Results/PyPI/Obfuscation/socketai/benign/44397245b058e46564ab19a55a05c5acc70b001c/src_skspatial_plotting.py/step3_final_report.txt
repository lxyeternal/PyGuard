  "purpose": "Visualization functions for 2D and 3D spatial data plotting, including scatter plots and connecting lines.",
  "sources": "Function parameters providing coordinate data and plotting axes; no external data sources or input streams.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; no data exfiltration, network activity, or file operations detected.",
  "flows": "Input coordinate data flows into plotting functions which render visualizations on provided axes.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names; suspicious import of a non-standard module from 'mpl_toolkits.mplot3d'; calls to non-existent numpy functions (e.g., np.hOlgbllkTDGYXAHdvlvYQCMNAQMOgTXl).",
  "analysis": "The code provides spatial plotting utilities with standard logic but is heavily obfuscated, likely to conceal intent or for proprietary reasons. The suspicious import and invalid numpy function calls suggest placeholder or intentionally obscured code. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or system modification is present. The obfuscation is consistent across multiple reports, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign visualization utility functions with significant obfuscation. No active malware or malicious behavior is evident. The high obfuscation scores reflect the difficulty in understanding the code, but the security risk remains low. Further static or dynamic analysis could clarify intent, but based on current evidence, the code is not malicious.",
