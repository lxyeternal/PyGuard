  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign visualization utility functions with significant obfuscation. No active malware or malicious behavior is evident. The high obfuscation scores reflect the difficulty in understanding the code, but the security risk remains low. Further static or dynamic analysis could clarify intent, but based on current evidence, the code is not malicious."
