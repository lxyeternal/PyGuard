  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'scikit-spatial' package using importlib metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string values to variables, import statements for importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, and retrieval of package version.",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data processing or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Variables are assigned static strings, and version retrieval is a read-only operation from package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Variables are assigned hardcoded strings that appear to be personal information but are not used elsewhere in the code. The code only performs a package version query without further processing.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two variables with hardcoded personal data but does not utilize them further. It conditionally imports importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata based on availability, then retrieves the version of the 'scikit-spatial' package. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The variables may suggest an intent to store personal info, but without further context, they are inert in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward package version retrieval with no malicious actions or security risks detected. The hardcoded personal data are unused and do not affect security, indicating low risk and no malware presence.",
