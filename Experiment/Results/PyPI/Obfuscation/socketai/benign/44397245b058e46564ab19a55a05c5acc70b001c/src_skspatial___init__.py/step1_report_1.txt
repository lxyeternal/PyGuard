{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'scikit-spatial' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings storing a name and email address; import statements for importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data flows leading to data leaks or execution paths affecting system security.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only reads package metadata and stores personal info in variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded personal information (name and email) which might be considered unnecessary or suspicious if intended for malicious tracking or exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns personal information to variables, which could be used for identification or exfiltration. The import logic is standard for compatibility across Python versions. No suspicious behavior such as network activity, code execution, or data leakage mechanisms is present. The code's sole function is to retrieve package version information.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign and straightforward, primarily aimed at version retrieval with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The inclusion of personal data is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
