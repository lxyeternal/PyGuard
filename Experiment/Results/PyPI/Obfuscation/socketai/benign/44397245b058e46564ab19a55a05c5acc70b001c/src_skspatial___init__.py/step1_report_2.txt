  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'scikit-spatial' package using importlib_metadata.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for name and email, import statements for importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, version retrieval call.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks are observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded personal data (name and email) which may be unnecessary or for identification purposes; no other suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes two variables with personal information, which could be considered sensitive. It conditionally imports 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata' to maintain compatibility across Python versions. It then retrieves the version of the 'scikit-spatial' package. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious activity, code injection, or suspicious data handling. The hardcoded personal data could be unnecessary for functionality and might represent a privacy concern but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply retrieves package version information and contains hardcoded personal data. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The only concern is potential unnecessary exposure of personal data, which does not constitute malicious activity.",
