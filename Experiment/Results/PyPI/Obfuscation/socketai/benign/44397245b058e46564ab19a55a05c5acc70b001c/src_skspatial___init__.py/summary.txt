  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple package version retrieval. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of hardcoded personal data, which raises privacy considerations but does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is minimal (0.2), and security risk is very low (0.1). The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary."
