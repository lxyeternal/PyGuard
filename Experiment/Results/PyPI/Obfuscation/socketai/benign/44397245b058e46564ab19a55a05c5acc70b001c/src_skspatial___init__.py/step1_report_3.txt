{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'scikit-spatial' package installed in the environment.",
  "sources": "The code reads package metadata using importlib_metadata or importlib.metadata to get the version information.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code only reads package version information.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flow from input to sensitive operations; version retrieval is benign.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of two variables with base64-encoded-looking strings assigned to seemingly arbitrary names; no decoding or usage is shown. These variables are not used elsewhere, indicating potential placeholders or obfuscation attempt but no actual malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code first attempts to import importlib.metadata; if unavailable, falls back to importlib_metadata. It then retrieves the version of the 'scikit-spatial' package. The two variables with seemingly random strings are assigned but not used or processed, which could be an obfuscation tactic or residual code. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The core functionality is benign and typical for package metadata access. The unused variables are suspicious but do not execute or leak data.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main purpose is to obtain package version info, which is benign. The presence of unused, obfuscated-looking variables raises minor suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent or malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears safe.",
