  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'scikit-spatial' package using importlib metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package version with importlib_metadata or importlib.metadata",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or untrusted data handling points; no data leak or effect.",
  "flows": "Importing package version information from the package metadata to the variable __version__",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials stored in variables that appear to be personal information (name and email).",
  "analysis": "The code defines two variables containing personal information: a name and an email address. It then conditionally imports importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata to obtain the version number of the 'scikit-spatial' package, assigning this to __version__. The use of importlib to get package metadata is standard and safe. The hardcoded personal data in variables may indicate privacy concerns but is not inherently malicious. No code injections, network calls, or suspicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a straightforward package version retrieval and stores personal data in variables. While the hardcoded personal information could raise privacy issues, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Overall, the code appears benign.",
