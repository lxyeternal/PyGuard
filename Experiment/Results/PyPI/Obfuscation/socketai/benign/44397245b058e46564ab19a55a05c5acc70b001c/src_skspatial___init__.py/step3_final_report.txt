  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'scikit-spatial' package and assign personal information to variables.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded personal info variables, import statements, version retrieval call",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "Assignment of personal info variables -> import of package metadata -> retrieval of package version",
  "anomalies": "Presence of unused variables containing personal data and obfuscated-looking variable names",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign operation: importing metadata and retrieving package version. The personal info variables are assigned but unused, which could be a privacy concern but does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscated variable names and unused strings suggest minor obfuscation or placeholders but do not constitute malicious obfuscation. The overall behavior is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple package version retrieval. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of hardcoded personal data, which raises privacy considerations but does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is minimal (0.2), and security risk is very low (0.1). The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
