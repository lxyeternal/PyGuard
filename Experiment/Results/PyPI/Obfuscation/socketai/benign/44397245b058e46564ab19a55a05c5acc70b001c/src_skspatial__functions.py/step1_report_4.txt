{
  "purpose": "The code provides mathematical utility functions, including close value comparison, vector operations, and solving quadratic equations.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are the 'obj' parameter in functions like YKIJUdiSCYzNkyPKKUJJaxqlhSbybWAW and KPABphBCbMZQVhpFHhPIIXIGqyhLpkDu, and function arguments such as points, vectors, and coefficients.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks that process untrusted input leading to security vulnerabilities; the functions perform calculations without side effects like network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into mathematical functions where calculations are performed; no data flows into external systems or sensitive areas, only mathematical processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a randomly named function (WMAzksJHgkQekpNdvGktIrUMOWURrKKv) with dynamic rounding and error checks appears normal; no suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The use of np.vectorize on math.isclose is benign.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for mathematical operations: comparing close values, applying functions along axes, stacking arrays, wrapping functions to enforce float64 output, and solving quadratic equations. No network, file, or environment variable interactions are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious dynamic code is detected. The variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, but their purposes are standard mathematical utilities. No malicious patterns such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system disruption are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of mathematical utility functions with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The obfuscation seems limited to variable and function names, which do not imply malicious purpose. Overall, it is a benign library of mathematical helpers.",
