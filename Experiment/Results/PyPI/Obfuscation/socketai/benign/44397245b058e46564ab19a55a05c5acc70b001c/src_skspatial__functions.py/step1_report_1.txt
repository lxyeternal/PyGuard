  "purpose": "The code provides mathematical and spatial analysis functions, including coordinate comparisons, vector operations, and quadratic solution calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters such as 'obj', 'point', 'WnjPhJaSQrjuOCuqSFDjbJRDJFMukxNz', and various numeric inputs for calculations.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include use of 'math.sqrt', 'np.apply_along_axis', 'np.vstack', and 'np.vectorize'. No network, file, or sensitive data handling is evident.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into functions from parameters, with some computations involving mathematical functions, array operations, and vectorized comparisons. There are no external untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "The use of obfuscated variable names and the creation of a vectorized 'math.isclose' function via 'np.vectorize' are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily implements mathematical utility functions: a comparison with 'math.isclose', a sum of squared evaluations, array stacking, a decorator to enforce float64 return type, a quadratic solution calculator, and a vectorized 'isclose'. All operations are standard mathematical procedures. No network access, data exfiltration, or system manipulation code is present. Obfuscated variable names may suggest code complexity, but they do not imply malicious behavior. The functions are self-contained, performing calculations without external side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of mathematical utility functions with no indications of malicious behavior or sabotage. No suspicious network, file, or environment interactions are evident. The obfuscated variable names are likely for code complexity or generic placeholder purposes, not malicious intent.",
