  "purpose": "Performs a geometric projection of a point onto a basis by subtracting an origin point and multiplying with the basis transpose.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: WnjPhJaSQrjuOCuqSFDjbJRDJFMukxNz, point_origin, vectors_basis",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points detected",
  "flows": "Subtracts point_origin from WnjPhJaSQrjuOCuqSFDjbJRDJFMukxNz, then multiplies the result with the transpose of vectors_basis",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and a non-standard, obscure type hint 'jmczWCtvnFoUaemZqmnnqyLAnRjfFEsb'",
  "analysis": "The code executes a standard spatial projection: vector subtraction followed by matrix multiplication. The operations are mathematically sound and typical for geometric calculations. Obfuscation through variable names and type hints suggests concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. No network, data leakage, or malicious behavior is present. The function relies on numpy for core operations, and the obfuscation does not impact functionality but hampers readability. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: 0.1, obfuscated: ~0.75) are consistent with the benign nature of the code, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate geometric projection with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, risk is low, and obfuscation is acknowledged. No adjustments are necessary.",
