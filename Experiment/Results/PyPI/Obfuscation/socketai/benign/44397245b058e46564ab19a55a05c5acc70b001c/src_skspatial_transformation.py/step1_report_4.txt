{
  "purpose": "The function calculates the projection of a point onto a basis set of vectors, likely for spatial or geometric computations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'WnjPhJaSQrjuOCuqSFDjbJRDJFMukxNz' (point), 'point_origin' (reference point), 'vectors_basis' (basis vectors).",
  "sinks": "Uses numpy's subtract, matmul, transpose functions for computation, with no apparent data leaks or external data output.",
  "flows": "Subtracts 'point_origin' from 'WnjPhJaSQrjuOCuqSFDjbJRDJFMukxNz', then multiplies the result by the transpose of 'vectors_basis' to compute projections.",
  "anomalies": "The variable and function names are obfuscated, which makes understanding the intent difficult, but no signs of malicious behavior or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a vector subtraction followed by a matrix multiplication, typical for projection calculations. All operations are within numpy, with no indication of malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but the operations themselves are standard mathematical procedures. There are no hardcoded secrets, external network calls, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a standard geometric projection function with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation could be for code concealment but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
