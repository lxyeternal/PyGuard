  "purpose": "Calculate the projection of a point onto a basis defined by vectors using numpy operations.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: WnjPhJaSQrjuOCuqSFDjbJRDJFMukxNz (point), point_origin, and vectors_basis.",
  "sinks": "Return value is an ndarray containing the projection results; no direct data sinks or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through subtraction and matrix multiplication, producing the projection ndarray.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or dynamic code execution. The code appears intentionally obfuscated but functions as a straightforward geometric calculation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, performs subtraction to find a vector difference, then calculates a dot product with a basis matrix. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but the operations themselves are common linear algebra procedures for projecting a point onto a basis. No external network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior are present. No code injection or obfuscation beyond variable naming is observed. The functions serve a geometric purpose without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a geometric projection calculation with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate but is intentionally obfuscated, which may hinder readability but does not imply malicious intent.",
