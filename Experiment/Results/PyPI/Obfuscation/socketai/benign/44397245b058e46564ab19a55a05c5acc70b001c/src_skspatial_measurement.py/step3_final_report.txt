{
  "purpose": "The code provides geometric utility functions for calculating areas of triangles, tetrahedra, and polygons using vector operations.",
  "sources": "Function parameters representing points; no external data sources or input streams.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; calculations are internal and do not involve network, file I/O, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Points are input as source data; vector operations process these points to compute geometric measures; no external data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation evidenced by nonsensical function names (e.g., 'np.olgbllkTDGYXAHdvlvYQCMNAQMOgTXl') which do not exist in numpy; obscure variable and type names; possible typos suggest obfuscation or sabotage.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geometric calculations using vector cross and dot products. The presence of non-existent functions like 'np.olgbllkTDGYXAHdvlvYQCMNAQMOgTXl' indicates obfuscation. The custom type 'jmczWCtvnFoUaemZqmnnqyLAnRjfFEsb' is opaque and warrants further inspection. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal functionality, which raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The code's purpose seems legitimate, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily geometric utility functions with heavy obfuscation. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and suspicious function names suggest potential concealment of malicious payloads. Further deobfuscation and static analysis are recommended before deployment.",
