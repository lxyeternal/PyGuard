  "purpose": "This code configures the settings for building Sphinx documentation, including theme, extensions, project info, and gallery configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports (os, sys, sphinx_bootstrap_theme, sphinx_gallery.sorting, skspatial); hardcoded string assignments; sys.path modification; static configuration data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources; no output to external systems or network; no user input handling; no file writing beyond static configuration.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration is used solely for documentation build purposes.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, but this appears to be an artifact of code obfuscation or minification rather than malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code structures are present. The code is predominantly static configuration for Sphinx documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a Sphinx documentation environment, importing necessary modules and defining configuration dictionaries and lists for themes, extensions, project info, gallery settings, and navigation. It does not read external input, perform any network activity, execute dynamic code, or access sensitive data. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not indicate malicious behavior. No suspicious logic, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code appears to be legitimate documentation configuration with obfuscated variable names, which could be due to minification or obfuscation but does not inherently suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a static configuration script for Sphinx documentation with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate setup code with no external data handling or harmful actions.",
