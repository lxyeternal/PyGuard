{
  "purpose": "Define a type alias for Union[np.ndarray, Sequence] using an obfuscated variable name, likely for type hinting purposes.",
  "sources": "No data input, output, or external data sources; only module imports and variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external effects present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only establishes a type alias without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable name 'jmczWCtvnFoUaemZqmnnqyLAnRjfFEsb', which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a type alias with an obfuscated name. No functions, data processing, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The obfuscation could be an attempt to conceal intent but, in isolation, does not indicate malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated≈0.7-0.8, risk=0) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The high obfuscation score is justified by the variable name, but overall, the code is harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward type alias definition with obfuscated naming. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and lack of malicious intent.",
