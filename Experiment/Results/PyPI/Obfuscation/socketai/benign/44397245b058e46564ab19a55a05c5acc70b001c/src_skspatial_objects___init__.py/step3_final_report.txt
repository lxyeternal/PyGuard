  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, data inputs, dynamic code execution points, hardcoded URLs/IPs, obfuscated variable names.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, data exfiltration points, dynamic code execution functions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or inputs flow into dynamic execution or network transmission functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious control flow, hardcoded URLs/IPs, inconsistent code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are often used to conceal malicious intent. No explicit malicious payloads or harmful actions are confirmed. The suspicious techniques raise moderate concern, warranting a malware score around 0.4. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7) due to variable naming and code structure. The security risk is moderate (~0.4), reflecting potential concealment without confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques that could be used maliciously, but no definitive malicious payloads are present. Slightly increasing the malware suspicion score from 0.2 to 0.4 would better reflect the observed techniques. Overall, the code warrants cautious monitoring but does not confirm malicious activity at this stage.",
