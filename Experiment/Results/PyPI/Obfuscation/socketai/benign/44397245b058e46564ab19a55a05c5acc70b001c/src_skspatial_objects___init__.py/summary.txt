  "conclusion": "The code shows obfuscation and dynamic execution techniques that could be used maliciously, but no definitive malicious payloads are present. Slightly increasing the malware suspicion score from 0.2 to 0.4 would better reflect the observed techniques. Overall, the code warrants cautious monitoring but does not confirm malicious activity at this stage."
