  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Objective-C plugin or extension initialization script with significant obfuscation. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or payloads. The scores should reflect a very low malware risk, high obfuscation, and moderate overall security risk due to the obfuscation and potential for misuse, but without active malicious indicators."
