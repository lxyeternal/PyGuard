      "conclusion": "The dependency appears to be infrastructure scaffolding with obfuscated naming, likely auto-generated. There is no current evidence of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the overall security risk remains low. Continuous monitoring is recommended if these placeholder functions are later implemented with active logic."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard AWS CDK module setup for CloudWatch logs archiving, with no direct malicious activity. The primary concern is the trustworthiness of the external package and the obfuscation of variable names, which warrants verification of package integrity. Overall, the malware risk is very low, obfuscation is moderate, and supply chain security practices should be followed."
