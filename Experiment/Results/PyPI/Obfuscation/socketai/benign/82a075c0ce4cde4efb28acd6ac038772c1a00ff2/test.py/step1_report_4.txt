  "anomalies": "The code contains only comments with no actual logic, no obfuscated code, or hidden instructions.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is essentially empty aside from a UTF-8 encoding declaration and comments. There are no functions, data handling, or executable statements. This suggests it is either an incomplete snippet or a non-functional placeholder. Since no data input, output, or logic exists, there are no security concerns, malicious behavior, or anomalies to detect.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscated code. It appears to be a placeholder or minimal file with no operational content.",
