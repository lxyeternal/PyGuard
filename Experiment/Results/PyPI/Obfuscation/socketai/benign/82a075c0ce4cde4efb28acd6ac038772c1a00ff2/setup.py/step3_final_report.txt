  "purpose": "This code provides a Python wrapper class for the Microsoft Translator API, demonstrating usage with an API key and translation method.",
  "sources": "API key input parameter, potential network requests during translation (not shown in code snippet).",
  "sinks": "Network requests to Microsoft services, potential data leakage if API key is mishandled outside this code.",
  "flows": "API key passed during class instantiation, translation request sent over network, response received.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious code, class name appears obfuscated but no malicious intent detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API wrapper with usage examples, no malicious or obfuscated code present. No network activity or suspicious behavior is shown. The obfuscation score is slightly elevated due to class name appearance but not indicative of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The security risk is minimal, mainly related to API key handling outside this code. Malware score remains zero as no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign API wrapper with no malicious intent or activity. The scores are appropriate, with a slight overestimation of obfuscation in class naming but no actual obfuscation or malicious behavior. Overall, it presents a low security risk.",
