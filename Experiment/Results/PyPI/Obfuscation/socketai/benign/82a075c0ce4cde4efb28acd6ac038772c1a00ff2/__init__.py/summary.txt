  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated API client for Microsoft Translator, with no evidence of malicious intent. Obfuscation is high but justified by proprietary reasons. The security risk is low, and malware presence is unlikely. Scores are consistent with the code's structure and behavior."
