  "purpose": "A Python client wrapper for the Microsoft Translator API, including custom exceptions and configuration setup.",
  "sources": "Class constructor parameters, import statements, warning messages, and class variables",
  "sinks": "API endpoint URL, potential network requests (not shown), exception handling",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters to API endpoint interactions, exception messages to logs",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, verbose comments, warnings about deprecated 'app_id' parameter",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exceptions and an API client class with obfuscated class names, likely for proprietary reasons. No network requests, credential leaks, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation is high but consistent across reports and may be for proprietary protection rather than malicious intent. Warnings about deprecated parameters suggest ongoing maintenance. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code is present. The code appears to be a legitimate API wrapper with obfuscation, which warrants cautious monitoring but does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated API client for Microsoft Translator, with no evidence of malicious intent. Obfuscation is high but justified by proprietary reasons. The security risk is low, and malware presence is unlikely. Scores are consistent with the code's structure and behavior.",
