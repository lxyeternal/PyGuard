  "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, complex media processing Telegram bot with no evidence of malware or sabotage. The main security concern involves potential resource exhaustion or command injection through subprocess calls and URL handling. Scores are consistent with the analysis: low malware risk (~0.2), no obfuscation (0), moderate risk (~0.4). Proper input validation, sandboxing, and resource limits are recommended to mitigate exploitation risks. The code does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors."
