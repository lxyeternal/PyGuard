      "conclusion": "The setup script appears legitimate with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious code or activity in this snippet. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but based solely on this code, it is not malicious. Monitoring of the actual implementation code (`scdlbot.scdlbot:main`) is recommended for comprehensive security assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a configuration script with heavy obfuscation and an unusual 'sys' attribute modification. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The suspicious attribute insertion warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the security risk score is low (~0.2)."

      "conclusion": "The source code is a legitimate, complex media processing Telegram bot with no evidence of malware or sabotage. The main security concern involves potential resource exhaustion or command injection through subprocess calls and URL handling. Scores are consistent with the analysis: low malware risk (~0.2), no obfuscation (0), moderate risk (~0.4). Proper input validation, sandboxing, and resource limits are recommended to mitigate exploitation risks. The code does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors."
