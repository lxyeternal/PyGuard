{
  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation, loading project info from 'pyproject.toml' and setting various parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading 'pyproject.toml' file, accessing 'tool.poetry' data, and the insertion into 'sys.SZWvanKXAvnoJWwwGzMdPMJXrQcVhXLa'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks indicating data leaks or malicious effects; the code modifies 'sys' attributes and sets configuration variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from 'pyproject.toml' into variables; the insertion into 'sys' attribute is a suspicious flow that could be exploited if malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Insertion into 'sys.SZWvanKXAvnoJWwwGzMdPMJXrQcVhXLa', which is not a standard attribute of 'sys'; heavily obfuscated variable names; redundant assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code loads project metadata from 'pyproject.toml' using 'tomli', assigns configuration variables for Sphinx, and performs an unusual insertion into a non-standard 'sys' attribute. No network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration is evident. The heavy obfuscation and suspicious attribute insertion raise concerns but do not demonstrate malicious behavior. The code appears to be benign configuration with obfuscation possibly used to hide internal variables or for other benign reasons.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a configuration script with heavy obfuscation and an unusual 'sys' attribute modification. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The suspicious attribute insertion warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the security risk score is low (~0.2).",
