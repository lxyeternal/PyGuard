  "conclusion": "This is a legitimate build automation script for libsodium with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The moderate security risk stems from external download reliance and execution of system commands without verification. The obfuscation is superficial and typical for such scripts. Proper checksum validation of downloads is recommended to mitigate supply chain risks."
