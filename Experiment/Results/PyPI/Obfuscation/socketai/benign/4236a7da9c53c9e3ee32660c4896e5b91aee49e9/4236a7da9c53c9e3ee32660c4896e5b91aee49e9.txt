      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a cryptographic utility module employing obfuscation techniques that could be for security or concealment purposes. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation but low in terms of malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "This is a legitimate build automation script for libsodium with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The moderate security risk stems from external download reliance and execution of system commands without verification. The obfuscation is superficial and typical for such scripts. Proper checksum validation of downloads is recommended to mitigate supply chain risks."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated cryptographic import statements with no active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains at 0. Further review of the larger codebase and usage of these imports is recommended to rule out hidden malicious intent."
