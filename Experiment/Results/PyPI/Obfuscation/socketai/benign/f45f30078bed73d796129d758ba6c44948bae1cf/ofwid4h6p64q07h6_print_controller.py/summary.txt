  "conclusion": "The security reports are consistent and justified. The only recommended adjustment is to raise Report 3's malware score to 0.3 to better reflect the potential risk posed by obfuscation and dynamic functions. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate security risks, with high suspicion only in Report 4. No further significant modifications are necessary."
