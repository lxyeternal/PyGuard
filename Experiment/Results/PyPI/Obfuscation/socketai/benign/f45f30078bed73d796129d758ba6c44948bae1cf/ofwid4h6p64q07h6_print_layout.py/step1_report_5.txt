{
  "purpose": "The code generates a formatted text layout for client billing or invoice details based on provided data.",
  "sources": "Data input via the 'data' dictionary parameter, including multiple fields such as 'dt', 'hour', 'razao', 'endereco', 'tel', 'txt1', 'clienteid', 'clientedsc', 'tipopg', 'qtdparc', 'vencimento', 'produto', 'subtotal', 'desconto', 'totalgeral', 'valorpago', 'troco', 'userid', 'userdsc', 'txt2', 'txt3', and 'devolucao'.",
  "sinks": "String concatenations for the '_layout' attribute; no external system calls, database operations, or network interactions are present that could be exploited.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the input dictionary into string formatting operations, constructing a multi-line text layout; no untrusted or malicious data manipulation paths are evident beyond normal string interpolation.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic string formatting with data fields directly from the input; however, there are no signs of obfuscated code, code injection, or malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code segments are detected.",
  "analysis": "The function constructs a formatted invoice or billing layout by inserting data from the input dictionary into a predefined string template. The data is accessed via dictionary keys and formatted with slicing and string methods to control presentation. There are no external system calls, network communications, or code execution features. The code is purely presentational and does not perform any insecure operations such as executing user-provided code, reading environment variables insecurely, or accessing sensitive system resources. No signs of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware are detected. The code’s structure is straightforward, and the data flow is limited to string concatenation, which does not pose a security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a template generator for invoice-like documents, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. It processes input data to produce formatted output without executing or manipulating data in a harmful way. Therefore, it is deemed safe and free from malware or security threats.",
