  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, used to define package metadata and install configuration.",
  "sources": "The package name and version are hardcoded in the setup() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no data flow from sources to sinks in this minimal script.",
  "anomalies": "The package name appears to be a random string, which could be suspicious, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup and find_packages from setuptools, then calls setup() with fixed name and version. There are no dynamic inputs, environment variables, or external data sources. The package name 'ofwid4h6p64q07h6' appears to be an obfuscated or random string, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but in this context, it is just a name. The script is a standard minimal setup.py with no suspicious logic, code injection, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. The unusual package name might raise suspicion, but it does not constitute malicious intent by itself.",
