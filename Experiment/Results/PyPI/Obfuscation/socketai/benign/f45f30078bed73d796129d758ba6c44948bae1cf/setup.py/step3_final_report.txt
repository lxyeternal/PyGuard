{
  "purpose": "Minimal setup script configuring a Python package with a potentially obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "The code reads fixed string literals for package name and version; no external or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; no data leaks or malicious effects present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The package name 'ofwid4h6p64q07h6' appears as a random or obfuscated string, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script importing from setuptools and calling setup() with fixed parameters. No dynamic code, user input, or external data is involved. The only notable anomaly is the package name, which appears obfuscated. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious functions or behaviors. Malware scores are consistently zero, reflecting the absence of malicious intent. Obfuscation scores vary based on the suspicion level of the package name, but given the simplicity of the code, these are justifiable. Security risk scores are low, as the code performs no harmful actions. Confidence in the benign nature of the code is high, with scores around 0.9, and the suspicion is primarily due to the naming pattern rather than code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with an obfuscated package name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The suspicion is solely based on the package name's randomness, which does not constitute malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0. The obfuscation score could be slightly increased to reflect the suspicious name, but overall, the package is safe.",
