  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements, no data flow or processing shown",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'uhlofYpKQifJbCvEPJNEGaeXgtOzmErX' appears as a nonsensical identifier, suggesting obfuscation or a potential attempt to hide malicious code, or it could be a randomly named variable",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are standard. However, the module 'uhlofYpKQifJbCvEPJNEGaeXgtOzmErX' has an unusual, random-looking name that does not follow typical naming conventions. No other logic or data processing is present. The other imports are from local package modules, which is normal. The presence of a suspiciously named import may indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious code, but with only import statements, it is difficult to determine malicious intent definitively. There are no clear indicators of malicious behavior, but the nonsensical module name warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard import statements, with one module name that seems suspiciously obfuscated or randomly named. No direct malicious activity is observable, but the unusual module name could be a sign of obfuscation or hidden intent. Additional context or code is needed for a definitive assessment.",
