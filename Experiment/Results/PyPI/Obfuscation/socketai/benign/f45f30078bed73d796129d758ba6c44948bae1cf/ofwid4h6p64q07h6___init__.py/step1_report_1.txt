  "purpose": "Importing various controllers and modules for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Module import statements from relative package paths and a uniquely named attribute in response module.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data handling or sink operations observed.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual attribute name 'uhlofYpKQifJbCvEPJNEGaeXgtOzmErX' in response module; could be an obfuscated or randomly generated name, which warrants suspicion. No credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements from relative modules, which is typical in Python projects for modular design. The response module's attribute name appears random and potentially obfuscated, possibly intended to hide or obfuscate its purpose. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is present. The unusual attribute name is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior but the random attribute name should be reviewed in the larger context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard import statements with one anomalous, seemingly obfuscated attribute name. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risks based on this snippet alone, but the suspicious attribute name warrants further review within the full project context.",
