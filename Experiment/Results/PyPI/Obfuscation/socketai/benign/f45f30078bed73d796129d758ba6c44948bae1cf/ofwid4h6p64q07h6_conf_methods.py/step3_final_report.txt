  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, local files, network calls, dynamic code execution (eval, subprocess), hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, environment variables, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input flow into sinks like network transmission, file system, or system commands, possibly via dynamic execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import statements, dynamic code execution (eval, exec), hardcoded strings, suspicious module usage, obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "Most reports describe benign code with straightforward data processing, no eval/exec, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation. Report 4 indicates obfuscation and dynamic code execution, raising suspicion. The scores assigned in reports align with these observations: benign reports have malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2; Report 4 shows high suspicion with malware=0.7, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.75. The reasoning is consistent; the high scores in Report 4 are justified if such features are present. Overall, the evidence supports low to moderate risk, with Report 4 as the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of code appears benign, with one report indicating significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting caution. The scoring reflects these findings accurately. No active malware is confirmed, but the suspicious patterns in Report 4 justify higher suspicion. Overall, the dependency is low risk with a need for further review of obfuscated parts if present.",
