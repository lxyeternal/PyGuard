  "conclusion": "The majority of code appears benign, with one report indicating significant obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting caution. The scoring reflects these findings accurately. No active malware is confirmed, but the suspicious patterns in Report 4 justify higher suspicion. Overall, the dependency is low risk with a need for further review of obfuscated parts if present."
