  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or functionality typical for a Python package, but the specific purpose is unclear without detailed analysis.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, file reads, or network requests (if present). However, no explicit sources are identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks are system calls, network communications, or data writes. No clear sink functions or commands are evident from the snippet.",
  "flows": "Without specific code details, no explicit source-to-sink data flows are identifiable. Further code details are necessary to determine flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are detected in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code has a standard structure without suspicious patterns. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal, and no malicious side effects are evident. The snippet does not include network activity, credential theft, or other malicious indicators. The absence of explicit data sources or sinks limits definitive conclusions, but based on the available content, it seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears legitimate, with no anomalies or malicious indicators detected.",
