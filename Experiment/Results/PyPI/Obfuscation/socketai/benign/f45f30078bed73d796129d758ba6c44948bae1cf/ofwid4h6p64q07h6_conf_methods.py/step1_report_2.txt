{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of comments or documentation. It appears to be a Python script that may perform some form of data processing or network communication, but this cannot be definitively determined from the provided code.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, potentially from user input, configuration files, or external sources. Specific source points include environment variable accesses and any data read from files or network if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing, executing system commands, or logging. These are points where untrusted data could cause data leakage or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs towards sinks like network or file operations. The code may process data through intermediate steps, but explicit flow details require code inspection.",
  "anomalies": "No overt anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are detected. The code structure appears standard, with no unusual language features or dynamic execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly, including its imports, variable usage, control flow, and function calls. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or cryptomining were observed. Use of third-party libraries seems legitimate, and no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code snippets are present. The overall structure suggests a standard application with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical Python script, with no indicators of malware or malicious data handling. The overall security risk score is low.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
