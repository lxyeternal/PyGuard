  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion of malicious intent, particularly in reports with high obfuscation and suspicious patterns. Slightly increasing malware scores for reports with hardcoded secrets and obfuscation is justified. Overall, the code warrants caution, with a moderate to high threat level based on the evidence."
