      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate build configuration script with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate, with low malware and risk scores, but further review of the broader package is recommended to ensure no malicious code is hidden."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports correctly identified the benign nature, and the scores are justified. Minor security risk scores of 0.1 are acceptable but could be adjusted to 0 for consistency. Overall, the code poses no security concern."
