  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the described issues, and the context.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code is a custom exception handler for Django REST Framework, intended to normalize and format error responses.\n- The code contains several anomalies:\n  - An import statement with a nonsensical alias: `from rest_framework.views import fwpeoraJfhISYsgBfrhjVxPmmfJHObiH as default_exception_handler`. This alias is never used.\n  - The function and variable names are heavily obfuscated (e.g., `fwpeoraJfhISYsgBfrhjVxPmmfJHObiH`, `yqvNvYkKRenNGbRCgtlxfeXinuuPyZXV`).\n  - Merging of settings with default configurations adds complexity and could hide malicious configurations if present.\n- No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration is present in the code snippet.\n- The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent, but it does raise suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Issue-by-issue review:\n\n#### 1. Malware and Obfuscation\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports.\n- **Obfuscated code:** High (scores between 0.2 and 0.8). The import alias and variable names are intentionally obscure.\n- **Justification:** Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious activity but can be used to hide malicious code. No malicious behavior is detected in the code snippet.\n\n#### 2. Security Risks\n\n- **Scores:** Generally low (0.1 to 0.3).\n- **Potential concerns:** The code exposes exception details when `PRETTY_STANDARD_PYTHON_EXCEPTIONS` is enabled, which could leak internal error info. However, this is controlled via configuration.\n- **Assessment:** No direct security vulnerabilities or backdoors are present.\n\n#### 3. Logical and Reasoning Flaws\n\n- The import alias is unused, suggesting either incomplete code or obfuscation.\n- The merging of settings with defaults could mask malicious configurations if they were injected.\n- The exception normalization is standard practice, though the obfuscation makes it harder to verify correctness.\n\n#### 4. Scores consistency\n\n- The scores assigned are generally consistent with the analysis: high obfuscation, no malware, low security risk.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting benign functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain at 0.0. No malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Given the high obfuscation, I would rate it around **0.8**.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher than 0.2-0.3 due to obfuscation, but the core logic is benign. I would set it around **0.2-0.3**.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of my assessment:\n\n| Score Type        | Suggested Value | Justification                                                                                   |\n|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0.0               | No malicious activity detected.                                                                |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.8               | Heavy obfuscation, nonsensical alias, obscure variable names.                                |\n| Security Risk     | 0.2               | Slight concern due to potential info leakage via detailed error responses, but overall low. |\n\n**Final note:** The code's obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. It warrants caution, but based solely on this snippet, no malware or active threats are present.",
