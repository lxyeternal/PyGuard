  "purpose": "Custom exception handler for Django REST Framework to standardize API error responses.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from exceptions passed to the handler, which could originate from various parts of the application or request handling.",
  "sinks": "Returns Response objects with error details; potentially exposes exception information.",
  "flows": "Exception instances (Http404, PermissionDenied, APIException) are converted into standardized Response objects with appropriate status codes and error details.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; dynamically merging settings; no hardcoded credentials or secrets. No suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception handler for Django REST Framework, translating different exception types into uniform API responses. It handles specific exceptions like Http404 and PermissionDenied by converting them into DRF exceptions, then formats the response based on exception details. It also considers global settings for pretty exception formatting. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. Variable names are deliberately obfuscated, which could be suspicious but appears to serve obfuscation rather than malicious intent. There are no unsafe data handling practices or code injection points. The logic is consistent with standard exception handling, with no hidden or malicious functions identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a custom exception handler for a Django REST Framework project, designed to format error responses consistently. It contains obfuscated variable names but does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be for code concealment rather than malicious intent. Overall, it is a benign utility with no malware indicators.",
