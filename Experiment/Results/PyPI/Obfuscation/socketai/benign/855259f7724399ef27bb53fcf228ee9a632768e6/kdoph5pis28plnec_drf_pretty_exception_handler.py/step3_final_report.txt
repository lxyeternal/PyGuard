{
  "purpose": "A custom exception handler for Django REST Framework that formats exceptions into standardized API responses, handling specific exception types and incorporating configurable error detail verbosity.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from Django settings, accesses exception details, and processes exception objects such as Http404, PermissionDenied, and APIException.",
  "sinks": "Generates HTTP responses with error information; no external data sinks or network activity detected.",
  "flows": "Exception objects are normalized; exception details are extracted and formatted into response payloads; configuration flags influence error detail verbosity.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through nonsensical import alias 'fwpeoraJfhISYsgBfrhjVxPmmfJHObiH' which is unused; variable names are intentionally obscure; merging of settings with defaults adds complexity.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard exception handler, converting various exceptions into API responses with optional detailed error info. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent, with no evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. The import alias is unused, suggesting obfuscation or code concealment. The logic is consistent with benign error handling, and no vulnerabilities are apparent. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware presence is unlikely given the benign functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a heavily obfuscated but benign custom exception handler for Django REST Framework. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, though the obfuscation warrants cautious review. The scores are consistent with its functionality: malware score 0, obfuscation score approximately 0.8, and low security risk (~0.2).",
