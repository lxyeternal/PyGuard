{
  "purpose": "Custom exception handling for Django REST Framework, formatting exception responses with optional 'pretty' settings.",
  "sources": "Reads from exception instances, Django settings, and attributes of exceptions.",
  "sinks": "Response returns and potential data leaks via exception details and error information.",
  "flows": "Input exception objects are processed, potentially modified, and then returned as API responses.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import statement with nonsensical alias 'fwpeoraJfhISYsgBfrhjVxPmmfJHObiH'; variable names are obfuscated and inconsistent; no evident malicious code but excessive obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily redefines exception handling logic, converting various exception types into formatted HTTP responses. It uses dynamic attribute access to incorporate settings and exception details. The obfuscated import alias suggests code concealment, although no malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. The code's structure appears focused on error formatting and response management. The lack of external network calls or system modifications indicates no malicious intent; however, obfuscation may hint at concealment or attempt to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements exception formatting and response generation for a Django API, with notable obfuscation that could be suspicious. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or malware, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
