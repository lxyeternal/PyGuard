  "purpose": "Custom exception handling and error response formatting for a Django REST Framework application.",
  "sources": "Reading exception instances, settings, and input parameters to the handler function.",
  "sinks": "Returning Response objects with error details, potentially exposing internal exception details.",
  "flows": "Exception instances are converted into HTTP responses, with error details formatted into response payloads.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated import alias, dynamic exception type handling, and conditional inclusion of headers and error details.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception handler that intercepts exceptions, normalizes certain Django exceptions to DRF exceptions, and formats the error response. It reads configuration options from settings and constructs response data accordingly. The function modifies exception details based on their type, potentially exposing detailed error info when 'PRETTY_STANDARD_PYTHON_EXCEPTIONS' is enabled. No hardcoded secrets, network communication, file operations, or suspicious behaviors are present. The obfuscated import alias ('fwpeoraJfhISYsgBfrhjVxPmmfJHObiH') is unusual but not malicious by itself. Overall, the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to exception formatting without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a custom error handler for Django REST Framework that formats error responses. It normalizes certain exceptions, adds headers if available, and conditionally exposes detailed exception info based on configuration. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware. The obfuscation of the import name is suspicious but not malicious per se. The code is primarily concerned with error formatting and handling.",
