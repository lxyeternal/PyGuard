{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up fixtures for pytest testing, possibly related to exception handling in a Django REST Framework context.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it only defines local variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows to untrusted outputs or sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random, nonsensical variable names and strings that do not serve an apparent purpose, indicating potential obfuscation or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a testing framework and a specific exception handler module. It defines a fixture function that assigns a base64-like string to a variable, and another function that also assigns a random string to a variable, both using obfuscated variable names. No input reading, network communication, or data processing occurs. The code appears to be either placeholder, obfuscated, or part of a larger testing setup without malicious intent in its current form.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks in its current form. The obfuscated variable names and strings may suggest code generation or testing scaffolding, not malicious activity.",
