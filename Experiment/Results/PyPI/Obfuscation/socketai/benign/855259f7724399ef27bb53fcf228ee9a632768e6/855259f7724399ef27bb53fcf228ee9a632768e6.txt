      "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and contains personal data, which could be exploited if combined with malicious modules. However, no direct malicious activity is present. The overall security risk is moderate, with a low malware likelihood. Vigilance is advised, especially regarding the imported module. Final scores: malware: 0.2, obfuscated: 0.75, security risk: 0.4."

It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, though the obfuscation warrants cautious review. The scores are consistent with its functionality: malware score 0, obfuscation score approximately 0.8, and low security risk (~0.2)."
