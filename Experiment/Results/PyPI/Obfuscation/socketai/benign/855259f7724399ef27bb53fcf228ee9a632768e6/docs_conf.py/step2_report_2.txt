  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the claims, assessing the scores, and ensuring consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The report states the script sets up metadata/configuration and imports a custom exception handler module. This aligns with the code, which imports `drf_pretty_exception_handler` and defines various configuration variables.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No evidence of untrusted data processing or external system calls. The code is static configuration.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names are noted, but no malicious intent is claimed or evident.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, serving configuration/documentation purposes. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity are observed.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0.2 — slightly elevated, but given the benign nature, perhaps could be lower.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — justified due to obfuscated variable names.  \n  - **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on configuration and metadata setup.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling, no network or system commands.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious indicators.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Same as above; benign configuration code with obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — appropriate.  \n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0.1 — very low, consistent with benign code.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7 — justified due to variable naming.  \n  - **Confidence:** 0.9 — acceptable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues; scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Configuration for documentation, no external untrusted input.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flows from untrusted sources; static assignments.\n\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious activity.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely setup/configuration, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0.2 — slightly higher but still low; acceptable given the obfuscation.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.3 — low, but justified.  \n  - **Confidence:** 0.9 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; configuration/setup.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data or network activity.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Benign configuration code.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0 — no risks identified.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — none observed.  \n  - **Confidence:** 0.9 — suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern; configuration for documentation.\n\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling.\n\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation, no suspicious code.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Clearly benign.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0 — correct.  \n  - **SecurityRisk:** 0 — appropriate.  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.  \n  - **Confidence:** 1 — high confidence.\n\n**Verdict:** Fully justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the analysis. No malicious code detected or implied.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slightly elevated in some reports (0.7–0.8) due to variable names, which is reasonable. The last report correctly assigns 0, as no obfuscation is present there.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. Slight variations are acceptable but could be standardized to 0.1 or 0 for clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are generally consistent with the code analysis. No significant discrepancies or overestimations are evident.\n\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the static, configuration nature of the code.\n\n- The obfuscation scores are appropriate, considering the variable naming style.\n\n- The malware scores correctly reflect the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all reports — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** Slightly elevated in some reports, justified by variable naming; otherwise, 0 where no obfuscation exists.\n\n- **Risk:** Very low, around 0.1 or 0, consistent with benign configuration code.\n\n**Overall, the reports are accurate and reasonable. No changes needed.**",
