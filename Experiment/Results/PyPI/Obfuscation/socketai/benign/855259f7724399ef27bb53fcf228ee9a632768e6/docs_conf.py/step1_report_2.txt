{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up configuration variables and metadata for documentation and project settings related to 'drf_pretty_exception_handler'.",
  "sources": "Import statements (`os`, `sys`, and `drf_pretty_exception_handler`), variable assignments, and dictionary/list initializations.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that execute untrusted data or perform sensitive actions. No code execution, network operations, or data exfiltration points detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static assignments and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear randomly generated or obfuscated, but no malicious code present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily imports standard libraries and a local module, then assigns numerous configuration and metadata variables. Variable names seem obfuscated or auto-generated, which might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but they are only used for configuration and documentation purposes. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, or suspicious network activity. No code execution, input handling, or external calls that could be exploited are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a configuration and metadata setup for documentation purposes. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
