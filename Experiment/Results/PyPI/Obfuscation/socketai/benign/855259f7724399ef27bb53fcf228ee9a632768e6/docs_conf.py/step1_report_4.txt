  "purpose": "This code appears to set up configuration and metadata for a documentation project related to 'drf_pretty_exception_handler', including paths, static files, and project information.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables (if any), and from the imported 'drf_pretty_exception_handler' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that handle untrusted input data; no data leaks or malicious actions are evident.",
  "flows": "The code assigns variables based on imports and static values; no dynamic or untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs detected. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The script mainly defines variables for project setup, including paths, static files, documentation info, and metadata. It imports a local module and uses its attributes, but does not perform any input processing, network communication, or executable actions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard configuration/setup code for documentation purposes. It does not contain any malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
