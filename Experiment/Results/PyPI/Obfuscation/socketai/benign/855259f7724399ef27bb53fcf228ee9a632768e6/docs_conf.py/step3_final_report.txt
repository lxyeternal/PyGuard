  "purpose": "Configuration and metadata setup for documentation related to 'drf_pretty_exception_handler', including importing the module and defining variables.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'drf_pretty_exception_handler' and static variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script setting metadata, importing a module, and defining variables. No dynamic execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is evident. Variable obfuscation is present but does not imply malicious intent. The code's benign nature is consistent across multiple assessments.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration file with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
