{
  "purpose": "The script appears to set up metadata and configuration for documentation and possibly imports a custom exception handler module for a Django Rest Framework project.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'drf_pretty_exception_handler' module, reads environment variables via os and sys modules, and accesses attributes from the imported module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data are present. No network, file, or system commands that process untrusted input are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules and attributes to internal variables; no flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names that do not follow standard naming conventions; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or environment variables detected; no malicious code or unusual behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly imports a custom exception handler, sets up various configuration variables related to documentation (e.g., project info, static paths, templates). The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration routines are present. The code appears to be standard configuration or metadata setup with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration for documentation and module imports without any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names suggest an unusual coding style but do not indicate malicious intent.",
