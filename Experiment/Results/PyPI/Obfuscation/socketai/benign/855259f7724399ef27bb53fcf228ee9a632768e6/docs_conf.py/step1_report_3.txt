{
  "purpose": "This script appears to set up documentation and configuration variables for a project related to 'drf_pretty_exception_handler', possibly for generating documentation or configuring a build process.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, system path, and module attributes. No external untrusted input is explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform insecure actions.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from sources to sinks that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "anomalies": "Variables with obfuscated or non-descriptive names; no clear use of sensitive information like credentials or secrets; the code appears to be configuration/setup code only.",
  "analysis": "The code predominantly initializes variables, imports modules, and sets up configuration data for documentation or project setup. There are no functions, user inputs, or data processing routines. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure code practices are evident. The presence of seemingly random variable names may suggest obfuscation, but they are consistent with a configuration script. No external data sources or network operations are present. The code's intent appears benign and related to project documentation or configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration/setup script with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. It does not perform any actions that could compromise system security or leak data. The obfuscated variable names do not impact security but may hinder readability.",
