{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring installation and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'HISTORY.rst' files for long descriptions, defines dependencies in lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external data outputs or network communications.",
  "flows": "Reads files (sources) for description variables; passes dependencies and metadata to setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names; no apparent hardcoded secrets or credentials; no obfuscated code; no suspicious code logic.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily performs standard setup configuration for packaging, including reading description files and defining dependencies. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated or non-descriptive but do not suggest malicious intent. The dependencies listed are common Python packages. No code executes external commands, network communication, or untrusted data handling. The setup parameters are typical for a Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to hinder readability but not malicious. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
