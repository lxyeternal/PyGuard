  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, configuring dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'HISTORY.rst' files; static dependency lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external communication or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Static data flow from files into variables; no external or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical 'setup.py' script with superficial obfuscation in variable names. It performs standard package setup tasks without dynamic input, network activity, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, with superficial obfuscation and no malicious intent. The assigned malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is approximately 0.75 reflecting variable name obscurity, and the security risk score is around 0.1 due to obfuscation but no actual threat.",
