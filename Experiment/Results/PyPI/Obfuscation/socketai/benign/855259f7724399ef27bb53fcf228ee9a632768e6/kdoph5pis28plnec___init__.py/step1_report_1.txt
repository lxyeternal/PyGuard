    "Import from a local module with a seemingly random name, potential attempt to hide malicious code",
    "No further code executing or transmitting data, but the import might be suspicious in context"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code assigns static strings to variables with obfuscated names, which could be a sign of hiding malicious intent or data. The import statement imports a module from the current package, which could be legitimate or malicious depending on the content of that module. There are no immediate signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file modifications, or data leaks, but the obfuscated variable names and local import raise suspicion about concealment. Without further context or the imported module code, the risk remains uncertain.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated with meaningless variable names and imports a local module. While there is no direct malicious activity visible, the obfuscation and import pattern warrant caution. It may be benign or could be part of a malicious payload hidden within local modules.",
