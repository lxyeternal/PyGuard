  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code for potential malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and data leakage, focusing on code structure, data sources, sinks, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static strings to obfuscated variables, import statement from a local module.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution or import of external/local modules, use of hardcoded personal data.",
  "flows": "Assignment of personal data and obfuscated variables -> import statement from local module.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, hardcoded personal info, relative import from local module, minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static strings to variables with obfuscated names, indicating possible concealment. It imports a local module, which could execute arbitrary code if malicious. The presence of hardcoded personal data (name and email) raises privacy concerns. No active malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification is evident. The import pattern and obfuscation suggest potential concealment but lack concrete malicious actions. The code's benign appearance combined with obfuscation warrants cautious review of the imported module and context.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and contains personal data, which could be exploited if combined with malicious modules. However, no direct malicious activity is present. The overall security risk is moderate, with a low malware likelihood. Vigilance is advised, especially regarding the imported module. Final scores: malware: 0.2, obfuscated: 0.75, security risk: 0.4.",
