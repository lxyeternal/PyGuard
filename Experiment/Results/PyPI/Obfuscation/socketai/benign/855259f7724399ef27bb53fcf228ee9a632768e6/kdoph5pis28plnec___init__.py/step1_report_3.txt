{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the declaration of some variables, likely for identification or configuration, and an import statement from a local module.",
  "sources": "Variables are assigned static string values; the import statement reads from a local module in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions. The import could potentially load malicious code if the module is compromised, but this is a normal operation.",
  "flows": "No complex data flows are present; variables are assigned static data, and the import statement loads a module, with no untrusted data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are nonsensical or obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but they contain no executable or malicious code. The import statement references a local module, which is standard; no hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static strings to variables with seemingly obfuscated names and imports a local module. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious commands. The variable names do not follow meaningful patterns but do not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The import statement is typical and points to a local module; no dynamic code execution or suspicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, consisting of variable assignments and a local import. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but do not contain harmful code or malicious intent.",
