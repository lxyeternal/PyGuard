  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, dictionary definitions for package data, and setup() function call with parameters.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function executes with the provided arguments; no direct untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Definitions of package metadata and dependencies flow into setup(), which executes the installation process.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior detected. Variables are obfuscated but are just placeholders or meaningless names; no hardcoded credentials or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but their content is typical for package metadata. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious activities are evident. The dependencies and metadata are consistent with normal package configuration. The obfuscated variable names are likely to hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No external network activity, code execution beyond setup, or suspicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, obfuscated setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate package configuration with no malicious intent.",
