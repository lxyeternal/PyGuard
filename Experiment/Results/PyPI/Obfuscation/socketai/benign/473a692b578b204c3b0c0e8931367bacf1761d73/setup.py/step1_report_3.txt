  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'c7th31nujlx7x2xt' including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Variables containing package metadata, dependency lists, and configuration dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call which processes the provided configuration data.",
  "flows": "Metadata and dependency variables feed into the setup() function to define package properties.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code or unusual patterns observed. The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and defines multiple variables with seemingly obfuscated names containing package metadata, dependencies, and configuration options. These variables are passed into the setup() function, which is typical for Python package setup scripts. No dynamic code execution, external data fetching, or suspicious logic is present. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent. The dependencies and metadata seem legitimate, with no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Overall, this appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely to deter casual reading but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a conventional setup.py configuration with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The code does not perform any suspicious actions or data leaks. It is a benign package setup configuration.",
