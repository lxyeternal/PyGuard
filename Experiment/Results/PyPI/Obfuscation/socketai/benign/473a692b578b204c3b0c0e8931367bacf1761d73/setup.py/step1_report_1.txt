  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Variables defining package configuration (e.g., 'zivDpBsLDPzqZkjbjXLdGRVVRspHZMFx', 'uFtDtBUeEVhEloMnmqryDtQYJJpryPDq', etc.), and the 'setup' function call.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup' function invocation, which uses the configuration data to install or prepare the package.",
  "flows": "Variables are assigned package data, which are then passed directly to 'setup()' to define the package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names with seemingly random strings; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code evident. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. It imports 'setup' from setuptools, defines package metadata, dependencies, and other configuration data as variables, and then calls 'setup()' with these variables unpacked. The variable names do not suggest malicious intent, and there are no signs of code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. All data and dependencies seem legitimate and related to package configuration. No suspicious network activity or malicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, obfuscated setup configuration for a Python package with no indications of malicious behavior or malware. It is likely part of a legitimate package deployment process. The obfuscation appears to be solely in variable naming, not in malicious code.",
