  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Code Overview:**\n- Defines a custom exception class inheriting from `Exception`.\n- Constructor accepts a string and two objects from imported modules.\n- Stores these parameters internally.\n- `__str__` method formats an error message including these attributes.\n- Imports are from local modules, with obfuscated class names.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Define a custom exception for column-matching errors.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious behavior; straightforward exception class.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues. Score is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, with mention of obfuscated variable names.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation noted but no malicious activity. No external data flows.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Obfuscation raises suspicion but no evidence of malicious intent. The low malware score is appropriate. Slightly elevated security risk due to obfuscation is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Similar, standard exception class.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard exception handling.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Well justified. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same as above, with mention of obfuscated variable names.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation noted but no malicious behavior. No external data flows.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with previous reports. Obfuscation alone isn't malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Similar, with focus on obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity; standard exception class.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** The low malware score aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code's benign nature.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slightly high (0.7) in some reports due to variable naming, which is acceptable as an indicator of obfuscation but not malicious.\n- **Risk scores:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1), consistent with the absence of actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- The scores are generally reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- The only point to consider is whether the obfuscation scores should be slightly higher or lower, but given the context, 0.7 is acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall conclusion:**\n- The code is a straightforward, benign exception class.\n- No malware, no malicious obfuscation, no security risks.\n- The scores are justified and aligned with the detailed analysis.\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (consistent with the reports)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to obfuscation but no actual risk)\n\nThis comprehensive review confirms the code's benign nature and justifies the scoring.",
