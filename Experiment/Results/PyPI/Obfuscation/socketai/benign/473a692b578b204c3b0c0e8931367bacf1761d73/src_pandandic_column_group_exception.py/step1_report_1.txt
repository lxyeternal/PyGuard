{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling specific column-matching errors in a data processing context.",
  "sources": "The class initializes with string input and references to imported classes for column groups, which are not shown in detail.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data output operations are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to internal variables and used in string representation; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are observed. Imports are from local modules, which could be benign or malicious, but cannot be judged without further context.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class with custom attributes for detailed error reporting. It does not perform any I/O, network activity, or data manipulation that could be malicious. The imported modules are not shown; if they contain malicious code, it is outside the scope of this snippet. The class's string method formats an error message using internal state, which is standard. Overall, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward custom exception definition with no malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware or obfuscated code and poses no security threat based on the given snippet.",
