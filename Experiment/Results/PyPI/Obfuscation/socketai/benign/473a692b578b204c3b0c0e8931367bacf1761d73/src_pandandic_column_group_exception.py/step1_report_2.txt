{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for errors related to column matching in a data processing context.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.column_set and .column), class initialization parameters, and string formatting in __str__ method.",
  "sinks": "String representation (__str__) potentially exposing internal state, but no data sinks or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in instance variables and later used in __str__ for display; no data flows outside the class.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., uEhlkbPlBMAYGiDUqFNTfVCQJJfYOqwe), but this appears to be code obfuscation rather than malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with a constructor that assigns parameters to internal variables and a __str__ method for message formatting. No external data sources or sinks are present. The obfuscated variable names suggest code obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent. The import statements reference local modules, which do not raise security concerns without further context. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of an exception class with obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated-looking exception class definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger codebase with obfuscated variable names, but on its own, it poses no security threats.",
