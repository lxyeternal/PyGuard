{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for column matching errors, storing relevant data and providing a formatted error message.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in constructor: a string and two objects from imported modules.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method generates a string message; no external data flow or network activity.",
  "flows": "Constructor assigns parameters to internal variables; __str__ accesses these variables to produce the message.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; imports from local modules whose contents are unknown.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with internal state and string representation. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. Obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The imports are from local modules, but since only class references are used, no external malicious behavior is evident. The code's purpose is error reporting, with no suspicious logic or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purpose-specific, and free of malicious behavior. Obfuscation is likely stylistic. The scores reflect this: malware score 0, obfuscated score approximately 0.7, and low security risk (~0.1). No further action is necessary.",
