  "purpose": "Define a dataclass that holds various type annotations, potentially for validation or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and a local module; class attribute initialization.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no handling of untrusted data or external outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; no processing of external input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import (.defined_later) which could indicate dynamic or deferred import; no apparent security concern but requires awareness. The class includes type annotations and attributes, but no malicious code or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for dataclass and typing, along with a relative import from a local module. It defines a dataclass with attributes that accept different Union types, including a list of strings and classes. The __set_name__ method assigns a name attribute, which is standard for descriptors. There are no functions executing external commands, network operations, or handling untrusted input. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. The structure appears to be for configuration or validation purposes, with no evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward dataclass definition intended for type handling or validation. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The relative import should be reviewed in the larger context, but alone, this code fragment appears safe.",
