{
  "purpose": "Define a data class with a list of members that can be of two specific imported types.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.column and .column_set), and the class attribute 'members'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or leaked; no output or external communication.",
  "flows": "The class holds references to imported classes; no data flow from external input to output observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures. The method __set_name__ simply assigns a name attribute.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific types from local modules and defines a data class with a list of unioned member types. The __set_name__ method is a standard descriptor method, used when the class is a descriptor or for other advanced behaviors. There are no external data inputs, no suspicious code execution, no obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors. The code appears to be a straightforward class definition for data structure purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign, standard data class with no malicious intent or security risks identified. No suspicious behavior or malicious code detected.",
