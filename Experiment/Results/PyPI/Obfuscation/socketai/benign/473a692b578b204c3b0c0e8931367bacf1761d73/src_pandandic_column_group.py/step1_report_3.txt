{
  "purpose": "Define a data class with a list of members that can include specific imported classes, and assign a name to instances of the class.",
  "sources": "The code reads from imported modules (.column and .column_set) and the 'members' attribute provided during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or write data to external systems; the only potential sink is attribute assignment within the class.",
  "flows": "Input data (members list) flows into the class attribute, but no further flow to external systems is present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic attribute naming with __set_name__, but no suspicious code, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. Imports are from local modules, which could be benign or part of a larger package.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class that holds a list of specific objects, possibly from local modules. The __set_name__ method is a standard Python hook for descriptors, but here it's used to assign a name attribute. No data sanitization, external input handling, or risky behaviors are evident. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a simple, legitimate class definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward data class definition with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application that manages objects of certain types.",
