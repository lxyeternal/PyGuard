  "conclusion": "The import statements are highly obfuscated, which warrants caution. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity or malware in this snippet. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is high, and overall security risk is moderate due to potential concealment. Further analysis of the actual modules is advised to rule out hidden threats."
