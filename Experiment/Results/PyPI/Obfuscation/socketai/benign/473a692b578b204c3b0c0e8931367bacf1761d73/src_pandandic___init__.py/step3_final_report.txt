{
  "purpose": "The code contains only import statements from local modules with obfuscated names, with no executable logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from modules with obfuscated or nonsensical names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module names, which are unusual and suspicious, potentially used to conceal malicious or proprietary code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from modules with obfuscated names, indicating potential concealment. No functions, data processing, or network activity are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Malware score is 0, reflecting no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation score is high (~0.75), indicating suspicion. Security risk score is low (~0.3), acknowledging obfuscation concerns but no active threats. The scores are consistent with the limited evidence, and further review of module contents is recommended to determine if malicious code is hidden.",
  "conclusion": "The import statements are highly obfuscated, which warrants caution. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity or malware in this snippet. The scores assigned are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is high, and overall security risk is moderate due to potential concealment. Further analysis of the actual modules is advised to rule out hidden threats.",
