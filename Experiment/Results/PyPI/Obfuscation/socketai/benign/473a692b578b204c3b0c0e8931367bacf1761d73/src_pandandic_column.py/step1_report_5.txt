{
  "purpose": "Define a data class with a property that returns a specific attribute or the class name, possibly for use as a descriptor.",
  "sources": "Import from '.defined_later' module; access to class attributes within the data class.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data output or system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "No clear source-to-sink data flow; the code primarily sets and retrieves class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a placeholder import from a module named '.defined_later' suggests the code is incomplete or meant for dynamic definition; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with a generic type attribute and an optional union attribute referencing an imported class. The __set_name__ method sets a 'name' attribute, and a property returns either a stored attribute or the name. There are no external data inputs, network calls, or system modifications. The import from '.defined_later' indicates incomplete or placeholder code, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The overall structure is straightforward and does not contain obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign class definition with no malicious intent. It likely functions as a descriptor or configuration holder. No security risks or malware are identified.",
