{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class with type annotations and a property that returns either an attribute value or its name, with an external import suggesting deferred or dynamic code.",
  "sources": "Import from '.defined_later', class attributes, property method accessing class attributes",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, network activity, or system modifications",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes to property getter; no external data flow or untrusted input handling observed",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; import from a placeholder module '.defined_later'; no actual malicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code is a structurally benign data class with obfuscated identifiers and a dynamic import that could be used to conceal intent. No network, file, or system operations are evident. The obfuscation and placeholder import are typical of code meant for dynamic or incomplete systems but do not constitute malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the obfuscation but do not find evidence of malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are high due to naming, and risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature. The code's lack of active malicious payloads or vulnerabilities supports a conclusion of low threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data class with no malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified by naming and import style but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe in isolation.",
