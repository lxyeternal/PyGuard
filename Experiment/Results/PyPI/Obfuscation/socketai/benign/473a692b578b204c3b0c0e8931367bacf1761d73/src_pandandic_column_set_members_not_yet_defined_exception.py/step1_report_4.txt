{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class that uses an imported object as part of its error message.",
  "sources": "Import from the local module '.column_set', and the exception class constructor accepting an object of type 'wQUaVfOjQbejmYAwjBwpvVKprXRQmjPb'.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs a string in __str__, but it does not perform any unsafe operations or data leaks.",
  "flows": "The exception is initialized with a 'column_set' object and when converted to string, it accesses the 'name' attribute of that object.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; no obvious malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class from a local module, defines a custom exception that takes an object as input, and provides a string representation including an attribute of that object. All operations appear to be straightforward and typical for custom exceptions. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The obfuscated names suggest either deliberate concealment or code generated by an obfuscator, but this alone is not suspicious without additional context. No dangerous operations or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines a custom exception class with obfuscated naming, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
