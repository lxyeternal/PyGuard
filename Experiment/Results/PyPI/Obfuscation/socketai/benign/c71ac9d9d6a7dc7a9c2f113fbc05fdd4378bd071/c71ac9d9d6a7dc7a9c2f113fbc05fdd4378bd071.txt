      "conclusion": "The script is a standard build setup with obfuscation and reliance on environment variables for executing system commands. No evidence of malicious activity or payloads is present. The main concern is the potential exploitation if environment variables are manipulated, warranting cautious review. The scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is low, obfuscation is high, and security risk is moderate due to environment dependence."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious activity or backdoors. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is very low. Obfuscation is moderate and appears cosmetic rather than malicious. The supply chain security posture is sound based on this analysis."
