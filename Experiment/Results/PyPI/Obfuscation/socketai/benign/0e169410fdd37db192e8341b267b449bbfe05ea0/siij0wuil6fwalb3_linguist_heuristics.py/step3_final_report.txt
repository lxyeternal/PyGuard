  "purpose": "Pattern matching and disambiguation based on YAML configuration files, primarily used for filtering or detection purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads pattern definitions and rules from external YAML files ('heuristics.yml'), compiles regex patterns, and matches input strings.",
  "sinks": "Regex pattern compilation and string matching; no external system modifications, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Pattern definitions loaded from YAML -> regex compiled -> input strings matched against patterns.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; reliance on external YAML configuration could be exploited if malicious YAML content is supplied.",
  "analysis": "The code loads pattern rules from YAML, compiles regex objects, and performs string matching. Obfuscation of class and method names is notable but not inherently malicious. No network, file system, or system modification actions are present. The pattern matching logic is standard and benign. The main concern is the integrity of the external YAML configuration, which could be manipulated to introduce malicious patterns, but the code itself does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign pattern matching utility loaded from configuration files. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious system behavior. Obfuscation is present but likely for concealment or code protection rather than malicious intent. The primary security consideration is ensuring the integrity of the YAML configuration, not the code itself.",
