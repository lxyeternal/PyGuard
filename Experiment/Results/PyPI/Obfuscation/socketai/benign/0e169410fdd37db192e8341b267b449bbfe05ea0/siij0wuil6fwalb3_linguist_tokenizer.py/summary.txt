  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated utility for tokenizing Python source code with comment removal. While obfuscation is notable, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or payloads. The overall malware risk is minimal, with high obfuscation scores justified by naming conventions. The security risk remains low, and the code does not exhibit malicious intent."
