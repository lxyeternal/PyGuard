  "purpose": "A Python utility for tokenizing source code, removing comments, and representing tokens with heavily obfuscated class and method names.",
  "sources": "Reading source code input via tokenize.generate_tokens, processing token types and values, and stripping comments using regex.",
  "sinks": "Potentially none; no external data transmission or malicious payloads detected.",
  "flows": "Source input (code string) -> tokenization via generate_tokens -> token objects created -> comment removal regex applied.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names; simplistic regex for comment removal; no external or network activity; no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard tokenization and comment stripping for Python code, with obfuscated naming possibly to conceal purpose. No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration. The regex for comment removal is basic but not malicious. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive of malicious intent. The scores across reports are consistent, assigning low malware risk (around 0.1-0.2), high obfuscation (around 0.8), and low security risk (around 0.2-0.3).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated utility for tokenizing Python source code with comment removal. While obfuscation is notable, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or payloads. The overall malware risk is minimal, with high obfuscation scores justified by naming conventions. The security risk remains low, and the code does not exhibit malicious intent.",
