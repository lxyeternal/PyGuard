  "purpose": "Detect programming languages in code files within a directory or file, providing detailed statistics or JSON output.",
  "sources": "User input path, os.walk for directory traversal, mimetypes.guess_type for MIME type detection.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data leaks, network communication, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input path -> directory traversal -> MIME type detection -> language analysis -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and function names, inconsistent exception handling, references to undefined variables ('file_path', 'path'), malformed code snippets, suspicious naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static analysis for language detection, utilizing external modules and standard libraries. Obfuscation and syntax issues suggest poor coding practices or deliberate concealment. No evidence of malicious actions such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. Exception handling is inconsistent, referencing undefined variables, which could lead to runtime errors. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated static analysis utility for language detection, with no signs of malicious behavior. The primary concern is obfuscation and potential runtime errors, not malware. Scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscation score approximately 0.75, security risk low (~0.2). Caution is advised if executing or deploying, but current evidence does not indicate malicious activity.",
