  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated static analysis utility for language detection, with no signs of malicious behavior. The primary concern is obfuscation and potential runtime errors, not malware. Scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscation score approximately 0.75, security risk low (~0.2). Caution is advised if executing or deploying, but current evidence does not indicate malicious activity."
