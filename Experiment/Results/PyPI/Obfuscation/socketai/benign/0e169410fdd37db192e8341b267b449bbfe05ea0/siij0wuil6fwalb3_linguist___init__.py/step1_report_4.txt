{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or computation, but without specific context or comments, its purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "It reads input from the 'input_data' variable or function, and potentially from environment variables or external sources if used within the code.",
  "sinks": "Data is written or returned via 'output_data' or similar variables; no clear external communication or network activity is evident from the code snippets provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions or operations and then to output variables or return statements.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors such as network calls, file modifications, or cryptographic manipulations are evident. The code structure appears standard and lacks obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed comprehensively, including its beginning, middle, and end segments. No malicious patterns or security risks such as code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices are present. Usage of third-party libraries seems legitimate and necessary for functionality. No anomalies indicating malicious intent were detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard, functional, and free of malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
