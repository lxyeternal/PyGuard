  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Input is read from function arguments, environment variables, or external libraries; no explicit data sources identified in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "Data outputs to console, logs, or network connections via requests or socket communication; no explicit sensitive sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, but no malicious or suspicious flow patterns are evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code constructs observed. The code structure appears typical of utility scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python libraries and patterns. There are no signs of malicious activity such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No obfuscated or suspicious behavior detected. Without more context or hidden code, the overall risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies observed.",
