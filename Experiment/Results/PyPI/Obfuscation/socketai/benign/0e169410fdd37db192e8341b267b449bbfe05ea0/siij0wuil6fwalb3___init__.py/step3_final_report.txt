  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, external data sources, and code modules.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variable access, data transmission, and system modifications.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing functions, network calls, or environment variable reads.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack concrete code snippets, relying on descriptions. The assessments correctly identify no malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious patterns. Risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting conservative caution given limited information. Confidence levels vary but are appropriate based on the available descriptions. No evidence suggests malicious intent or significant security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are consistent with their findings, indicating benign code with no malicious or obfuscated elements. The scoring system accurately reflects the low risk profile. No adjustments are necessary; scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low risk (~0.1-0.2) are justified given the limited data.",
