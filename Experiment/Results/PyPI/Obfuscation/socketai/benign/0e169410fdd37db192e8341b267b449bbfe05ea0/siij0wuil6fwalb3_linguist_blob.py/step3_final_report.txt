  "purpose": "A utility class for reading files, detecting encoding, and managing blob interactions through an obfuscated interface.",
  "sources": "File open/read operations, encoding detection via chardet, interactions with BlobHelper properties and methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential data handling via BlobHelper; no network, system modification, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "File content read -> encoding detection -> content stored in class attribute -> delegated to BlobHelper for storage or retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and method names; no explicit malicious code, but obfuscation could conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code reads files, detects encoding, and interacts with an external BlobHelper, which could perform storage or network operations. No network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads are evident. Obfuscation is present but not inherently malicious. The malware score is zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. The risk score is low (~0.2-0.3), justified by obfuscation but no concrete malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution, but static analysis alone does not reveal malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated file and blob management utility. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is detected. The high obfuscation suggests caution, but based solely on this fragment, the security risk remains low.",
