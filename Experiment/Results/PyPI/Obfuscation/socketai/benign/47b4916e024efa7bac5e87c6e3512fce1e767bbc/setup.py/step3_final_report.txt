{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and data without dynamic behavior.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments for package name, version, URLs, and package data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration data without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and a suspicious-looking package name ('y8pxc2fqsfqk3vaz'), superficial obfuscation without malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and static data. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly to conceal variable purposes. The package name string is unusual but not inherently malicious. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The superficial obfuscation and suspicious package name warrant cautious review if encountered unexpectedly, but static analysis shows no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation and no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation and unusual package name should prompt cautious review in broader contexts, but based solely on this code, it is safe.",
