  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package related to mysqlclient typing stubs.",
  "sources": "Reads static string values, import statements, and setup() parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no use of untrusted data or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Static strings are assigned to variables and passed directly to setup(); no dynamic data flow or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that seem obfuscated or randomly generated; no apparent malicious logic or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls setup() with predefined, static parameters. Variables with obfuscated names contain hardcoded strings. The setup() function includes typical package metadata with no signs of malicious activity. No external data, network calls, or dynamic code execution is present. The obfuscated variable names may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but they contain benign static data. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent. No security risks or malware are detected based on the static analysis of this code.",
