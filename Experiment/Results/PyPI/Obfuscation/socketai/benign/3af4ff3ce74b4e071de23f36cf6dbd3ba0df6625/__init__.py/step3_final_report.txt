  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, external data sources, network sockets, files, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file writes, system commands, environment variables, external services.",
  "flows": "From data sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, files, subprocesses).",
  "anomalies": "Minor obfuscation suspicion in some reports; no hardcoded secrets, suspicious backdoors, or malicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious patterns. Scores are generally consistent with the described behavior. Minor obfuscation suspicion (score 0.2) in report 3 is justified; other reports show no obfuscation or malware. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal threat. No significant anomalies or inconsistencies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis. Slightly lowering security risk scores from 0.2 to 0.1 across most reports could be considered, but current values are acceptable. Overall, the supply chain security posture is low risk.",
