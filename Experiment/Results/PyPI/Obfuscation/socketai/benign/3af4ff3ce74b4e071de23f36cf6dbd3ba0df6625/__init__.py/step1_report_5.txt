  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific task or function within a larger Python project, but the exact purpose cannot be determined from the provided snippet alone.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are likely obtained from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules; specific input sources are not explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file system writes, or execution functions if present, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Without concrete code, it is not possible to identify explicit data flow paths from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls visible in the provided snippet.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited due to lack of specific code content. No suspicious patterns, malicious code, or security issues are apparent from the available information. The structure appears standard, and usage of third-party libraries, if any, cannot be deemed suspicious without further context. No unusual or potentially malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code appears benign with no clear indicators of malicious intent or security risks. However, the lack of detailed code prevents a definitive assessment. Overall, there is a low likelihood of malicious behavior.",
