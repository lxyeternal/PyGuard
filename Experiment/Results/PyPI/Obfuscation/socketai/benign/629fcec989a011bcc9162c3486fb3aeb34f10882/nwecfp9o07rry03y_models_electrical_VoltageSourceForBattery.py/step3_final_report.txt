  "purpose": "Defines a subclass for battery voltage modeling based on state of charge and current inputs, inheriting from an imported model class.",
  "sources": "Reads 'soc' and 'ocv' parameters during initialization; accesses 'parameters.u[inputs['soc']]' during voltage calculation.",
  "sinks": "Updates internal 'current' and 'voltage' variables; raises exception if required inputs are missing.",
  "flows": "Input 'soc' and 'current' flow into validation and parameter lookup; resulting voltage is returned after updating internal state.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated class and variable names; no hardcoded secrets, network activity, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard input validation, parameter lookup, and state updates typical of simulation models. Obfuscation hinders readability but does not imply malicious intent. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The reliance on external parameters is typical for such models, assuming proper control. The exception handling for missing inputs is appropriate. Overall, the code appears benign with high obfuscation but no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated battery voltage model component with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. Obfuscation may serve proprietary purposes but does not constitute a security threat. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
