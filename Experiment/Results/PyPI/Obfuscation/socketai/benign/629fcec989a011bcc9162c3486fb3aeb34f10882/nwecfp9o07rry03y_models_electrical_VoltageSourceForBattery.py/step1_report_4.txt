  "purpose": "Define a subclass for a model with methods to set and retrieve voltage based on input current and state of charge.",
  "sources": "Reading input dictionary 'inputs' with keys 'current' and 'soc'; importing modules and classes; using hardcoded string variables.",
  "sinks": "Accessing self.parameters.u[inputs['soc']] to retrieve voltage; raising exceptions on invalid input keys.",
  "flows": "Input 'inputs' dictionary flows into WJXirqPgKoIemoyGAbIaMArCoyZUuCBF method, which accesses self.parameters.u with 'soc' value to determine voltage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and class names; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no network operations; no suspicious code flow; no obfuscated code techniques observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that initializes with parameters 'soc', 'ocv', and 'init_soc', setting voltage based on an imported parameter dictionary. The method WJXirqPgKoIemoyGAbIaMArCoyZUuCBF updates current and voltage based on provided inputs, raising an exception if inputs lack 'current' and 'soc'. The naming appears intentionally obfuscated but the logic is straightforward, involving parameter lookup and input validation. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard model class with obfuscated naming conventions, likely to hinder easy comprehension. No signs of malicious intent or security risks are detected. It performs parameter lookup and input validation without any suspicious side effects.",
