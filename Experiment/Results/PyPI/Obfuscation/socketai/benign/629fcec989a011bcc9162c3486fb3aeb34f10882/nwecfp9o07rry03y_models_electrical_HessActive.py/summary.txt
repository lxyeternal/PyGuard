  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, heavily obfuscated electrical simulation component with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation level is high but consistent with proprietary code, and data flows are typical for such models. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2)."
