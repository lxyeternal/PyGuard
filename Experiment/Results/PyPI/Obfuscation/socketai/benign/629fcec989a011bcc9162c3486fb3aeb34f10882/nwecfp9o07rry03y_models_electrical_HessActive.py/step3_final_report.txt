  "purpose": "Simulation of electrical components, specifically battery and circuit modeling within an electrical system.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary keys 'battery_current' and 'uc_current', data from internal module methods for voltage and current calculations.",
  "sinks": "Internal attributes 'voltage' and 'current' updated based on inputs; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Inputs are validated, then used to update internal state via method calls; data flows from inputs to internal attributes through method invocations.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names; no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from an external model, initializing electrical components. The method processes an 'inputs' dictionary, requiring specific keys, and updates internal voltage and current states based on method calls. The obfuscation is consistent with proprietary or complex simulation code, not necessarily malicious. No network, file I/O, or external communication is present. Input validation is performed, and the data flow appears standard for simulation models. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. The heavy obfuscation suggests proprietary code, but it does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, heavily obfuscated electrical simulation component with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation level is high but consistent with proprietary code, and data flows are typical for such models. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2).",
