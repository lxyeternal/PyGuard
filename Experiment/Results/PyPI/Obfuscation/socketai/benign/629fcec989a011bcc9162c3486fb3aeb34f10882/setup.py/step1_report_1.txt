  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, intended to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Import statements, variable assignments, setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "setup() function parameters, especially the license, version, dependencies, and other metadata.",
  "flows": "Imports and variable definitions are used in the setup() call to configure package info.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and imported functions with seemingly random names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obscure code flow. No actual malicious code or external network activity present. Use of potentially misleading variable names like 'NfsIiIZKBzfRgIqFVQYBjxLUaCsRgxGu' for the license parameter, but their content appears legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules and variables with obfuscated names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The setup() function call configures package metadata and dependencies with seemingly legitimate values. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscation might be for concealment, but it does not contain direct malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names that could be an attempt to conceal its intent. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in the provided code.",
