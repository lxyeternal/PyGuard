  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate set of simulation tests for electrical components, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation is likely for proprietary or complexity reasons, not malicious concealment. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high but justified, and the overall security risk is very low."
