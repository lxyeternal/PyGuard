  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated and employs dynamic features that could hide malicious intent, but no direct malicious activity is evident. It warrants further investigation into external dependencies and runtime behavior. Current scores are appropriate given the evidence, with moderate concern due to obfuscation."
