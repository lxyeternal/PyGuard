{
  "purpose": "This code models a battery or electrical component, updating state variables such as state of charge (soc), voltage, current, and temperature, likely for simulation purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as soc, ocv, init_soc, and external inputs like 'current' and 'step'.",
  "sinks": "Voltage and current calculations that depend on inputs; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs (e.g., 'current') influence voltage and soc; internal methods update state variables based on these inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names; no hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simulation model for a battery or electrical system, with obfuscated identifiers. It updates soc based on current flow, calculates voltage, and manages temperature. No malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. Obfuscation appears to be for proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. The code structure and logic are consistent with typical simulation modules, and no anomalies suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated battery simulation component with no signs of malicious intent. The high obfuscation score is justified, but it does not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2).",
