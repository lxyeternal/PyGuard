  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but legitimate electrical simulation module managing voltage, current, and SOC. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data leaks is present. The obfuscation level is high but superficial, likely for proprietary reasons. The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis."
