  "purpose": "Import version number and tuple conversion, and import specific classes from a local module",
  "sources": "Reading the string '0.2.0' and splitting it; importing classes from a relative module",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external communication",
  "flows": "Conversion of version string to tuple; import statements do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no obvious malicious code or suspicious behavior in the provided snippet",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version string, splits it, converts it to a tuple of integers, and imports specific classes from a local module. The variable names appear obfuscated, but the operations are straightforward: handling static data and importing modules. There are no inputs, no data leaks, no network activity, or other suspicious behaviors present. The code appears to be part of a larger, possibly obfuscated, package, but within this fragment, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple data handling and module imports with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
