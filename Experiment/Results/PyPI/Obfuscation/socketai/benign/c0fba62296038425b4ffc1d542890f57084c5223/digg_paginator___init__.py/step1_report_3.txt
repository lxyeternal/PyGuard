{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to a variable and converts it into a tuple of integers, then imports specific classes from a local module named 'paginators'.",
  "sources": "Reads version string from hardcoded variable; imports from local module 'paginators'.",
  "sinks": "Import statement may load code from local module; no external data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "Version string is parsed into integers, then code imports classes from 'paginators' module; no data flow to external sources or sinks beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a hardcoded version string and dynamic import from a local module, which is standard; no anomalies or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a version string and converts it into a tuple of integers, which appears to be for version management or validation. The import statement loads classes from a local module named 'paginators'. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The code structure is straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment performs simple version parsing and imports modules in a standard manner. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It appears to be normal, benign code used for version handling and module importation.",
