  "purpose": "The code is a straightforward Python script performing data processing or utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables, files, or user input.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to network, files, or system resources, but no suspicious activity is observed.",
  "flows": "Input sources to processing functions, then to outputs or external systems, with no suspicious patterns.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, using standard libraries and patterns. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows are present. Multiple reports consistently indicate no malware, obfuscation, or high security risks, with confidence levels generally above 0.6. The security risk score of 0.2 is conservative but acceptable given the benign assessment. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious patterns support a conclusion of low threat.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided descriptions and consistent assessments, the code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, the obfuscated score to 0, and the security risk score to 0.2. These scores are justified and align with the analyses. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
