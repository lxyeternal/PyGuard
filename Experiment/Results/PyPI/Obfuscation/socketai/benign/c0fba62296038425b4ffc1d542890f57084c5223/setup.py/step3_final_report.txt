{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names and encoded contact info, likely intended to conceal details but not malicious.",
  "sources": "Static strings assigned to variables, including package metadata and encoded contact info; no dynamic input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; no network, file, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Static variable assignments used in setup() call; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, encoded-looking contact info, and a syntax error in the assignment of the email string ('=' outside proper syntax). The syntax error indicates malformed code or obfuscation attempt.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal setup script with superficial obfuscation through variable naming and encoded strings. The syntax error in the email assignment suggests either poor obfuscation or a mistake. No malicious code, network activity, or system modifications are present. The obfuscation appears intended to hinder readability but does not constitute malicious behavior. The syntax flaw is significant and would prevent execution if run as-is, indicating poor coding or obfuscation. The package URL points to a legitimate repository, and no active malicious intent is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. The superficial obfuscation and syntax error suggest either intentional concealment or coding mistakes, but no malicious behavior is detected. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is moderate (~0.5), and security risk is low (~0.2).",
