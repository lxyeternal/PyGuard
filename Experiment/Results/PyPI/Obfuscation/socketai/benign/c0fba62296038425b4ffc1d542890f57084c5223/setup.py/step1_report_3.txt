{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'i02vauby16ecmhal' with metadata including version, maintainer, and download URL.",
  "sources": "The script reads static metadata for package setup, including maintainer email, version, and download URL.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data is processed or output; the code primarily defines static data for setup.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'GBhsyjXpIyCbydSiBCBwKwjzjIJgIAXM=' appears to be a base64-encoded string, likely an obfuscated email, but no malicious activity is evident. The use of unusual variable names and obfuscation could be suspicious but may also be intentional for code obfuscation or to hinder readability.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with intentionally obfuscated variable names. The email address is base64-encoded, which is a common obfuscation technique but not inherently malicious. There is no network activity, code injection, or malicious behavior observed. The download URL points to a GitHub repository, which is common for package distribution. No suspicious logic or hidden backdoors are present. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, but it warrants cautious review in a real scenario.",
  "conclusion": "This setup script appears to be a legitimate package configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no clear evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code.",
