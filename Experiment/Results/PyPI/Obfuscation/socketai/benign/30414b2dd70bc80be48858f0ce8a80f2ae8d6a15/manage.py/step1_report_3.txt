  "anomalies": "Use of setdefault to set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard Django entry point",
  "analysis": "The script sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable to a specific test settings module. It then imports and calls Django's management command execution function, passing command-line arguments. No suspicious data handling, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, and no obfuscated code. The code appears to be a typical Django entry point script used for testing or development purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Django management script used to execute commands with a specific settings module. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical usage patterns.",
