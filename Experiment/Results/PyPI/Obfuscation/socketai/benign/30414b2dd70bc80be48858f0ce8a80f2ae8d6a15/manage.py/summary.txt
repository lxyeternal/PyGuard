  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, standard Django management entry point with no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscated scores are appropriate. The slight security risk reflects the potential misuse if untrusted input is supplied, but this is typical for such scripts. Overall, the code is safe and well-understood."
