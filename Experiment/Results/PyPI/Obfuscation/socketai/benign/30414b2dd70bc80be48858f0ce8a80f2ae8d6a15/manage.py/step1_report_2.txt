  "purpose": "This script initializes the Django environment and executes command-line management tasks for a Django project.",
  "sources": "os.environ.setdefault to set environment variable, sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line, which executes Django management commands possibly based on untrusted input",
  "flows": "sys.argv (input) flows into execute_from_command_line, with environment variable set at the start",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, straightforward environment setup",
  "analysis": "The code sets a Django settings module, then invokes Django's command-line utility with arguments from sys.argv. No dynamic code execution beyond standard Django management commands, no suspicious data handling or network activity observed. Usage appears to be typical for Django management scripts.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard Django management launcher with no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
