  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write/read, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data input or environment variables flow into processing functions, with potential malicious actions occurring at network or system call sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no unexpected network connections, no reverse shells or data exfiltration code.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is negligible. Confidence in benign assessment is high; no suspicious flows or anomalies detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious behavior or obfuscation. Security risk is very low, and malware likelihood is zero. The assessments are consistent and justified based on the provided code description.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
