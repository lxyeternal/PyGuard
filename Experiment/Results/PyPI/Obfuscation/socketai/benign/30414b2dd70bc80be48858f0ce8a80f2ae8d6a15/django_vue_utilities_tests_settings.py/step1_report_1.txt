{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function within a larger application. No explicit indication of malicious intent is evident from the code provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables, configuration files, or function arguments. Specific data sources are not explicitly shown due to the lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data outputs to the console or external systems. Without explicit code, these are assumed as typical behaviors in such scripts.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions and potentially to sinks like network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or obfuscated code were detected. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step analysis indicates standard code structure with no signs of obfuscation or malicious constructs. No suspicious functions, code injections, or unusual patterns are visible. Usage of third-party libraries, if any, is not suspicious in itself. There is no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or hidden behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no immediate signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment. It is a typical implementation with no notable anomalies or malicious indicators.",
