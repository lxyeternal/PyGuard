{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple Python script that performs basic operations such as importing modules, defining functions, and executing some logic. There is no clear indication of malicious intent or harmful behavior.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, user input, or external modules imported at the beginning of the script.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network requests, file operations, or data outputs. The code should be checked for any use of subprocess, socket, or file handling functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, input) through processing functions to sinks (file writes, network calls).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and adheres to common patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with imports and function definitions, with no unusual or suspicious modules or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of data leakage, network connections, or file manipulation that could be malicious. The code does not contain any hardcoded secrets or credentials. All logic appears normal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard Python script with no suspicious activities.",
