  "purpose": "Configuration for documentation setup, including theme paths and project metadata.",
  "sources": "Static variable definitions, module imports (`sphinx_rtd_theme`), and metadata lists.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network communication, or file operations involving external input.",
  "flows": "None; all data is static and assigned at the module level.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static configuration variables, theme path retrieval, and metadata definitions. No dynamic data, user input, network activity, or code execution occurs. The obfuscated variable names are likely stylistic or for minor concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. The import of `sphinx_rtd_theme` and the static data are typical for documentation setup. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities are present. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the low security risk scores reflect the benign nature of the code. Obfuscation scores are moderate, justified by variable naming but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code for documentation purposes, with obfuscated variable names that do not imply malicious intent. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
