  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a minimal, standard setup script importing 'setuptools' and calling 'setup()' with no arguments.\n- No external data sources, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated code, and no signs of malicious behavior are identified.\n- The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging practices.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Presence of issues:** The code in all reports is correct and safe; no issues are present.\n- **Errors or flaws:** None are identified; the reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - *malware:* all are 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n  - *securityRisk:* all are 0, which is reasonable.\n  - *obfuscated:* all are 0, matching the straightforward code.\n  - *confidence:* all are 1, indicating high certainty.\n\n**Justifications:**\n- The code is a canonical minimal setup script, with no suspicious or malicious elements.\n- No assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities beyond what is explicitly present.\n- The scores reflect the actual risk, malware, and obfuscation levels.\n\n**Potential adjustments:**\n- No score adjustments are necessary; the assessments are consistent and justified.\n\n**My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code is entirely benign, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**\n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard packaging boilerplate.\n- No further action needed.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical, safe setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate, and no modifications are warranted.",
