  "purpose": "The code is used to configure and initiate the setup process for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The 'setup()' function call as it reads the configuration when executed.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function can potentially load and process package metadata and dependencies, but no direct untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the setup() function executes with static configuration, no input/output data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The code is minimal and standard for packaging.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setup' function from setuptools and calls it with default parameters. There are no additional arguments, inputs, or dynamic code execution. This is a typical minimal setup script for packaging a Python module, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a basic package configuration without any suspicious activity.",
