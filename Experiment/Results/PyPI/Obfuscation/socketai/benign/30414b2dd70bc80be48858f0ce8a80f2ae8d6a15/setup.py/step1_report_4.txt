  "sinks": "No untrusted data or input handling; no data leaks or harmful actions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; setup() is called with default parameters and no additional logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; no unusual code, secrets, or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' library and calls the setup() function with default arguments, which is typical for a package's setup script. It does not process any external input, nor does it execute any malicious or suspicious actions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code is straightforward and adheres to common packaging conventions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard minimal setup script for a Python package with no malicious intent or security concerns identified.",
