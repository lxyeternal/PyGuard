{
  "purpose": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls its setup() function, which is used to define and install a Python package.",
  "sources": "The only source of data is the import statement for 'setuptools', which is a standard third-party library; no external input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function is a package installation and configuration call, not a data sink that processes untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only executes a package setup process.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard packaging practices with no unusual or suspicious elements. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution is present.",
  "analysis": "This is a basic setup script for a Python package, invoking setuptools to handle package installation or distribution. The code is minimal and uses standard library functions with no signs of malicious intent or anomalies. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script for Python packaging with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. It appears safe and standard.",
