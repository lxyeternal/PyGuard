  "anomalies": "Absence of anomalies; code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module and calls its 'setup()' function with default parameters. This is a standard pattern for packaging Python projects. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present. The code does not include any dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, network operations, or other suspicious constructs. The simplicity and standard nature of the code suggest no malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
