  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, obfuscation, and security issues based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network communication, file handling, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and user input flow into data processing, network communication, or file operations; no suspicious or malicious payloads detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns identified; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently identify the code as benign, with no malicious indicators, obfuscation, or suspicious data flows. The scores assigned—malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2—are appropriate given the limited context but no evidence of malicious activity. Confidence levels are high, and reasoning is cautious yet justified. No anomalies or vulnerabilities are evident, and the overall assessment aligns across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly likely safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. Scores are consistent and justified; no further action needed.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
