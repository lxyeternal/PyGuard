  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input streams, environment variables, files, network connections, dynamic execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data transmission, command execution, environment variable access, file/network I/O.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, dynamic eval/exec, network calls, environment reads.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (complex control flow, dynamic eval), suspicious variable names, hardcoded values, dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 exhibits obfuscation, dynamic execution, and complex control flow, justifying high obfuscation (0.8), malware suspicion (0.6), and security risk (0.65). Reports 2, 3, 4, and 5 show no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation, and benign behavior, with scores of 0 or low values, consistent with their descriptions. The scores align with the evidence, with Report 1's suspicion justified by obfuscation and dynamic patterns, while others are benign. No adjustments needed; the scores accurately reflect the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1's high obfuscation and dynamic execution suggest potential malicious intent, justified by scores. Other reports are benign, with low or zero scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent and appropriate, with no adjustments necessary.",
