  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, user input, network connections, system calls.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, environment variables, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, dynamic evaluation, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Potential dynamic code execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, obfuscation, cryptic variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no definitive malicious patterns; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscation detected. Dynamic evaluation functions are noted but not confirmed to be malicious. Limited code context reduces certainty, but overall, the code appears benign. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The risk is minimal, with potential concerns noted but unsubstantiated. Confidence is high where code is present; low where code is absent.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible. Scores are consistent with the analysis, reflecting a benign assessment.",
