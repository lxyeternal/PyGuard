{
  "purpose": "This code provides Django template tags to generate URLs for Vue.js frontend assets and to inject key-value pairs into the Vue app.",
  "sources": "Settings attributes (e.g., VUE_FRONTEND_DEV_SERVER_URL, VUE_FRONTEND_STATIC_PATH), input parameters 'bundle', 'key', 'value'.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that generate URLs or embed data into templates, potentially affecting the rendered HTML/JavaScript.",
  "flows": "Settings -> Function logic -> URL or HTML string output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. The second function has a commented-out block that appears incomplete or placeholder, but no malicious activity evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django template tags: one for generating asset URLs based on environment settings, and another for injecting key-value pairs into templates. It uses standard Django practices for URL and static path management. The first function dynamically constructs URLs for frontend assets, switching between dev server URLs and static files depending on settings. The second function appears to format key-value pairs for injection into Vue.js, but contains a comment with incomplete or placeholder code, which may indicate a code stub or partial implementation. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or code injection. No obfuscated code or suspicious network activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django utility for frontend asset management and data injection with no apparent malicious intent. It includes normal usage of settings and URL handling, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
