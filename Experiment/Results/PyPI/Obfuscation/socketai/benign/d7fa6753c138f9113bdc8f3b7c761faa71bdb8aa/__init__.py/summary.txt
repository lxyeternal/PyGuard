  "conclusion": "The dependency shows no malicious activity in reports 1, 3, and 4, with low malware and risk scores. Reports 2 and 5 indicate high suspicion of malicious behavior, justified by obfuscation and suspicious patterns, warranting higher malware (~0.75) and risk (~0.8) scores. The scoring is consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary."
