  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions within a Python package, with no explicit malicious intent evident.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules; specific data sources are not clearly shown due to lack of code content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file I/O, or subprocess calls if present, but no explicit sinks are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like output or external systems, but specific flow paths cannot be definitively identified without concrete code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors are evident in the provided code snippet. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are apparent.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code shows standard usage of Python constructs with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code does not include suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be standard, non-malicious Python code with no obvious security issues.",
