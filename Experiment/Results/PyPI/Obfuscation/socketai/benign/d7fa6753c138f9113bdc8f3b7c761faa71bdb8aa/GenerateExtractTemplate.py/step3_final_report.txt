  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, files, or network; code execution functions like eval(), subprocess calls, dynamic imports.",
  "sinks": "Execution of system commands, code evaluation, network communication, file access, environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Input sources (user/env/file) passed into eval()/subprocess/dynamic code, leading to potential code execution or data leakage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() and subprocess with untrusted input, dynamic code patterns, obfuscation indicators, minimal code context but high-risk functions.",
  "analysis": "The code contains high-risk functions such as eval() and subprocess calls with unvalidated input, indicating potential for remote code execution. Obfuscation scores are justified due to dynamic code patterns. The security risk score of 0.65 is appropriate, reflecting significant potential for exploitation. The malware score of 0.3 is reasonable but could be slightly increased to 0.4 to better represent the high-risk functions involved. Other reports show no suspicious activity, with scores aligned to their descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk patterns primarily due to insecure use of eval() and subprocess with untrusted input, warranting a malware score around 0.4 and a security risk of approximately 0.65. Slightly increasing the malware score from 0.3 to 0.4 improves alignment with the identified risks. Other reports are consistent and do not require adjustments.",
