  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk patterns primarily due to insecure use of eval() and subprocess with untrusted input, warranting a malware score around 0.4 and a security risk of approximately 0.65. Slightly increasing the malware score from 0.3 to 0.4 improves alignment with the identified risks. Other reports are consistent and do not require adjustments."
