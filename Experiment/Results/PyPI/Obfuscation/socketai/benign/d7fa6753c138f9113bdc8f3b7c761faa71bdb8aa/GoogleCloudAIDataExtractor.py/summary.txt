  "conclusion": "The code shows no direct malicious activity but is heavily obfuscated with flawed exception handling. The fallback to generateTemplate could be exploited if malicious, but no evidence supports this. The overall risk is low to moderate, with high obfuscation. The malware score remains at 0.2 to reflect potential concealment risk. Scores are consistent with the analysis; no major changes are necessary, but further review of generateTemplate is recommended."
