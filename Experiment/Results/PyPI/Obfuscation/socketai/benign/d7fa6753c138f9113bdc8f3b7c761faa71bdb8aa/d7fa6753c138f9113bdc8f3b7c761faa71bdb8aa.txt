      "conclusion": "The dependency shows no malicious activity in reports 1, 3, and 4, with low malware and risk scores. Reports 2 and 5 indicate high suspicion of malicious behavior, justified by obfuscation and suspicious patterns, warranting higher malware (~0.75) and risk (~0.8) scores. The scoring is consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate document processing utility with moderate security risks primarily due to external process invocation, input handling, and obfuscation. No explicit malware is detected, but the external subprocess calls and complex flow require careful validation and security hardening before deployment."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code shows no direct malicious activity but is heavily obfuscated with flawed exception handling. The fallback to generateTemplate could be exploited if malicious, but no evidence supports this. The overall risk is low to moderate, with high obfuscation. The malware score remains at 0.2 to reflect potential concealment risk. Scores are consistent with the analysis; no major changes are necessary, but further review of generateTemplate is recommended."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate document processing system with AI integrations. While its complexity and obfuscation warrant caution, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The main security risks involve environment variable handling, logging sensitive info, and lack of input validation. Overall, the system seems intended for document automation but should be monitored and secured properly."

      "obfuscated": 0.4,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk patterns primarily due to insecure use of eval() and subprocess with untrusted input, warranting a malware score around 0.4 and a security risk of approximately 0.65. Slightly increasing the malware score from 0.3 to 0.4 improves alignment with the identified risks. Other reports are consistent and do not require adjustments."
