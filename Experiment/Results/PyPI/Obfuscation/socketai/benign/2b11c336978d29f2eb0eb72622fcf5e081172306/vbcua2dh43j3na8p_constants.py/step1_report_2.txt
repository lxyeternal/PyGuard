  "purpose": "Define constants, configuration values, and lookup tables for a game or simulation module, including sound files, mathematical constants, color palettes, and character sets.",
  "sources": "Reading hardcoded string literals, numerical constants, tuple and list initializations, and dictionary definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks are present. The code primarily defines static data and constants.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only establishes internal constants and data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, possibly to conceal purpose. Some variables are generated via complex expressions, but they do not process untrusted input. No clear malicious activity or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily initializes numerous constants, tuples, lists, and dictionaries related to sound files, colors, math constants, and character sets. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which may suggest an attempt to hide intent or simply an obfuscation tactic. No code reads user input, network data, or performs file operations. No dynamic code execution, encryption, or suspicious patterns are evident. The use of constants appears consistent with game configuration or similar logic. Overall, no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This module is a static configuration and constants definition file with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project for a game or simulation. The obfuscation does not correlate with malicious activity.",
