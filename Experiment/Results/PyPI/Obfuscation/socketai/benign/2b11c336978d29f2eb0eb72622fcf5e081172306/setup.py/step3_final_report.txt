  "sources": "Static data in variables defining package info, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input, network activity, or secret handling present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static configuration only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation is likely superficial, possibly for concealment, but does not imply malicious intent. The static nature and standard dependencies further support benignity. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.7-0.8, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security threats are detected. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
