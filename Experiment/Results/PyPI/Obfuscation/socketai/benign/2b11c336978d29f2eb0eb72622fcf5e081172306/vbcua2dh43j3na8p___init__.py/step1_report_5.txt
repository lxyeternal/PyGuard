  "purpose": "Assigns a version string '1.1.1' to a variable with an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement assigning a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Input source (string assignment) flows into a variable; no further flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name is highly obfuscated, which can be a sign of concealment or obfuscation but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. The value assigned is a benign version string '1.1.1'. No external input, no data processing, no network activity, and no use of environment variables. The obfuscated name alone does not imply malicious intent, but it can be used to hide malicious code. However, as provided, the code appears benign and simple.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
