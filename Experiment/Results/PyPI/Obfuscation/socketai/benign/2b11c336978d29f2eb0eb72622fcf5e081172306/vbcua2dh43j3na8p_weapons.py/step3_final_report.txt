  "purpose": "Manage projectile behavior, visual effects, and sound effects in a game or simulation environment.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to class constructors, imported constants and functions, static sound file references.",
  "sinks": "Rendering functions, sound effect triggers, position updates based on physics calculations.",
  "flows": "Position updates from velocity and angle inputs; sound effects triggered based on material type; rendering effects based on internal state.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names, dynamic index access with try-except, no external data or network activity, static sound file references.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for projectile motion and visual effects with heavily obfuscated identifiers, likely to conceal implementation details. No network, file, or data exfiltration activity is present. The physics calculations and rendering calls are standard for game mechanics. Obfuscation is significant but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The absence of network activity, data leaks, or system modifications suggests benign purpose. The obfuscation may serve intellectual property protection or reverse engineering resistance.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a game or simulation module managing projectiles and effects, with heavy obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Malware score should be 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Obfuscation score is high (~0.75), justified by naming obscurity. Overall security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation but without malicious intent.",
