  "purpose": "Analysis of supply chain security and malicious behavior in Python dependencies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Descriptions of code complexity, obfuscation, dynamic execution, network interactions, and suspicious patterns; no actual code snippets provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic code execution, network calls, environment variable usage, subprocess or eval calls, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "From source indicators like obfuscation or untrusted inputs to sinks such as eval, subprocess, network connections, or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Signs of obfuscation, dynamic execution, unvalidated inputs, suspicious imports, or patterns like eval/subprocess without validation.",
  "analysis": "All reports are based on descriptions rather than concrete code snippets. Reports 1 and 4 show suspicion of obfuscation and dynamic behavior; reports 2, 3, and 5 are benign. Scores generally align with the suspicion levels. For Report 1, obfuscation and malware scores are reasonable; for Report 4, suspicion warrants moderate scores, but without confirmed malicious functions, these should be slightly lowered. Adjustments: reduce Report 4's obfuscated score to 0.1, malware to 0.1, and risk to 0.4. Other reports' scores are appropriate. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the descriptions, with minor adjustments to better reflect the absence of confirmed malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with some suspicion in Reports 1 and 4. Scores are generally justified; minor adjustments recommended for Report 4 to align with the lack of concrete malicious patterns. No evidence of active malware or confirmed obfuscation in the provided descriptions. Overall low to moderate risk.",
