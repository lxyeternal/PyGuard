{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to implement a Python package intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit malicious intent identified.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external modules. No user input or network input appears to be directly read.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include database operations, file writes, or network calls if present; however, in this code snippet, no such sinks are explicitly found.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and environment variables through processing functions; no evident source-to-sink flow leads to data exfiltration or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code are observed. Usage of external libraries is standard; no unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code structure includes standard function definitions, input handling, and data processing routines. No dynamic code execution, suspicious system calls, or malicious patterns are identified. The code is straightforward and follows typical design patterns for utility scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility module without hidden malicious intent.",
