  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a game launcher with network features and obfuscation. While suspicious patterns exist, especially the heavily obfuscated modules and socket server, no direct malicious payloads are detected. The potential for covert remote control or data exfiltration exists, but evidence is lacking. The overall security risk is moderate, and further static or dynamic analysis of the obfuscated modules and network traffic is recommended before deployment or integration into supply chain environments."
