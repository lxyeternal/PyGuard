{
  "purpose": "This code provides static methods to parse and generate documentation from Python docstrings, focusing on extracting sections like Args, Returns, and formatting them into tables.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string inputs representing docstrings, specifically the variables containing docstring content.",
  "sinks": "There are no external sinks or data flows involving untrusted data; the code operates solely on static strings.",
  "flows": "The functions process input strings to extract sections and generate formatted output, with no external data flow or system interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names such as 'aHhnmKkQHshLpwRhYMhDrmYjlJtpwTih' and 'gYfOYZUulrnFPsVmfBjuAHGwHDTtVZWN' are highly unusual and obfuscated, indicating placeholder or auto-generated naming.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward documentation utility that parses static docstrings and formats them. No malicious behavior, network activity, or external system calls are present. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but do not imply malicious intent; they likely serve as placeholders or are auto-generated. The logic is simple string processing, with no signs of malicious payloads or vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects the unusual naming, but the malware and security risk scores remain low due to the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign documentation parser with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not pose a security threat. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
