  "purpose": "Minimal code importing a local module and assigning a version string to an obfuscated variable name.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module; assignment of version string to variable",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external sinks or network activity",
  "flows": "No data flows; only local import and variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'uFtoTRmmhDIoziYraAhGwYxWhKnkgkWn', which appears as a nonsensical or auto-generated string",
  "analysis": "The code is syntactically correct, minimal, and performs only an import and a variable assignment. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or network activity are present. The variable name's obfuscation is noted but not indicative of malicious intent in this context. Malware scores are justified as zero; obfuscation scores are moderate due to the variable name but not suspicious enough to warrant high concern. Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The reasoning across reports is consistent and accurate, correctly identifying the lack of malicious activity and interpreting obfuscation as superficial. Slight adjustments to obfuscation scores could be made to reflect the benign context, but overall, the assessments are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The obfuscated variable name is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned are reasonable, and no changes are necessary. The overall security risk remains minimal.",
