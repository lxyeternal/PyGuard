{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import a module named 'doc_generator' and assign a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local module '.doc_generator', assignment of version string to 'uFtoTRmmhDIoziYraAhGwYxWhKnkgkWn'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only performs import and assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated-looking variable name; no apparent malicious intent but unusual naming could be suspicious or for obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module and assigns a version string to a variable with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name. There are no inputs, network calls, or data handling that suggest malicious behavior. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated but doesn't perform any malicious action on its own. No suspicious or harmful code constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, primarily importing a module and setting a version string. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual variable name could be for obfuscation or non-standard coding style, but does not imply malicious intent.",
