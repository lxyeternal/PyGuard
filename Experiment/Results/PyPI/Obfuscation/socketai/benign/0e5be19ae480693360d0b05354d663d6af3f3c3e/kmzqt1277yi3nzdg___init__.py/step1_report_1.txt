  "purpose": "Importing a class named DocGenerator from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import statement 'from .doc_generator import DocGenerator' and the assignment of a string version number.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no data output, network connections, or file writes observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code simply imports a module and assigns a string to a variable.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unusual variable name 'uFtoTRmmhDIoziYraAhGwYxWhKnkgkWn' that appears as a random or obfuscated string; no other suspicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local class 'DocGenerator' and assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There are no functions, logic, or data manipulations that suggest malicious intent. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated or randomly generated, which can sometimes be a red flag, but in this context, it does not execute or leak data. No suspicious network activity, no credential handling, and no malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable name alone does not indicate malicious intent in this minimal snippet.",
