{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a customizable logging framework with support for different logger types (standard and loguru) and includes detailed formatting and message wrapping.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, especially the logger name and type, as well as environment variables for configuration (not explicitly shown but implied through logger initialization). It also inspects the call stack to determine module names.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs log messages to console via colorlog handlers. No untrusted data is directly written to external systems or files in a malicious manner.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (logger names, types) flow into logger initialization; log messages generated via standard methods ('info', 'debug', etc.) pass through wrapper functions that add contextual info before logging.",
  "anomalies": "The code employs inspect to retrieve caller module names and wraps logging methods to include class and function context. It uses obfuscated class and variable names, which may hinder readability but are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a logging setup that can support multiple logger types, with custom formatting and dynamic method wrapping to include context info in logs. It uses standard libraries like logging and colorlog, with no external or unsafe code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity observed. The obfuscation of class and variable names appears to be an attempt to conceal intent but does not translate to malicious behavior. There is no evidence of malware or malicious payloads, and the security risk appears minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated logging setup with obfuscated naming. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on static analysis. The primary concern is its obfuscation, which may hinder code comprehension but does not indicate malicious intent.",
