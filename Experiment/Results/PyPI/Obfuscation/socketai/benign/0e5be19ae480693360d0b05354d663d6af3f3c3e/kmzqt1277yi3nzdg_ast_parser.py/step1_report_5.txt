  "purpose": "The code appears to be an AST parser utility for analyzing Python code structures, such as extracting docstrings, source code, and arguments from AST nodes.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters, AST nodes, and logs information via an imported logger.",
  "sinks": "Uses logging for debug/info messages, and ast.unparse for converting AST nodes back to source code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from AST nodes to string outputs via functions like iSVNCnJxfFyFvwHTSkZnVODRboDLsOVr and CZVVfKxVqgZUdVwToUTTZJsJuJzkWdBs; inputs are processed and logged but no external or untrusted sources are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names suggest code obfuscation. Use of dynamic class instantiation and method calls with non-descriptive names. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are present. There are minor inconsistencies in variable naming and string formatting, but nothing malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for parsing and analyzing AST nodes with methods to extract docstrings, function argument names, and source code from AST nodes. It utilizes a logger instance for logging activities. The presence of obfuscated class and method names indicates an attempt to obscure intent, but the logic itself is straightforward, focused on AST analysis. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious payloads. The code structure and functions are typical for code analysis tools, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an AST analysis utility without malicious intent. The obfuscated naming appears to be an attempt at concealment but does not indicate malicious behavior. No malware or security risks are detected based on this code segment.",
