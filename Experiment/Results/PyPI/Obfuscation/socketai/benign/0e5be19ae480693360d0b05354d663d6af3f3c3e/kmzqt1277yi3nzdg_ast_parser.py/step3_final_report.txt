  "purpose": "A utility class for parsing Python AST nodes to extract docstrings, source code, and function arguments.",
  "sources": "AST nodes passed to static methods for extracting docstrings, source code, and arguments.",
  "sinks": "Logging functions; no external data transmission or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input AST nodes flow through extraction functions; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, typographical errors (e.g., 'docstring' used without assignment, inconsistent variable names like 'source' vs 'dbuVWuKcPHmBvjvdTwWcbYiRHLsNLnjF'), repeated logger instantiations, poor code quality.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of utility functions for analyzing AST nodes, primarily extracting docstrings, source code, and arguments. It uses an obfuscated logger class instantiated multiple times, with typographical errors indicating poor coding practices. No network activity, code execution, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment rather than malicious intent. The use of 'ast.unparse' and logging is standard for static analysis tools. No external data flows or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for static analysis of Python code, with obfuscated naming and minor errors. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the overall security risk is very low.",
