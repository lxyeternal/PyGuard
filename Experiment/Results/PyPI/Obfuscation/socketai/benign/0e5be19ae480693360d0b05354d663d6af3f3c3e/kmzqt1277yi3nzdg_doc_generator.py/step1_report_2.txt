  "purpose": "Documentation generation from Python source files, including processing directories and individual files.",
  "sources": "File system (reading source directories and files), logging setup, processing input parameters such as show_code, log_level, max_workers.",
  "sinks": "Potential writing of documentation files to the target directory, logging output.",
  "flows": "Source: reading source code files and configuration inputs; Sink: writing documentation files and logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior observed. The code primarily handles file processing and logging setup. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or obfuscation detected. No dynamic code execution, suspicious imports, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a high-level description of a documentation generator class with methods for initialization, directory processing, and single-file processing. The code includes standard practices such as directory traversal, parallel processing with ThreadPoolExecutor, and logging setup. No signs of malicious code, such as network connections, data theft, or backdoors, are present. The focus is on legitimate file processing and documentation generation tasks. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are detected. The code does not handle sensitive data directly, nor does it perform unsafe operations like insecure SQL or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a typical documentation generator module with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a standard, benign utility for processing Python source files to generate documentation. No malware behaviors, such as data theft, system damage, or covert communications, are evident.",
