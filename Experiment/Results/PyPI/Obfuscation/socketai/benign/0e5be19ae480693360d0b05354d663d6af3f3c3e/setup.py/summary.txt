  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is present. The malware score is 0.0, obfuscation is moderate (around 0.6), and overall security risk is very low (~0.15). Caution is advised if further code or runtime behavior reveals more, but based on this static analysis, the package appears safe."
