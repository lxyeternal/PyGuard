  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata, classifiers, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines package metadata and CLI entry point.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; static configuration without dynamic or network operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration code without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and unusual string assignments; no comments or documentation explaining variables.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with superficial obfuscation via non-descriptive variable names. It performs static configuration tasks—reading a README file and setting package metadata, classifiers, and CLI entry points. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or user input handling is present. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not involve malicious code or behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The obfuscated variable names could be an attempt to conceal intent but do not, in this context, indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is present. The malware score is 0.0, obfuscation is moderate (around 0.6), and overall security risk is very low (~0.15). Caution is advised if further code or runtime behavior reveals more, but based on this static analysis, the package appears safe.",
