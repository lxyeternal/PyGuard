  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or external data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' is assigned to a variable; no flows leading to malicious sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup using setuptools. Reads a README file for description, defines package metadata, classifiers, and console script entry point. Variable names are intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or external communication observed. No suspicious patterns or malicious payloads found. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not relate to malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names that do not imply malicious intent. No malicious behavior or security risks detected.",
