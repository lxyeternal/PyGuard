  "purpose": "The code is designed to process Python files and generate Markdown documentation, with caching to optimize performance.",
  "sources": "File system reads for processing Python files, reading file contents for hashing, and writing documentation output.",
  "sinks": "Writing generated documentation to specified directories.",
  "flows": "Reading file content → generating documentation → writing output files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are apparent. The code uses caching for file hashes but nothing suggests malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment appears to be a standard implementation of a file processor with documentation generation. It utilizes caching for file hashes to avoid unnecessary reprocessing. No suspicious or malicious behaviors, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are detected. The code does not involve unsafe data handling, external connections, or obfuscated logic. All operations are related to file handling and documentation generation, which are typical for such tools.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate file processing and documentation generation tool with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided fragment. It appears to be well-structured for its intended purpose without any malicious anomalies.",
