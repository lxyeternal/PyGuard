  "purpose": "Documentation generator for Python AST nodes, functions, classes, and modules.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing functions, classes, and modules; file paths and content for generating documentation.",
  "sinks": "None identified; code primarily processes AST nodes and file content without external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Input source (AST nodes or file content) is processed internally to produce Markdown documentation; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Function 'SWOnbBFbnozDZEelmsAPQYXqChaakAJd' appears as a simple placeholder with no malicious code; class 'fZcPsohNRthHfLWPmZRwULGbBrYsoiei' is minimal with no suspicious methods. Variable and class names are nonsensical, possibly obfuscated, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for generating Markdown documentation from AST nodes, including methods for functions, classes, modules, and files. The variable names and class names are nonsensical and potentially obfuscated, but all methods seem to perform straightforward documentation generation tasks without any external data transfer or malicious operations. The placeholder function and empty class do not perform any harmful actions. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network communication, backdoors, or malicious code. The code appears to be a standard documentation tool with obfuscated naming but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a documentation generator with obfuscated identifiers but no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. It functions solely to parse AST nodes and produce documentation without any malicious side effects.",
