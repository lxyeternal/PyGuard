  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated symbolic math expression parser/evaluator with no active malicious behavior detected. The high obfuscation is likely for concealment, not malicious intent. The low malware score (0.0) is appropriate, with a moderate risk score (~0.2-0.3) due to potential injection if inputs are untrusted. Overall, the code does not pose an active security threat but warrants cautious use with untrusted inputs."
