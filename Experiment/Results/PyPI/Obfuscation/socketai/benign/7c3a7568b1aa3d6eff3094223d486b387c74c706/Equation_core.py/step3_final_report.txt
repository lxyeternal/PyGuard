{
  "purpose": "Heavily obfuscated symbolic expression parser and evaluator for mathematical expressions, supporting variables, functions, and operators.",
  "sources": "Input strings, regex patterns for numeric literals, class methods that process expression strings and variables.",
  "sinks": "Methods like __call__, __str__, __repr__, operator overloads, string formatting, and print statements.",
  "flows": "Input expression string -> regex parsing -> internal expression objects -> evaluation or string output.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and variable names, extensive use of reflection, dynamic method calls, and complex regex patterns for numeric literals.",
  "analysis": "The code implements classes for symbolic math, variable handling, and expression evaluation, heavily obfuscated but with no network, file, or system modification code. Regex patterns parse various numeric formats, and operator overloading supports symbolic computation. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation appears intended for concealment rather than malicious sabotage. Potential vulnerabilities could exist if untrusted input is fed directly into evaluation functions, but no such exploit is demonstrated. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the observed behavior, with malware scores near zero and high obfuscation scores justified by the code's structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated symbolic math expression parser/evaluator with no active malicious behavior detected. The high obfuscation is likely for concealment, not malicious intent. The low malware score (0.0) is appropriate, with a moderate risk score (~0.2-0.3) due to potential injection if inputs are untrusted. Overall, the code does not pose an active security threat but warrants cautious use with untrusted inputs.",
