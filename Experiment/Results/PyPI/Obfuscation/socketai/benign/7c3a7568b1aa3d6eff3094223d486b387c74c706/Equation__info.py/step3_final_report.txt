  "purpose": "Static package metadata including author info, license, version, and description.",
  "sources": "No external sources; static string and list assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is purely static.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical but do not perform any actions or conceal malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments containing metadata information. There are no functions, input handling, external data processing, or dynamic code execution. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The code serves as package metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation for malicious purposes, or security risks. The malware score is appropriately zero, the obfuscation score is low due to variable naming, and the security risk score is minimal. The code's benign nature is confirmed by all reports and aligns with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static metadata with no malicious intent or security risks. Variable obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious activity. All scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's content.",
