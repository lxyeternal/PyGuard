{
  "purpose": "Define metadata and author information for a Python package/module related to equation parsing and evaluation.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings and tuples containing contact info, license, version, and description; no external data input.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows or could cause data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all data are static strings or variables assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior detected. The code mainly contains static metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several variables containing contact info, license text, version, and description. The variables are assigned static strings and tuples with no dynamic execution, no external data reading, and no potentially dangerous functions. The '__all__' list exposes specific variable names, typical in Python modules. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or malicious behavior. The code appears to serve as metadata for a package, with no apparent security risks or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward metadata declaration with no malicious or suspicious elements. It does not perform any actions, data processing, or external communication. Therefore, it poses no security threat.",
