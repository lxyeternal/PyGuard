{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata and configuration variables for a Python package or module related to an equation parser and evaluator.",
  "sources": "The code reads static string and list data assigned directly to variables; no input sources, user data, or external data fetching is present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no data leaks, network operations, file writes, or execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; all data is statically assigned and used for metadata purposes only.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are present. All variables are assigned straightforward string or list literals.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments for package metadata, including authors, license info, version, and description. There are no dynamic code executions, external data interactions, or suspicious constructs. The variables are clearly named and hold static, benign information. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious intent. The code’s structure is simple and conventional for package metadata definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign metadata snippet for a Python package/module with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It contains static information used for package description and licensing, and no suspicious or malicious activities are present.",
