{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata and contact information for a Python package related to an equation parser and evaluator.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments containing strings and lists, including email addresses and license information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from variable assignments (sources) to module metadata; no processing or external data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly obfuscated or intentionally vague variable names; no actual malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets module-level metadata variables such as authors, license, contact info, version, title, and description. All data assigned are static strings or lists. No code execution, input handling, or external communications are present. Variable names are unconventional but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no evident security risks or malware indicators. The code appears to be straightforward module metadata definitions with no obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign module containing metadata about a Python package for an equation parser. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. The code structure is simple, and the variable naming seems obfuscated but harmless.",
