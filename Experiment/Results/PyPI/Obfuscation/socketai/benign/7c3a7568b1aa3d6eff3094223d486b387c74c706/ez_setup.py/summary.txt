  "conclusion": "The code exhibits characteristics typical of potentially malicious supply chain components, including obfuscation, remote code execution, and insecure download practices. While no direct malicious payloads are present, its capabilities could be exploited maliciously. The overall security risk is high, and it should be treated with caution."
