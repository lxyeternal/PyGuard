{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be the implementation of a Python package or script that may involve data processing or utility functions, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Data inputs are primarily read from environment variables, user input prompts, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, especially if the code executes commands with untrusted input or transmits data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network transmission, file storage, or system execution, possibly passing through intermediate processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No overt hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. However, any use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution should be carefully examined; such functions, if present, would indicate suspicious behavior. The code structure appears straightforward without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, checking for unusual code patterns, potential backdoors, or malicious logic. It reads data from standard sources and writes or transmits it potentially. No evidence of malicious payloads like data exfiltration, cryptomining, or system damage was found. The use of third-party libraries seems standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign based on the provided content. No malicious intent or malware indicators are observed. The security risk is minimal, with no significant threats identified. However, without full context or external dependencies, absolute certainty cannot be guaranteed.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
