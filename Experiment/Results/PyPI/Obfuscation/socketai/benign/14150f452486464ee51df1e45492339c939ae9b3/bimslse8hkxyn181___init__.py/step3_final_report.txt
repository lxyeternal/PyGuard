  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network sources, file operations, external modules.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, file I/O, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing functions, network requests, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious functions, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "All provided code snippets lack evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the absence of suspicious patterns. The risk score of 0.2 is a conservative estimate reflecting limited code context but no indicators of malicious intent. Confidence levels are high where thorough review was indicated. Given the limited data, the assessments are appropriate and cautious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score is justified given the lack of suspicious activity. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
