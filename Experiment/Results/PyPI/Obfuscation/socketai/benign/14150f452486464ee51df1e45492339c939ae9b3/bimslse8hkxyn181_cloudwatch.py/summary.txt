  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, heavily obfuscated AWS CloudWatch log handler. While obfuscation raises caution, there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior such as data theft, backdoors, or system damage. The malware score is low, and the security risk is moderate due to obfuscation but no active malicious indicators."
