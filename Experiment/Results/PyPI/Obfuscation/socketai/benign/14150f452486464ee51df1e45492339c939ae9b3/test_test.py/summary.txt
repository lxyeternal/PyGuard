  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malware or obfuscation but exhibits patterns (reinitializations, direct logging of file contents) that could be exploited for covert data transfer or leakage. The current security risk is moderate, and scores are appropriate. Vigilance is advised if used in sensitive environments, with validation of file contents and review of handler configurations."
