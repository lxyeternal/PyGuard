  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, API client for media services. No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise is present. The obfuscation warrants caution but is not sufficient to classify the package as malicious. Overall, the package is low risk with no malware detected."
