{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and utility methods for API request/response handling, primarily for constructing headers and parameters.",
  "sources": "Class attributes such as 'hl', 'gl', and other data fields used in header and request parameter construction.",
  "sinks": "Methods that generate dictionaries for HTTP headers and request parameters, which could be used in network requests.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes into header/dictionary creation functions, then potentially into network request functions outside this code.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names; reliance on external 'utils.filter' without implementation details; no network activity or code execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple data classes modeling API request/response data, with functions assembling headers and parameters. Obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious payloads, network activity, or system modifications are evident. The use of 'utils.filter' is a potential concern but cannot be evaluated without its implementation. Overall, the code appears to serve as a structured API client layer, with no direct indicators of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API data handling module with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. Obfuscation is notable but not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The low security risk score is appropriate, though continued review of external utilities and broader context is recommended.",
