{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define data structures and utility methods for handling API request parameters, headers, and response data, likely for a web service or API client.",
  "sources": "Reads data from class attributes and methods; no external input sources are explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "The methods prepare headers and request data which could potentially be used in HTTP requests; no explicit untrusted data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attributes through methods that generate headers or request parameters; no external untrusted data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, no explicit input validation, and complex class nesting could obscure malicious intent, but no clear malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines dataclasses with attributes that are used to format request headers and parameters for API calls, utilizing utility functions like 'filter'. There are no network calls, system modifications, or obfuscated payloads. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but the functions and data flows appear standard for API client setup. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are evident. The overall structure suggests an API interaction layer rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is consistent with a typical API client data structure setup with obfuscated variable names that may hinder readability but do not demonstrate malicious intent. No malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks are detected. The risk level is low, with no immediate security concerns identified.",
