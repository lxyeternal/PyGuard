  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API data handling module with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. Obfuscation is notable but not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The low security risk score is appropriate, though continued review of external utilities and broader context is recommended."
