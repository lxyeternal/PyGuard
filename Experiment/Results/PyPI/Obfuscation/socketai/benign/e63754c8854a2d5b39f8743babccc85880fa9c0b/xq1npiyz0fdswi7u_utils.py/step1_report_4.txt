  "purpose": "Filter a dictionary by including only items where the value is not None, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'dictionary' which is a dict.",
  "sinks": "Return statement constructs a new dictionary based on filtering; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'dictionary' -> filtering condition -> output dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and do not correspond to meaningful identifiers. The filtering logic is straightforward but obscured by nonsensical variable names.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a dictionary and returns a new dictionary containing only key-value pairs where the value is not None. The variable names (MingpVPmeCzaRnfsQWzWIgVzryVtWvgj and eQCNCPZeWZtgbwgTJXQDddNLFAZJwGlz) are intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide intent. The filtering operation itself is standard and does not involve external calls, network activity, or data leaks. No malicious code, such as system commands, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is present. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious behavior but warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple dictionary filter function with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues within this code fragment. The obfuscation may be intended to conceal its purpose but does not constitute malware or security risk.",
