  "purpose": "Define a Protocol interface with a method for network/API calls, serving as an abstract base.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code only declares an interface method.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow; method is unimplemented and raises NotImplementedError.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no implementation or executable logic; raises NotImplementedError.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structural interface with obfuscated identifiers, lacking any executable logic, data handling, or network activity. The obfuscation may be to hide intent but does not imply malicious behavior. The method is a placeholder, indicating this is meant for implementation elsewhere. No signs of malicious code, data leaks, or security risks are present. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware risk remains zero due to the absence of active malicious activity. The security risk score should be lowered to 0.0, reflecting the benign nature of this code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, obfuscated interface definition with no active malicious or security-threatening behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The code poses no security risk in its current form.",
