  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated data parsing module that processes API responses without executing harmful actions. Obfuscation is likely for proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities is present. The supply chain risk is low, but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring in future updates."
