{
  "purpose": "Define two custom exception classes, one of which holds a reference to a model object for string representation.",
  "sources": "Importing dataclasses and models module; reading class attributes, especially NUqjvgCcaBzQxUfILvxCbnTyPKZlhzXK in GXWjSCBvvAHjoeygBslyQulbIjVZyLHp",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method calls str() on an attribute that could potentially contain sensitive information, but no external sinks or network communication are present.",
  "flows": "Exception instantiation may involve setting NUqjvgCcaBzQxUfILvxCbnTyPKZlhzXK; calling str() on exception object triggers __str__, which accesses the attribute",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; no apparent functional purpose beyond exception definition; no hardcoded credentials or external calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exceptions with obfuscated names, with the first exception holding a reference to a model object and overriding __str__ to output this attribute. No data is read from untrusted sources, nor are there external data flows or network activity. The attribute might contain sensitive data, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated names could indicate an attempt to conceal intent, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign definition of custom exceptions with obfuscated names and no signs of malicious behavior. There are no data leaks, external communications, or malicious logic present.",
