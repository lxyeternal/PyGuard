{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes that may encapsulate or reference models from a local module.",
  "sources": "The import of the local module 'models', and the attribute 'NUqjvgCcaBzQxUfILvxCbnTyPKZlhzXK' within the class GXWjSCBvvAHjoeygBslyQulbIjVZyLHp.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method converting the attribute 'NUqjvgCcaBzQxUfILvxCbnTyPKZlhzXK' to string, which could be used if the exception is printed or logged.",
  "flows": "When the exception is raised and printed, the __str__ method accesses 'NUqjvgCcaBzQxUfILvxCbnTyPKZlhzXK' from the object, which could involve the 'models' module.",
  "anomalies": "The class names and attribute names appear obfuscated or auto-generated, which may suggest attempts at hiding purpose. The attribute 'NUqjvgCcaBzQxUfILvxCbnTyPKZlhzXK' may contain sensitive or important data from 'models', but it's not clear from the code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exceptions. The first exception class, GXWjSCBvvAHjoeygBslyQulbIjVZyLHp, contains a single attribute that references a model object, and its string representation returns this attribute. The second exception class is a simple placeholder with no additional logic. The import statement pulls in a 'models' module from the same package. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated class and attribute names could be suspicious, but they do not indicate malicious intent on their own. The use of an attribute from 'models' suggests possible data encapsulation or handling, but nothing malicious is implied. Overall, the code appears to be straightforward exception class definitions, with no evidence of malicious or security-risk behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a basic, possibly obfuscated, definition of custom exceptions that may hold or manipulate data from a local 'models' module. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security vulnerabilities present.",
