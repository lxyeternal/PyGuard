  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes that may include references to models for handling specific errors.",
  "sources": "Imports the models module, and accesses models.RHLaRsNXBlOFzFTknmjMucBlDhhFjIXa within the exception class.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; no data is written or transmitted externally, nor are untrusted inputs processed.",
  "flows": "The exception class accesses a potentially complex model attribute to generate a string representation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class and attribute names, which could be an attempt to hide functionality. No direct malicious code, but unusual naming patterns are suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes. The first class, GXWjSCBvvAHjoeygBslyQulbIjVZyLHp, stores a reference to a model attribute and returns its string representation. The class and attribute names are heavily obfuscated, which may indicate malicious intent or deliberate concealment. The second class is a simple placeholder exception. There is no apparent data flow leading to external systems or sensitive data handling. The use of models suggests integration with application data, but nothing explicitly malicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily defines obfuscated exception classes, with potential concealment via naming. No active malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system modification is detected. The main concern is the obfuscation, which warrants caution, but the code itself appears benign.",
