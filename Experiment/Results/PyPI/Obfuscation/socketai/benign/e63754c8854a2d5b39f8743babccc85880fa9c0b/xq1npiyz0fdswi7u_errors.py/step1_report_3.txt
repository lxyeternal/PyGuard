  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes that may encapsulate models from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code imports the 'models' module and accesses 'models.RHLaRsNXBlOFzFTknmjMucBlDhhFjIXa' within a class attribute.",
  "targets": "No direct untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observable in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The class 'GXWjSCBvvAHjoeygBslyQulbIjVZyLHp' stores a model object in an attribute with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name. The class name is also obfuscated, which is unusual. No actual malicious behavior is evident, but the obfuscation could be suspicious in some contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes: one that stores a model object from the 'models' module, and another that is a simple pass-through exception. The first class's attribute stores a model instance with a non-descriptive name, which may be used for obfuscation or concealment. The class names and attribute names are highly obfuscated, potentially to hide intent. However, there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a typical pattern for custom exceptions, albeit with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of obfuscated custom exception classes that do not show any overt malicious intent or security issues. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not directly imply malicious activity based on this fragment alone.",
