{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes, one referencing a model attribute, with heavily obfuscated class and attribute names.",
  "sources": "The class 'GXWjSCBvvAHjoeygBslyQulbIjVZyLHp' accesses 'models.RHLaRsNXBlOFzFTknmjMucBlDhhFjIXa' during string conversion.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network communication, or data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "The exception's __str__ method reads the model attribute and returns its string representation; no other data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and attribute names; no malicious code or suspicious patterns beyond naming concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes, with the first holding a reference to a model attribute and providing a string representation. No external communication, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation appears to be either auto-generated or intended to conceal intent but does not indicate malicious activity. The absence of data leaks, network activity, or malicious code suggests benign behavior. The obfuscation warrants caution but is not evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated exception class definition referencing a model attribute, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is notable but does not imply malicious intent. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
