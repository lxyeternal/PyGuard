  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The heavy obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Further investigation of the full codebase is recommended to determine if obfuscation is justified or malicious."
