  "purpose": "Assess the provided Python code snippet for potential malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and code flow anomalies.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules with heavily obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data flows, network operations, or data processing present; potential concern is obfuscation hiding malicious code elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Static import statements with obfuscated names; no runtime data flow or execution logic observable.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of import identifiers, which could be used to conceal malicious intent or sensitive logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with identifiers that appear heavily obfuscated or nonsensical. No executable logic, data handling, network activity, or other dynamic behaviors are present. The high obfuscation scores across reports reflect suspicion but are not definitive evidence of malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately low (0 to 0.1), indicating no direct malicious code detected. Risk scores are also low (around 0.2), consistent with the static nature of the code. The absence of active malicious behavior, combined with the possibility that obfuscation could be benign, suggests the code is likely safe but warrants further review of the entire codebase to rule out concealed malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The heavy obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Further investigation of the full codebase is recommended to determine if obfuscation is justified or malicious.",
