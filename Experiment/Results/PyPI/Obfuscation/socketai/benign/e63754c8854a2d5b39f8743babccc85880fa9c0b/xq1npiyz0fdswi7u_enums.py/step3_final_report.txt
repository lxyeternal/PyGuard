{
  "purpose": "Defines enum classes with string constants used as internal identifiers or configuration keys within an application.",
  "sources": "Static class attributes representing string constants; no external data input or dynamic sources.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static constants used internally without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns, secrets, or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum class definitions with string constants, serving as internal identifiers. Names are obfuscated, but there is no evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or external interactions. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for code organization or concealment, but does not imply malicious activity. No secrets, credentials, or network activity are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, high obfuscation) are justified given the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static, obfuscated enum definitions used internally within an application. There is no malware, malicious behavior, or security risk detected. The current assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
