{
  "purpose": "Define several enumeration classes for categorizing different string constants likely used as identifiers or labels in an application.",
  "sources": "Enumeration class definitions containing string constants, no external input reading.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling, external calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or unusual constructs. Enum classes are straightforward. No dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple enum classes inheriting from a base enum. Each class defines several string constants. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, or external dependencies. The naming appears obfuscated or auto-generated, but that alone is not suspicious. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code appears to be a standard static enumeration definition without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of enumeration definitions used to organize string constants. It poses no security risks or malicious behavior based on static analysis. There are no indicators of malware, data leaks, or sabotage.",
