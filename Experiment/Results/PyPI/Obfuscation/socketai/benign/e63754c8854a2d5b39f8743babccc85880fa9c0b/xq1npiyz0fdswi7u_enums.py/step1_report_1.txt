{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple enum classes used as constants for various application states or actions, possibly in a media or streaming service context.",
  "sources": "The code reads from hardcoded string values within enum class attributes.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network, file I/O, or system commands; the code primarily defines constants.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or user input processing are evident; the code only establishes static mappings.",
  "anomalies": "The class and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual. There are no functions, user input handling, or external interactions. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with string constants. Names appear obfuscated, but the content is static and harmless. No functions, external calls, or data processing occurs. The purpose seems to be for internal code referencing constants, with no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. Lack of dynamic execution, network activity, or data leakage points to benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated enum definitions used for constant identifiers. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscated naming does not contribute to malicious activity but suggests an attempt to hide the intent or reduce readability. Overall, it appears safe.",
