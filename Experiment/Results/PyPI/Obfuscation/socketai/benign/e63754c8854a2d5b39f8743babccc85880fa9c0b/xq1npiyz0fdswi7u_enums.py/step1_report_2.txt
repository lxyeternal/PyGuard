  "purpose": "Defines multiple enum classes with string constants representing different configuration and page identifiers for a media-related application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and string constant assignments",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted input or data flows",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code is static definitions only",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no backdoors, no unusual code behavior, and no dynamic execution or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code comprises several enum classes with string constants, likely used for application configuration or navigation identifiers. There is no user input, external data reading, or network activity present. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection, are observed. The structure appears to be straightforward and static, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving as static configuration or constants for an application. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
