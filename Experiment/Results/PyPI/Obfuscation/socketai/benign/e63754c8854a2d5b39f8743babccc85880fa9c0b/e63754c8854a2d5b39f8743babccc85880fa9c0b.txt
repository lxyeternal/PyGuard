The heavy obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Further investigation of the full codebase is recommended to determine if obfuscation is justified or malicious."

The obfuscation warrants caution but is not sufficient to classify the package as malicious. Overall, the package is low risk with no malware detected."

The primary concern is the insecure handling of API keys, which should be managed securely, but this does not indicate malware or active malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated data parsing module that processes API responses without executing harmful actions. Obfuscation is likely for proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. No evidence of malware or security vulnerabilities is present. The supply chain risk is low, but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring in future updates."

The obfuscation warrants caution, but no concrete malicious behavior is detected. The malware score should be low, reflecting suspicion due to obfuscation but absence of malicious payloads. The security risk remains moderate because obfuscation can conceal malicious intent, but current evidence is benign."
