{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads metadata and model files, then invokes setuptools.setup() with this data.",
  "sources": "Reads __file__ directory, README.md, VERSION file, and specific model files ('pos/model.crf', 'pos/postagger.model') if they exist.",
  "sinks": "Data passed to setuptools.setup(); no external sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Reads files from filesystem, verifies existence, and supplies data to setup() without dynamic code execution or external data transfer.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., WDWUnoNVehtiUftKgbArCfsesdfMArTL) intended to conceal intent; no malicious code or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup tasks: reading version info, optional README content, verifying model files, and calling setup(). No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation is the primary unusual aspect but does not impact security. The logic is straightforward and benign. No hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, obfuscated setup file with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. Scores should reflect zero malware likelihood, high obfuscation, and low security risk.",
