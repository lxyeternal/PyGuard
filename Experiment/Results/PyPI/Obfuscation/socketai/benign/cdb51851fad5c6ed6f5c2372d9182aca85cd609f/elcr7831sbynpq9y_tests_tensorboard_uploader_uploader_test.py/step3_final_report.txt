  "purpose": "Unit tests for the tensorboard uploader module, mocking cloud API interactions.",
  "sources": "Mocked functions and variables within test cases, such as tensorboard and aiplatform APIs.",
  "sinks": "No real external data or network activity; interactions are simulated via mocks.",
  "flows": "Test functions invoke uploader methods which call mocked APIs; no real data flow outside mocks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated mock variable names; no secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of structured unit tests with extensive mocking of cloud APIs. No actual data, network, or system modifications occur. Obfuscated variable names suggest autogenerated or stylistic naming but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The code's purpose is to test interactions with cloud services in a controlled environment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe test suite with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Obfuscation appears superficial and stylistic rather than malicious. The malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score around 0.7 due to naming style, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1).",
