  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, safe test suite with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. Obfuscation appears superficial and stylistic rather than malicious. The malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score around 0.7 due to naming style, and the overall security risk is very low (~0.1)."
