      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation is stylistic and does not pose a security risk. The overall security risk score remains very low, and malware likelihood is zero."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a translation utility with obfuscated naming. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration is detected. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the supply chain security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and process manipulation that could be exploited maliciously, such as killing critical processes or hiding server activities. While no direct malicious payloads are evident, the behaviors warrant caution. The overall malware suspicion score is moderate to high, and the security risk is elevated due to process control routines and obfuscation."

      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk behavior due to unsafe deserialization of external data via pickle.load() without validation, with obfuscated naming indicating potential malicious intent. The pattern is consistent with supply chain attacks or malicious payload execution. The overall security risk is high, and the malware score should be set accordingly."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate embedding and search utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The main concern is the obfuscation, which is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at approximately 0.6, and low security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated NLP tokenizer extension with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation and suppression of warnings are potential indicators of concealment but are not definitive. The current scores are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscation score approximately 0.75, and security risk score around 0.2, reflecting low suspicion but some caution due to obfuscation."

      "confidence": 0.65,
      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and complex, raising suspicion but lacking concrete malicious activity. It likely serves a legitimate purpose in feature extraction, but the obfuscation warrants caution. Further review of the full project context and static/dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm safety."

      "conclusion": "The code is limited to obfuscated imports with no active malicious behavior detected. Obfuscation warrants caution, but in the absence of further evidence, it is unlikely to be malicious. Further review of the actual module contents is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."

The high obfuscation warrants caution, but without evidence of malicious activity, the scores remain low for malware and moderate for risk. Further dynamic or source-level analysis of the 'text2text' module and the actual implementations of called methods is recommended to confirm benign intent."
