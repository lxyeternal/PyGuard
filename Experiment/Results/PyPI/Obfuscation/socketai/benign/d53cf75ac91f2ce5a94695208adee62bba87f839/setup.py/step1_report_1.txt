{
  "purpose": "This code defines the setup configuration for a Python package named 'text2text', including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' for long description; static strings for package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No dynamic data handling, user input, or untrusted data sources present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; the setup process is static and standard.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, but this appears to be a stylistic choice rather than malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads a README file and calls setuptools.setup with package metadata and dependencies. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hinder analysis, but no malicious or suspicious code is evident. The dependencies listed are common in NLP and machine learning projects. There are no code injection, malicious network calls, or hidden behaviors. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names, likely to deter casual inspection. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
