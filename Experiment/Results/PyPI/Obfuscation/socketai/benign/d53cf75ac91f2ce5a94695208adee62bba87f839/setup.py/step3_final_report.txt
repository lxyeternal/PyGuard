  "purpose": "Standard setup.py configuration script for packaging a Python project, defining metadata, dependencies, and package information.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; static metadata fields; dependencies list; no dynamic input or untrusted data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network calls, code execution, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Static data assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'zpplwbHLTSkaoDOyVtsAIqKYWNcPtZxt') which hinder analysis but are superficial; no malicious code or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names likely for stylistic or obfuscation purposes. It reads a README file and calls setuptools.setup() with package metadata, classifiers, keywords, and dependencies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. Dependencies are common in NLP/ML projects. The obfuscation does not impact functionality or security but complicates analysis. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are evident. The code is static and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation is stylistic and does not pose a security risk. The overall security risk score remains very low, and malware likelihood is zero.",
