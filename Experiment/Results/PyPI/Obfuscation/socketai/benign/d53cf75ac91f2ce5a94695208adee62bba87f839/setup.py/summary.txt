  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation is stylistic and does not pose a security risk. The overall security risk score remains very low, and malware likelihood is zero."
