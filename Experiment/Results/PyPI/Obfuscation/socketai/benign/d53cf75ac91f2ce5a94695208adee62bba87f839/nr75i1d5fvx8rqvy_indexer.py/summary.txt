  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate embedding and search utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The main concern is the obfuscation, which is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at approximately 0.6, and low security risk."
