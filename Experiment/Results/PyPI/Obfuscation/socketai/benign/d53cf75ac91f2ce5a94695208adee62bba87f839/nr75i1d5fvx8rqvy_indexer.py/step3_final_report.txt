  "purpose": "The code manages text embeddings, encodes documents, builds and manages a FAISS index for similarity search, and handles document retrieval based on embeddings.",
  "sources": "Input text data provided to encoding functions, internal data structures (list, DataFrame), and FAISS index for similarity search.",
  "sinks": "FAISS index for similarity search results, DataFrame for document metadata; no external network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input text -> encoding via encoders -> normalized embeddings -> added to FAISS index -> retrieval from FAISS index -> document metadata fetched from DataFrame.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names; no suspicious network activity, code injection, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a text embedding management system with indexing and retrieval capabilities. Obfuscated identifiers are present but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The code relies on well-known libraries and performs typical operations for document embedding and similarity search. The obfuscation could be superficial or auto-generated, but it does not imply malicious behavior. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is low, with the main concern being obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate embedding and search utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The main concern is the obfuscation, which is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation at approximately 0.6, and low security risk.",
