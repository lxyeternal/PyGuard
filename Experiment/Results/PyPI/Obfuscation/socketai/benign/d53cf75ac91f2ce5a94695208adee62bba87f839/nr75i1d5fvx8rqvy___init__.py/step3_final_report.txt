{
  "purpose": "This code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated module names, likely part of a larger package or internal module collection.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing modules with obfuscated names",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow present; only import statements",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated module names, which could be used to conceal malicious intent or proprietary code",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements with obfuscated module names, indicating potential concealment. No executable logic, data flows, or network activity are visible. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores reflect low malware likelihood (0.1), high obfuscation concern (0.9), and low security risk (0.2). Without further module content, definitive conclusions cannot be drawn, but the current evidence suggests a cautious approach.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to obfuscated imports with no active malicious behavior detected. Obfuscation warrants caution, but in the absence of further evidence, it is unlikely to be malicious. Further review of the actual module contents is recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
