  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, functioning as a translation utility with obfuscated naming. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration is detected. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the supply chain security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."
