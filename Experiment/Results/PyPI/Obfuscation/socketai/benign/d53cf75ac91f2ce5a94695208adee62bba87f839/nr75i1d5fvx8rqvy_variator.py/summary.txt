  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities based on static analysis of this fragment. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but without evidence of malicious activity, the scores remain low for malware and moderate for risk. Further dynamic or source-level analysis of the 'text2text' module and the actual implementations of called methods is recommended to confirm benign intent."
