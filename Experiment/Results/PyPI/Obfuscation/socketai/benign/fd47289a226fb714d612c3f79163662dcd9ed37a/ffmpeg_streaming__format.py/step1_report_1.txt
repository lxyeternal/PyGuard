{
  "purpose": "This code defines an abstract base class and multiple subclasses for configuring video and audio codecs with options, likely for a media processing application or library.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters (e.g., codec names, options) and class attributes. Static methods also accept parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code does not perform any operations that send data externally or write to files or network. No data leaks or untrusted data handling is apparent.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into class constructors and methods, used to set codec options. These options are returned as dictionaries. No further data flow or external system interaction is present.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, but no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation techniques are detected. No suspicious external calls or network activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines a hierarchy of classes for media codec configuration, with abstract methods and concrete implementations that return preset or customizable options. No external calls, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The class design appears legitimate for configuring codecs, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. No suspicious data flow, hidden backdoors, or malicious side effects are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a standard implementation of media codec configuration classes, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It seems to serve a legitimate purpose related to media processing.",
