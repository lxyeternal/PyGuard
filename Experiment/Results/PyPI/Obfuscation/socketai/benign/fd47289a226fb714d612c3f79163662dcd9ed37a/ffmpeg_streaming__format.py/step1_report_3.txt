  "purpose": "Define abstract and concrete classes for video codec configuration options with factory methods for different codecs.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, class attributes, and environment variables if used indirectly via external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous if any untrusted input reaches system calls or external libraries, but none are evident here.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through class constructors and method parameters to configuration dictionaries; no external untrusted sources or system calls are directly involved.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code or suspicious functions; some variable names are non-descriptive but not malicious. The only notable behavior is the factory pattern for creating codec configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class with required methods, and multiple subclasses implementing specific codecs. Factory methods return class instances with preset codec options. No user input validation beyond simple checks is performed, and no external network or file operations are present. The code does not include any system calls, network access, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Variable names are obfuscated but are consistent with their purpose. No malicious behavior or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup for video encoding codecs, utilizing factory methods for creating instances with preset options. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks present in this module.",
