  "purpose": "Define abstract and concrete classes for media encoding configurations, providing factory methods to instantiate specific codec settings.",
  "sources": "User-provided codec options via constructor parameters, class static methods that instantiate objects, and property methods returning configuration dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "Return values from property methods, and parameters passed to factory methods, which may be used in media processing pipelines.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into constructors and factory methods; property methods access instance variables; configuration dictionaries are returned and may be used downstream.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains obfuscated variable names, minimal documentation, and a lack of input validation beyond basic checks. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious domain connections are visible. The code appears to be a media configuration framework without malicious indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract base class for media codec configuration, with concrete subclasses for specific codecs (H264, H265, VP9). Each class initializes with codec parameters, either default or provided, and provides methods to generate configuration dictionaries. Factory methods in a separate class facilitate object creation. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code does not include any dynamic execution, external data fetching, or suspicious behaviors. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward media encoding configuration setup without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a media configuration framework with obfuscated variable names and no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It primarily sets up codec parameters for media processing, with safe static methods for object creation. No malware or security risks are evident from this analysis.",
