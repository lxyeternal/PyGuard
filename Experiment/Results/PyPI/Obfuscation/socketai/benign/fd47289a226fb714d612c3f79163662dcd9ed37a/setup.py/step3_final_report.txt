  "purpose": "Package setup script for 'python-ffmpeg-video-streaming', defining metadata and configuration for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file content into a variable; static strings for package metadata; URLs and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration with no data flow from external inputs.",
  "flows": "File read operation to variable assignment, then parameters passed to setuptools.setup() without dynamic or untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names with nonsensical identifiers; no dynamic code execution or network activity; purely static setup code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious. No network, credential, or injection activity is present. The obfuscation may be superficial or for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is correctly 0, as no malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7), reflecting the variable naming pattern. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with benign package configuration. Overall, the code appears legitimate, with obfuscation being the main concern but not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not increase security risk. The package can be considered safe, with obfuscation as the only notable aspect, which is not malicious in this context.",
