{
  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'python-ffmpeg-video-streaming' package, defining metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description; static string assignments for package metadata; use of setuptools functions to configure package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no data processing, external data transmission, or user input handling observed.",
  "flows": "Read README.md content -> Assign to variable (unused later); define package setup parameters with static values.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names are used throughout, which is unusual for standard setup scripts. No actual malicious behavior detected, but the variable naming pattern could be suspicious or an attempt to obfuscate intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script for packaging a project. It reads a README file, assigns metadata to variables with obfuscated names, and calls setuptools.setup() with static parameters. No external data input, no network activity, no credential handling, or malicious code present. The obfuscated variable names are atypical and could be a form of obfuscation or concealment, but they do not themselves indicate malicious intent. Overall, the script functions as intended for package configuration without evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not impact the security or functionality of the package setup.",
