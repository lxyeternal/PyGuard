{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for the Python package 'python-ffmpeg-video-streaming' including reading the README file and defining package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading from 'README.md' file, package setup parameters including hardcoded strings and URLs.",
  "sinks": "The setup function calls and parameter assignments could potentially introduce malicious data if manipulated, but they are standard for package setup.",
  "flows": "File content is read and stored in a variable, then used as a parameter in the setup() function, which then proceeds to package installation or distribution.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names and strings appear obfuscated or nonsensical (e.g., 'THtkPWerUfkDuwfYBnbAMAIOcLbXJbCt', 'vSRxnbjRIoUJojMKrQMbeoRoZPOHSMkE'), but these seem to be deliberately obfuscated labels rather than malicious code. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious network activities are present. The URLs and email are publicly available and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package, including reading a README file and specifying package metadata such as name, version, author, description, and URLs. Obfuscated variable names do not affect the execution but could be used to hide intent; however, no malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident. No code injection, data exfiltration, or harmful logic is detected. The use of standard libraries and functions appears benign. The obfuscation seems superficial and for naming complexity rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This is a typical setup.py file with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The package appears to be a legitimate media streaming utility without embedded malware or malicious behavior.",
