{
  "purpose": "This code is for configuring and setting up a Python package called 'python-ffmpeg-video-streaming' for distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'README.md' file as a source of input data.",
  "sinks": "The code writes package metadata into the setuptools.setup() function, which is not a sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' flows into a variable but is only used as package metadata; no untrusted data flows into other sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and inconsistent, suggesting potential obfuscation or malicious intent. The variable 'THtkPWerUfkDuwfYBnbAMAIOcLbXJbCt' is assigned the content of 'README.md' but is used as a package description, which is normal. However, the obfuscated variable names throughout the code are suspicious. There is no evidence of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup using setuptools, reading a README file for the long description. All parameters are typical for a Python package setup. The obfuscated variable names could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or obscure the code’s purpose, but in this context, they are simply unusual variable names. No malicious behavior or supply chain attack indicators are evident. The use of obfuscated variable names alone is not proof of malicious intent but warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package, with unusual variable naming that does not indicate malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks based on the provided code, but the obfuscation is suspicious and should be reviewed in a broader context.",
