  "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not increase security risk. The package can be considered safe, with obfuscation as the only notable aspect, which is not malicious in this context."
