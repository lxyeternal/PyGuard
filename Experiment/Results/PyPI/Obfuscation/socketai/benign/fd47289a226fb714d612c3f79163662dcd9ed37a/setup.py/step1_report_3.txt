  "anomalies": [

    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets present",
    "No use of eval, exec, or other dynamic code execution",

  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration for a Python package, reading a README file and passing metadata to setuptools.setup(). Although variable names are obfuscated, they do not contain malicious content or behavior. The code does not execute any external or untrusted data, nor does it perform network operations or system modifications. The use of obfuscated variable names may indicate attempts to obscure intent, but no malicious activity is evident. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate setup script with some obfuscation in variable naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup configuration script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent based on the provided code. It appears to be legitimate package setup code with no evidence of malicious intent.",
