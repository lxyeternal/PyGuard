{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a module related to streaming with ffmpeg, providing size and bitrate objects, possibly for handling or configuring streaming parameters.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources identified; the code mainly contains comments and metadata. No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No output sinks or data leaks are directly evident in this fragment; no untrusted data handling or output operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is identifiable in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains numerous @TODO comments without implementation, which is not inherently malicious but indicates incomplete documentation or development. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The snippet mainly consists of comments, licensing information, and placeholder TODOs. There are no functional code blocks, data processing, or network operations. The presence of @TODO comments alone does not suggest malicious intent. The code does not perform any input/output, data processing, or system modification. No anomalies such as obfuscated code, hidden behaviors, or malicious patterns are visible. The overall structure indicates an incomplete or in-progress module with no evidence of malicious or security-sensitive activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no indication of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code is primarily documentation and placeholder comments, with no operational logic present.",
