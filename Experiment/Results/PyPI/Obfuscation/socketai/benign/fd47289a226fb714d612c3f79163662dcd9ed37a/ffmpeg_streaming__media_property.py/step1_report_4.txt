{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package or module related to streaming, specifically handling size and bitrate objects, with metadata and placeholder comments indicating planned documentation.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or data; it mainly consists of comments and metadata.",
  "sinks": "There are no code operations or data processing that could lead to data leakage or security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable; the code contains only comments and metadata without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains multiple placeholder @TODO comments with no actual implementation, which may indicate incomplete code but no malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code, or obfuscated code is present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is primarily documentation comments and metadata. There are no functions, variables, or executable statements. It references copyright information, a website, an email, and licensing details. The @TODO comments suggest future work but do not contain code. There are no sources or sinks for untrusted data, no unusual code constructs, or suspicious behavior. The lack of actual logic or data handling indicates no malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of documentation comments and metadata placeholders. No malicious behavior, security threats, or anomalies are detected. The code appears incomplete or in the planning stage, but nothing suspicious is present.",
