  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the provided code snippet, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- The code snippet contains only comments, metadata, licensing info, and multiple @TODO placeholders.\n- No executable code, data sources, sinks, or data flows are present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious activity.\n- The repeated @TODO comments suggest incomplete documentation or development, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1 Analysis**\n\n- **Claim:** Non-executable documentation with no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis aligns well with the code. No issues found. The high confidence and zero scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2 Analysis**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar to Report 1, mainly documentation and placeholders.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. No concerns. The scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3 Analysis**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar, with no executable code, just placeholders.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.8\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, aligns with the code. Slightly lower confidence (0.8) is acceptable given the incomplete nature, but still reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4 Analysis**\n\n- **Claim:** Documentation and placeholders, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5 Analysis**\n\n- **Claim:** Similar to others, mainly comments and TODOs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with the code. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Evaluation**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Correctly zero; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk Score:** Zero across all reports, which is appropriate given the content.\n- **Confidence Scores:** Slight variations are reasonable based on completeness, but all are high, reflecting certainty that there's no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations**\n\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the code content.\n- No adjustments needed; all assessments are justified.\n- The overall malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores should remain at **0**.\n- The confidence scores are appropriate, given the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\n\n**Estimated scores based on the code snippet:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code contains only comments, metadata, and placeholders with no executable or suspicious content. The reports' assessments are accurate and justified.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:**  \nIt's important to monitor future code additions for actual implementation, but based on this snippet, there are no security concerns.",
