  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as primarily comments, metadata, and placeholders with no executable logic.\n- No input/output operations, data processing, or system modifications are present.\n- No suspicious code patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n- The presence of multiple @TODO comments indicates incomplete implementation, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Presence of malicious code:** None of the reports find any actual code that could be malicious. The code is just documentation placeholders.\n- **Obfuscation:** All reports agree that the code is not obfuscated.\n- **Security risks:** No security risks are identified, as there's no executable or data handling code.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Scores and reasoning:\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, which is reasonable given the code is plain comments and placeholders.\n- **Malware score:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk score:** All are 0, appropriate given the code's nature.\n- **Confidence levels:** Ranging from 0.8 to 1, reflecting high certainty that there's no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n\n- The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly identifying the code as benign documentation.\n- No assumptions about vulnerabilities are made; the analysis is based solely on the provided code snippet.\n- The repeated @TODO comments are typical in incomplete or developing codebases and do not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\nGiven the nature of the code (comments and placeholders), the scores assigned are appropriate. There is no evidence to suggest malware, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, consisting solely of documentation and placeholders. The scores in the reports are justified and should remain as is.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the overall assessment confirms that this code snippet poses no security threat.",
