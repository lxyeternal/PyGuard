  "purpose": "The code snippet contains only comments, metadata, and placeholder @TODOs, with no executable logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "No data sources; the code is purely comments and placeholders.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of repetitive @TODO comments and metadata with no actual implementation or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is non-executable, consisting solely of documentation comments and placeholders. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are detected. The absence of data handling, network activity, or code logic indicates no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Confidence in this assessment is high (close to 1), given the clear lack of executable content.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is purely documentation and placeholders with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores accurately reflect its benign state, and no modifications are necessary.",
