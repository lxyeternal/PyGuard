  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python module related to FFmpeg streaming, possibly defining size and bitrate objects for streaming configurations.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources are present in the provided fragment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are identifiable from this fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple @TODO comments suggests incomplete implementation; no suspicious or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a copyright notice, contact information, license details, and multiple placeholder comments indicating future additions. There is no executable code, data handling, or logic present. The lack of actual implementation makes it impossible for this fragment alone to perform any malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are evident. The placeholders indicate ongoing development rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be an incomplete or template segment for documenting or developing FFmpeg streaming configurations. No malicious or suspicious activity is detected.",
