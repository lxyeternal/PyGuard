  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of malicious code or malware:**\n   - All reports correctly identify that the provided snippet contains only comments, metadata, and placeholder @TODOs, with no executable code, data processing, or logic.\n   - There are no signs of obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behavior in the code itself.\n   - The malware score is consistently 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n   - The reports are thorough and consistent, correctly noting the lack of code, data sources, sinks, and flows.\n   - They appropriately interpret the placeholder nature of the code as incomplete documentation rather than malicious or vulnerable code.\n   - No significant logical flaws or misinterpretations are evident in the analysis.\n\n3. **Scores and their reasonableness:**\n   - All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n   - The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the lack of executable code or data handling.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), reflecting certainty that the code is benign.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since there is no executable code, no data flow, and no suspicious activity, raising the risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - The reports appropriately keep the risk at 0, aligning with the evidence.\n\n5. **Claims based on assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they interpret the code as incomplete documentation.\n   - No speculative vulnerabilities are claimed.\n\n6. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - The scores are consistent and justified given the nature of the code snippet.\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code snippet is purely documentation and placeholders, with no malicious or security-related issues.\n- The malware, obfuscated, and risk scores should remain at 0.\n- The confidence levels are appropriate, given the clear absence of executable or sensitive code.\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- The current scores and analysis are accurate and appropriate.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis reflects the benign, non-executable, placeholder nature of the code snippet.",
