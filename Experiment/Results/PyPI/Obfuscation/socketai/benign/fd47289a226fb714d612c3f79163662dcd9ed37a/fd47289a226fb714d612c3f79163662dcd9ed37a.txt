      "conclusion": "The script is a benign package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not increase security risk. The package can be considered safe, with obfuscation as the only notable aspect, which is not malicious in this context."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a media playlist utility with obfuscated naming, lacking any evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low malware score (0) is appropriate; obfuscation is high but not indicative of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, primarily influenced by obfuscation concerns rather than active threats."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a multi-cloud storage utility with significant obfuscation. There are no explicit signs of malicious payloads or sabotage. The obfuscation and inconsistent logging are suspicious and warrant cautious review, but based solely on this code, the likelihood of malicious intent is low. The overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation, but no active malicious behavior is evident."

The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent, and the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose within media processing pipelines."

The low malware score (0.2) is appropriate given the lack of evidence for malicious intent. The high obfuscation score (around 0.75) reflects the naming and import patterns. Overall security risk remains low (around 0.2), but obfuscation warrants further review in the broader context."

Its obfuscation and dynamic behavior could potentially be exploited if misused, so it should be reviewed carefully before deployment in security-sensitive contexts."

The obfuscation and incomplete functions raise suspicion but do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), justified by the naming conventions. Overall, the code appears benign, primarily utility functions with obfuscation."
