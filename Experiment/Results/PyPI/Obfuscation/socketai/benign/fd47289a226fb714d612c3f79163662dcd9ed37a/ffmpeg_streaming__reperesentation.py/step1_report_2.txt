{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle media size, bitrate, and format configurations, likely for media processing or streaming.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input parameters such as size, bitrate, and format objects, as well as list inputs for heights and bitrates.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks indicating malicious data leakage or external communication are present. No system commands or network operations are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters into class attributes, and functions process and modify bitrate and size data. No external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, and there are several instances of unclear or placeholder-like variable names, which may indicate obfuscation. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. No external data or command execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages media properties through classes and functions for adjusting bitrate and size based on input parameters. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system compromise, or backdoors. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be for benign reasons or to hide intent, but no malicious actions are explicitly present. The code does not perform network operations, file manipulations, or system commands. It performs calculations related to media size and bitrate adjustments. The structure suggests it's part of a media processing pipeline rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a media handling library with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, malware, or security vulnerabilities are evident based on the provided code.",
