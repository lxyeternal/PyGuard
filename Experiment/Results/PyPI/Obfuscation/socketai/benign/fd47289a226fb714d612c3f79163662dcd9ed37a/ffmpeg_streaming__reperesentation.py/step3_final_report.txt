{
  "purpose": "The code manages media size, bitrate adjustments, and generates scaled media representations, primarily for media processing tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input from class constructors (size, bitrate, format), internal functions accessing object attributes, and size/bitrate lists.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks such as network, file I/O, or system commands; calculations are internal.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through functions that calculate adjusted bitrates and sizes, ultimately used in media representation classes.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, but no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard media size and bitrate calculations, including resizing and generating multiple resolution representations. Variable names are obfuscated, which could be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. No external data flows, network activity, or system modifications are present. The functions validate inputs and perform calculations consistent with media processing utilities. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system actions are evident. The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate media processing utility with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming, but overall, the code is benign.",
