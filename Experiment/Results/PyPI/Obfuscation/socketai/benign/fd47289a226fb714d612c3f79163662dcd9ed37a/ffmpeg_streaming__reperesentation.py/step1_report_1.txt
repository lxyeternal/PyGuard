{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle media format, size, bitrate management, and generate different size and bitrate representations for media processing or streaming.",
  "sources": "Data is read from function parameters, class attributes, and imported modules (_format, _media_property). No external untrusted input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Data is used internally for calculations; no sinks like network connections, file writes, or system commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input data (size, bitrate, format, height list) flows through functions and classes to generate scaled sizes and bitrates, with no external or untrusted data interaction.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features. Variable and class names are non-descriptive but consistent. No suspicious network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines media size and bitrate handling classes, with functions for adjusting bitrate and creating scaled media representations based on input sizes and format ratios. Class constructor checks ensure consistent data length. The flow is straightforward, involving calculations for height and width adjustments and encapsulating media representation objects. There is no evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malicious behavior. The code's structure and content appear normal for media processing purposes, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard media handling utility with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It performs calculations related to media size and bitrate scaling without any suspicious activity.",
