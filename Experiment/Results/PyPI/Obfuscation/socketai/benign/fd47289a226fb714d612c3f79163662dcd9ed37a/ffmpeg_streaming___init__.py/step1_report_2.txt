{
  "purpose": "The code is aggregating and exporting symbols from multiple internal modules for external use, likely forming part of a larger Python package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: _input, _format, _reperesentation, _media_property, _clouds, ffprobe",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports modules and combines their __all__ lists without processing untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Unusual: The module '_reperesentation' appears to be a misspelling of '_representation', which may indicate a typo or an unconventional naming choice; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports various internal modules and combines their __all__ lists for export, typical in Python packages. The naming inconsistency ('_reperesentation') is unusual but not malicious. The code contains no data processing, input reading, or output operations. No suspicious behaviors, such as malicious code injection or backdoors, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module aggregator with a possible typographical anomaly in module naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
