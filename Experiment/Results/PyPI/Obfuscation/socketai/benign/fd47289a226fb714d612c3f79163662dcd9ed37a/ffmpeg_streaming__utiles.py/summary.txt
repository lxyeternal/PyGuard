  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated utility functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation and incomplete functions raise suspicion but do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), justified by the naming conventions. Overall, the code appears benign, primarily utility functions with obfuscation."
