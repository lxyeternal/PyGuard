  "purpose": "Utility functions for filesystem operations and string path manipulations, likely used for directory creation, deletion, and path processing.",
  "sources": "os module functions (os.makedirs, os.remove, os.path.basename), input parameters for functions",
  "sinks": "os.makedirs, os.remove, string methods (replace, rsplit), exception handling (logging)",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into filesystem and string functions; no external untrusted data flows detected",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, incomplete functions, use of non-standard logging function (`DTOZWTCbReoKaBRUzRRrytIQMZMKNIKC`), undefined variable `arg` in one function",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for creating directories, deleting files, and processing path strings. Obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to conceal intent, but no network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The exception handling calls a non-standard logging method, which may be a typo or obfuscation. One function references an undefined variable `arg`, indicating incomplete or broken code. Overall, the functions are benign, performing filesystem and string operations, with obfuscation but no malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated utility functions with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation and incomplete functions raise suspicion but do not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), justified by the naming conventions. Overall, the code appears benign, primarily utility functions with obfuscation.",
