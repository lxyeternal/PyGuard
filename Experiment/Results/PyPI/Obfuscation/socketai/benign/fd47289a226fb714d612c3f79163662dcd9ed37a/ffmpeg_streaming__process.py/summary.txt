  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated media processing utility rather than malicious software. The low malware score (0.2) is appropriate given the lack of evidence for malicious intent. The high obfuscation score (around 0.75) reflects the naming and import patterns. Overall security risk remains low (around 0.2), but obfuscation warrants further review in the broader context."
