{
  "purpose": "The code manages subprocess execution for ffmpeg commands, with monitoring, timeout, and process control features. It appears to be a media processing utility with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "Command input parameters, environment variables, process stdout and stderr streams, dynamic attribute access (e.g., 'key_rotation').",
  "sinks": "Process stdout output, logs, potential data in logs or output streams, process termination signals.",
  "flows": "Input commands are executed via subprocess; stdout and stderr are read; dynamic attributes may influence process behavior; monitor functions receive output data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module imports ('_hls_helper', '_utiles'), ambiguous class and function names, dynamic attribute access to 'key_rotation', unusual import patterns, non-descriptive identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code is a subprocess wrapper for ffmpeg with monitoring and timeout features. Obfuscated naming and dynamic attribute access suggest an attempt to conceal functionality but do not indicate malicious activity. No network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification evidence is present. The process management and output reading are standard. Obfuscation and unusual imports are suspicious but not conclusive of malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated media processing utility rather than malicious software. The low malware score (0.2) is appropriate given the lack of evidence for malicious intent. The high obfuscation score (around 0.75) reflects the naming and import patterns. Overall security risk remains low (around 0.2), but obfuscation warrants further review in the broader context.",
