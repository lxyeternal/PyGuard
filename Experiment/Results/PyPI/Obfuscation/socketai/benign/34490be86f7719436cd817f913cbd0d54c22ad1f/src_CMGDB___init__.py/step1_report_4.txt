  "purpose": "Import modules related to CMGDB, likely for computational or visualization tasks involving Morse graphs and sets.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the CMGDB package, importing various modules.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements, no data flow or execution logic shown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected; only module imports.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of import statements from a package named CMGDB. These imports suggest usage of various functionalities such as plotting, loading, computing, and saving Morse sets and box maps. There is no executable code, data processing, or network activity shown that could indicate malicious behavior. The structure is straightforward and typical for a Python project setup.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be standard import statements for a scientific or mathematical package, with no malicious intent.",
