  "purpose": "Import modules from the CMGDB package for computational and plotting tasks related to Morse graphs and sets.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load modules from the CMGDB package",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; only module imports are shown",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior; all imports are from a presumably legitimate package",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the CMGDB package. There are no functions, data processing, or network activities present. The imported modules appear related to data analysis, visualization, and file operations. No hardcoded credentials, malicious commands, or suspicious code patterns are observed. The code's simplicity and legitimate-looking imports indicate a standard setup routine.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward import of modules from a known package related to Morse graph analysis. It contains no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
