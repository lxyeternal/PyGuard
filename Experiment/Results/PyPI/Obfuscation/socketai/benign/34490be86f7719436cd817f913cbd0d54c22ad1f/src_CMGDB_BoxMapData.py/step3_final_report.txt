  "purpose": "A spatial data handler class performing boundary checks, interpolation, and padding operations on input coordinate arrays.",
  "sources": "Input arrays provided to methods, class attributes such as sxJCVGpzTmIGfCiVLpHruFdchvjJgiMW and WsGdVQahdpGpEJzYPztlsQPssQTbNSAs.",
  "sinks": "Internal data processing with no external communication, network, or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through boundary checks, padding adjustments, and interpolation functions, ultimately returning processed coordinate data.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, complex control flow, and no external malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a complex spatial data processing utility with boundary handling, interpolation, and padding features. Despite high obfuscation, no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or destructive operations is present. The obfuscation likely serves to conceal complexity or proprietary logic but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated but benign spatial data handler. No malicious activity or malware is evident. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming and control flow complexity, but overall security risk remains low due to the absence of malicious operations.",
