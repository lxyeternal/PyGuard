{
  "purpose": "Generate a visual graph representation from a graph object using matplotlib and graphviz libraries.",
  "sources": "Vertices and adjacency data from the input graph object, color and style parameters, normalization functions.",
  "sinks": "Graphviz source generation, visualization output; no network, file, or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Vertices and adjacency data are processed to produce a DOT language string, which is then visualized via graphviz.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names and nested functions; no malicious code or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a DOT graph representation with styling options, relying solely on the input graph's vertices and adjacencies. Obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to conceal complexity but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The visualization process is standard, and no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign graph visualization utility with obfuscation but no malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score remains at 0, and the low risk score (~0.2-0.3) is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity. Obfuscation is moderate and warrants a slightly elevated obfuscated score (~0.4). Overall, the code appears safe, with no supply chain or malicious concerns.",
