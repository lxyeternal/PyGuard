  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign graph visualization utility with obfuscation but no malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score remains at 0, and the low risk score (~0.2-0.3) is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity. Obfuscation is moderate and warrants a slightly elevated obfuscated score (~0.4). Overall, the code appears safe, with no supply chain or malicious concerns."
