  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific visualization utility for Morse graph data. It contains obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The high obfuscation score is justified, and malware risk is effectively zero. Overall, it is a benign visualization tool with minimal security concern."
