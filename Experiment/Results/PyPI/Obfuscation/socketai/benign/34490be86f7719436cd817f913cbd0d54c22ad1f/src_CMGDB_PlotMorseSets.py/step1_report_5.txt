{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate a complex plot based on data structures related to Morse sets, potentially for visualization of mathematical or dynamical systems data.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input parameters, including data structures that may contain Morse set information, and environment variables such as figure filenames for saving outputs.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs plots using matplotlib, potentially saving figures to disk if a filename is provided. No network transmission, data exfiltration, or command execution is evident.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed to produce visualizations; data flows from input parameters through computations to plotting and optional file saving.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code, are present. The code performs complex plotting logic with many parameters, but this is typical for visualization functions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that perform data visualization using matplotlib. The primary function processes data related to Morse sets, extracting coordinates, normalizing color maps, and plotting scatter plots. The data handling appears domain-specific, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, file tampering, or code injection. The use of assert statements and parameter checks ensures input validation. The code is complex but structurally straightforward and appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to data visualization. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a visualization utility for plotting Morse set data. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware. The complexity stems from domain-specific data processing rather than malicious intent. No security risks or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
