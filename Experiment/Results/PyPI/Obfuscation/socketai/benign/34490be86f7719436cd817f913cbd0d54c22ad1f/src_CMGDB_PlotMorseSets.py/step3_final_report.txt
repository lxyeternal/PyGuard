{
  "purpose": "The code provides visualization of Morse graph data, generating plots with configurable axes, labels, and optional figure saving. It handles input validation and processes data for plotting.",
  "sources": "Reads Morse graph objects or strings, and data from parameters for plotting; accesses external libraries for visualization.",
  "sinks": "Produces matplotlib plots; saves figures if specified; no network or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and Morse graph structures through validation, processing, and into plotting functions to generate visualizations.",
  "anomalies": "Uses heavily obfuscated variable names, but no suspicious external calls, hardcoded secrets, or hidden code detected. Assertions and validation are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code validates input types, processes Morse graph data or strings, performs dimension checks, and generates plots with matplotlib. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. Obfuscation appears to be solely due to variable naming, not malicious intent. The code is domain-specific for visualization purposes and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, domain-specific visualization utility for Morse graph data. It contains obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The high obfuscation score is justified, and malware risk is effectively zero. Overall, it is a benign visualization tool with minimal security concern.",
