      "conclusion": "The code is a geometric or sampling utility with heavy obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the logic itself does not suggest malicious behavior. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

The malware score remains at 0, and the low risk score (~0.2-0.3) is appropriate given the lack of malicious activity. Obfuscation is moderate and warrants a slightly elevated obfuscated score (~0.4). Overall, the code appears safe, with no supply chain or malicious concerns."

It contains obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The high obfuscation score is justified, and malware risk is effectively zero. Overall, it is a benign visualization tool with minimal security concern."
