  "conclusion": "The code is a geometric or sampling utility with heavy obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the logic itself does not suggest malicious behavior. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
