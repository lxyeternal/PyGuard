  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build setup script with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate; obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for standard build processes."
