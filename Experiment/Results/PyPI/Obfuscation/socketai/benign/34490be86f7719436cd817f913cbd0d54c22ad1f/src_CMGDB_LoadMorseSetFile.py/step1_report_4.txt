  "purpose": "The function reads numerical data from a CSV file and stores it in a list.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a CSV file specified by filename parameter",
  "sinks": "Data read from CSV is stored in a list; no direct sinks for untrusted data execution or leakage are present",
  "flows": "Input filename -> open file -> csv.reader -> iterate over rows -> append data to list -> return list",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated function and variable names; no apparent suspicious code or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that opens a CSV file in read mode, then uses csv.reader with quoting set to QUOTE_NONNUMERIC to read numerical data, skipping initial space. Data from each row is appended to a list which is returned. Variable names are obfuscated, but the operations are standard CSV reading procedures. There are no hardcoded credentials, external network calls, or suspicious data handling. The function solely reads numeric data and returns it, with no evident malicious intent or behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a benign utility function for reading numerical data from a CSV file. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident based on the provided code.",
