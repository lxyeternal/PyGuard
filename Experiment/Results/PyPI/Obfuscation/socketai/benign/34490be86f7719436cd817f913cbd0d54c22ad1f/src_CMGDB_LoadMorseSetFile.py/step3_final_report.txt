  "purpose": "Reads numeric data from a CSV file into a list of lists.",
  "sources": "File opened in read mode, csv.reader reading data with quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC, skipinitialspace=True.",
  "sinks": "Appends each row of numeric data to a list, returns the list.",
  "flows": "File input -> csv.reader -> append rows -> return list.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; no malicious code or network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CSV data loader that reads numeric data into a list. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. Obfuscated variable names could be suspicious but do not confirm malicious intent. The logic is simple and benign, with no security vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns. Malware score is correctly set to 0; obfuscation is notable but not malicious; security risk is low (~0.2). The code's purpose aligns with benign data loading, and the obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CSV loader with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present. Obfuscation is a red flag but not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. Scores should reflect high confidence in benign purpose, with a moderate obfuscation score and low security risk.",
