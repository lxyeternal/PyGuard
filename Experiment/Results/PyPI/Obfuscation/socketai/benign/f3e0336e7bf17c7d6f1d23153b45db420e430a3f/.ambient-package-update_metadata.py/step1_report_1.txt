  "purpose": "Define and organize metadata for the Python package 'django-dynamic-admin-forms'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for package components and constants, and the instantiation of the PackageMetadata object with package details.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input or data; static assignment of package metadata.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported constants and classes into the PackageMetadata object; no user input or external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious patterns detected. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports package-specific classes and constants, then constructs a static PackageMetadata object with hardcoded and imported data. No dynamic execution, external inputs, or untrusted data sources are present. The dependencies and metadata are standard for package configuration and documentation purposes. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, static definition of package metadata with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to serve the purpose of describing package information for distribution without any suspicious activity.",
