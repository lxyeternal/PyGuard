  "purpose": "Define and organize metadata for the Python package 'django-dynamic-admin-forms'.",
  "sources": "Reading package metadata attributes, including authors, dependencies, and configuration constants.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to critical functions; mainly static configuration assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behavior detected. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external data fetching present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily constructs a metadata object with package information such as authors, dependencies, and configuration details. All data appears static, hardcoded, or imported constants. No external input handling or untrusted data sources are evident. The code does not include network operations, file manipulations, or security-sensitive functions. The use of constants and explicit string assignments indicates a standard package metadata setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward static configuration of package metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. It appears safe and intended for package setup purposes.",
