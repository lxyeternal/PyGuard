  "purpose": "Define and organize metadata for the Python package 'django-dynamic-admin-forms'.",
  "sources": "Imports from ambient_package_update.metadata modules, constants, and lists used in dependencies and optional dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to untrusted data processing or external effects; primarily static data definitions.",
  "flows": "Import statements → Metadata object creation → Usage of constants and lists in defining dependencies and other metadata.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and constants, then creates a structured PackageMetadata object with predefined data, including author info, dependencies, and metadata tags. The dependencies and optional dependencies are derived from constants, suggesting configuration flexibility. No external inputs, user data, or untrusted sources are processed. There are no dynamic code executions, obfuscated code segments, or suspicious patterns. The code is straightforward, serving as a static data definition for package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical metadata configuration script defining package information. It does not contain malicious behavior, hidden backdoors, or malicious data leakage mechanisms. It appears safe and intended solely for package metadata organization.",
