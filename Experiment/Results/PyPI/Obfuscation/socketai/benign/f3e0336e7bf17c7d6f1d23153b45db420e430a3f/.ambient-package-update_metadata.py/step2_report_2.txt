  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports consistently identify the code as static, straightforward package metadata configuration.\n- No dynamic data, user input, or external data sources are involved.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.\n- No network activity, code execution, or data leakage mechanisms are present.\n- The dependencies and author information are standard and explicitly defined.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The code imports constants and classes from the package's own modules and constructs a `PackageMetadata` object with static data.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or unusual logic are detected.\n- The scores assigned by the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with the analysis.\n\n**Assessment of individual scores:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, matching the straightforward nature of the code.\n- The security risk score is 0, as there are no vulnerabilities or risky operations.\n\n**Potential concerns or assumptions:**\n- All reports are consistent and reasonable in their assessments.\n- No evidence suggests any malicious intent or security vulnerability.\n- The only slight point to consider is the inclusion of author and maintainer info, but this is standard and not suspicious.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n- The scores seem appropriate and justified.\n- No adjustments needed based on the provided information.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, static code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a typical static package metadata definition with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. The scores assigned by the reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe.\n- No malicious or obfuscated activity present.\n- The risk level is minimal.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or further analysis.",
