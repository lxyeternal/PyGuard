  "review": "Let's systematically evaluate each report and the associated code to ensure accuracy and consistency.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as static, straightforward package metadata setup.\n- No dynamic code, external data input, or user interaction is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are identified.\n- All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which aligns with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Code correctness:** The code is syntactically correct, imports necessary modules, and constructs a `PackageMetadata` object with static data.\n- **Presence of issues:** No issues, vulnerabilities, or malicious patterns are detected.\n- **Flow and sinks:** Data flows are static, from constants and hardcoded strings into the metadata object. No external or untrusted data sources.\n- **Anomalies:** None identified—no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious code.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity or intent)\n- **Security risk:** 0 (no vulnerabilities or risky behaviors)\n\nAll reports are consistent in their assessments and scoring.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- **Are any issues present?**  \n  No, the code is purely static configuration data with no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n- **Are the reasoning and conclusions sound?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify the code as safe and straightforward.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Yes, the malware and security risk scores are appropriately zero.\n\n- **Any assumptions challenged?**  \n  The reports do not assume any malicious intent beyond static data; this is correct.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimation:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I concur with the provided scores and assessments. The code is a typical package metadata definition with no security concerns.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThese align with the current reports and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a straightforward, static package metadata configuration with no malicious, obfuscated, or security risk elements. All reports are accurate and consistent.",
