  "purpose": "Static declaration of package metadata including authors, maintainers, dependencies, and configuration details for the 'django-dynamic-admin-forms' package.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from internal modules (SUPPORTED_DJANGO_VERSIONS, SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS), hardcoded strings, and class constructors with static data.",
  "sinks": "None; data flows from static imports and hardcoded values into the PackageMetadata object without external or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Import statements -> static data assignment -> PackageMetadata constructor with static parameters.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and contains no obfuscated or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports constants and classes, then constructs a PackageMetadata object with static, predefined data. No dynamic input, network activity, or obfuscated code is present. The data includes author info, maintainer info, dependencies, and configuration flags, all hardcoded or imported from internal modules. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate given the static and metadata-only nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static package metadata configuration with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the code's content.",
