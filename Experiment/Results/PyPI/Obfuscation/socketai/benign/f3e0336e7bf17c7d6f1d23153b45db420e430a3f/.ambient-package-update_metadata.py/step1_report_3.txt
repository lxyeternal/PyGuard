  "purpose": "Define and organize metadata for the Python package 'django-dynamic-admin-forms' including authors, maintainers, dependencies, and other package details.",
  "sources": "Import statements for package components; attribute values within PackageMetadata and associated classes.",
  "sinks": "None identified. No untrusted data sources or insecure data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "Initialization of PackageMetadata object with static strings and constants; no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be straightforward metadata configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific package components and defines a metadata object with static, hardcoded information. The dependencies and authors are explicitly specified with no dynamic input. No potentially malicious behaviors such as network activity, credential handling, or code execution are detected. The structure is typical for package setup or metadata configuration. The only notable aspect is the inclusion of developer and author info, which is standard and not suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard metadata configuration for a Python package with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any data processing, external communication, or sensitive operations. The security risk is minimal, and there are no anomalies or obfuscation detected.",
