  "purpose": "Define and store metadata information about the Python package 'django-dynamic-admin-forms'.",
  "sources": "Imported modules from 'ambient_package_update.metadata' and data from 'SUPPORTED_DJANGO_VERSIONS', 'SUPPORTED_PYTHON_VERSIONS', 'DEV_DEPENDENCIES'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or outputs; no data processing, network communication, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "The code initializes a PackageMetadata object with static data from constants and imported modules, without any dynamic or untrusted input flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic observed. The code consists of straightforward data structure initialization.",
  "analysis": "The script imports static metadata components and constructs a PackageMetadata object with predefined values, including author info, license, dependencies, and other package details. No dynamic execution, user input, or external data handling is present. The data appears standard for package configuration, with no anomalies or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package metadata declaration without any malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks. It primarily defines static package info for distribution.",
