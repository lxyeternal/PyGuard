  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django component for dynamic form and model handling, with no evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors. The primary security concern is the lack of input validation on user-supplied parameters used for model and method retrieval, which could be exploited if an attacker supplies malicious input. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation is moderate. The security risk score should be elevated to reflect the potential for injection or misuse due to unvalidated dynamic method calls, estimated around 0.5."
