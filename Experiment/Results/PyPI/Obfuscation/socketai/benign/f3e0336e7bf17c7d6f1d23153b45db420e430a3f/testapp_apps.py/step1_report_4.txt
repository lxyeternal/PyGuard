  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with obfuscated class name and attributes",
  "sources": "Import statement for Django AppConfig, class definition, attribute assignments",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flow involving external input or output",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and attribute names; no meaningful identifiers; no functional code logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with intentionally obfuscated class name and attribute names. It assigns string values that seem to mimic Django model field types and app label, but are not used in any functional manner. There are no inputs, outputs, or data processing; the code appears to be benign in isolation, possibly obfuscated for concealment. No malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or backdoors is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated but benign Django configuration class with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any actions beyond defining a class with obfuscated attribute names.",
