  "purpose": "A minimal Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and attribute names, containing static string assignments related to Django configuration.",
  "sources": "Static attribute assignments within the class; no external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; no functional logic or dynamic behavior; static strings used for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated Django AppConfig subclass with static string attributes. No external inputs, data flows, or network activity are present. The obfuscation appears to be a naming concealment rather than malicious intent. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), justified by the obfuscated identifiers. The security risk score is very low (~0.2), reflecting minimal threat. The code is benign and likely intended for concealment or privacy, with no evidence of sabotage or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated Django configuration class with no signs of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent based solely on this snippet. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
