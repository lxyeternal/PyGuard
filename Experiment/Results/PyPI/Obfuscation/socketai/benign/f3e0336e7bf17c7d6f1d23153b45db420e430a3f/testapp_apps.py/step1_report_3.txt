  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with obfuscated attribute names.",
  "sources": "The class declaration and attribute assignments within the Django AppConfig subclass.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The code assigns string values to class attributes but does not process external input or data flows.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and attribute names are obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No external inputs, secrets, or malicious code are evident. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and attribute names. The attributes assign simple string values: one appears to specify a database field type, and the other likely specifies an application label. There is no processing of untrusted input, no network activity, and no apparent malicious logic. The obfuscation may be for privacy or concealment, but does not imply malicious intent based solely on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard Django application configuration with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this isolated snippet.",
