  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with minimal configuration details.",
  "sources": "Import statement from django.apps and class attributes with string values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow to external systems detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated, with non-meaningful class and attribute names. No actual functional code or logic, just configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and attribute names. The attributes set database field type and app name, which are standard in Django configurations. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are present. No suspicious or malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The obfuscated naming could be a tactic to hide malicious intent, but in this context, it appears to be either deliberately obfuscated or auto-generated naming with no malicious implication. No data leaks, code injection, or external communication present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward Django application configuration with obfuscated names. No malicious activity or security issues are evident. The obfuscation might be a red flag but could also be benign. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
