      "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django CLI wrapper with an obfuscated function name. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this analysis, with malware score at 0, obfuscation moderate (~0.4), and low security risk (~0.1)."

The security risk is negligible, and the malware likelihood is zero. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The primary issues are obfuscation and insecure secret management, which are security best practice violations but not malicious. The malware score should remain low, and the overall security risk is moderate due to poor security practices but no active threats."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django component for dynamic form and model handling, with no evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors. The primary security concern is the lack of input validation on user-supplied parameters used for model and method retrieval, which could be exploited if an attacker supplies malicious input. The malware score remains at 0, and obfuscation is moderate. The security risk score should be elevated to reflect the potential for injection or misuse due to unvalidated dynamic method calls, estimated around 0.5."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and dynamic behavior that could be used to hide malicious activity or backdoors. While no direct malicious actions are evident, the suspicious patterns warrant further investigation of the 'django_dynamic_admin_forms' package and the behavior of the imported class. The current scores are appropriate, but increased scrutiny is recommended to confirm safety."

The scores assigned are justified, and the obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not indicate malicious intent based solely on this static code. Maintaining current low malware and risk scores is appropriate; obfuscation should be noted but not overinterpreted without further context."
