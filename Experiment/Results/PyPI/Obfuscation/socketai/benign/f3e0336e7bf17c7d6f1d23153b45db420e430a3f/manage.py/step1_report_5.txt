  "purpose": "Set up environment for running Django management commands",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, importing Django modules, command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line (which executes commands based on sys.argv)",
  "flows": "sys.argv -> execute_from_command_line -> Django management commands",
  "anomalies": "Code is obfuscated with a non-descriptive function name; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard Django setup",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a non-descriptive name that sets a Django environment variable and then executes a management command based on command-line arguments. It includes standard Django initialization logic with exception handling for missing Django. The code appears to be typical for a Django project's entry point without any suspicious or malicious operations. No external data is read aside from command-line args; no network activity or file access beyond environment setup; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Django project entry point with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It simply initializes the environment and runs management commands as intended.",
