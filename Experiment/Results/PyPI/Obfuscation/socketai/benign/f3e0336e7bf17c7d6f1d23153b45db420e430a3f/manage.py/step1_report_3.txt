  "purpose": "This script initializes a Django management command interface, setting the environment variable for Django settings and executing command-line instructions.",
  "sources": "os.environ.setdefault() to set environment variable, import from django.core.management, sys.argv for command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "execute_from_command_line(sys.argv) which executes commands based on input arguments",
  "flows": "sys.argv → execute_from_command_line → Django commands execution",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'uwjJwcbTiolKegzHwXhSMtUNIXLHMvXs' is obfuscated and non-descriptive; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code sets a Django environment variable, handles ImportError, and runs command-line Django management commands. The obfuscated function name may suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but the code performs a standard Django setup and command execution. No suspicious input handling, data leakage, or malicious code present. It appears to be a typical Django management script with obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Django management execution wrapper with obfuscated function naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within the provided code.",
