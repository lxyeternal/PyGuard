  "purpose": "Assigning a version string to a variable",

  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears to be a random string of characters, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious. No data flow or suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name and a version string. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, and no suspicious code patterns. The variable name does not match common naming conventions and appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone is not indicative of malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or other security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with an unusual variable name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The snippet is benign.",
