{
  "purpose": "Assign a version string to an obfuscated variable name, likely for configuration or version tracking.",
  "sources": "The variable assignment itself; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Single data flow: hardcoded string assigned to variable; no source-to-sink flow involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, but this is common in configuration or auto-generated code; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward assignment of the string \"3.2.8\" to a variable with an obfuscated name. No malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior are present. The obfuscated variable name alone does not imply malicious intent, especially given the simplicity of the code. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), and the security risk score is 0. The high confidence (around 0.9) reflects the benign and trivial nature of this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, serving likely as a version or configuration indicator. The obfuscated variable name does not indicate malicious intent in this context. No security risks or malicious behavior are present, and the scores are consistent with this assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "malware": 0,
