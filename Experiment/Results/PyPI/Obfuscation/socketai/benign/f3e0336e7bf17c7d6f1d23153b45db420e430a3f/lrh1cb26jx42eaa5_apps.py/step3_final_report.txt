{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and attribute names, likely for configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Class definition and static string attribute assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; static code with no input/output operations.",
  "flows": "N/A — static code, no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and attribute, but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated identifiers and a fixed string attribute. No dynamic behavior, input handling, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation appears consistent and intentional but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code. Security risk is minimal (around 0.1-0.2), justified by obfuscation but no active vulnerabilities. Confidence in benign assessment is high (around 0.8-0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but benign. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The static nature and lack of suspicious operations support a safe assessment, though obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring in broader contexts.",
