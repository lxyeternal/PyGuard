{
  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with an obfuscated class name and a string attribute.",
  "sources": "Code reads its own class name and string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Class declaration and attribute assignment; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name (obfuscated), no typical naming conventions, but no malicious patterns. The string attribute appears static.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with an obfuscated class name and a single string attribute containing 'django_dynamic_admin_forms'. There are no input sources, network calls, or dynamic code execution. The class and attribute are static, and no suspicious behavior or malicious intent is evident. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated Django application configuration class with no malicious behavior. The obfuscation is unusual but not inherently malicious. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
