    "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., qJxwjQNhsHtjelYVUKbMvbdRKILnnucc, JBKQxDxUtpMyyDmPVqNrEuysCPscKOtN).",
    "Configuration of sensitive-looking setting 'JBKQxDxUtpMyyDmPVqNrEuysCPscKOtN' with a value that resembles a password or secret.",
    "Configuration key 'qJxwjQNhsHtjelYVUKbMvbdRKILnnucc' appears to be a list of Django apps, which is normal, but the obfuscation raises suspicion.",
    "No actual malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors observed."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up Django with a list of installed apps and a secret key, all with obfuscated variable names. No data is read from untrusted sources, and no external network communication or sensitive data leakage is evident. The presence of obfuscated variables and a secret key-like value suggests possible concealment, but there is no direct evidence of malicious intent or harmful actions. The configuration appears to be standard for a Django project, with some naming obfuscation that might be suspicious but is not definitively malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Django configuration with obfuscated variable names and a possibly sensitive secret key. There is no direct malicious behavior or malware present. The obfuscation might be suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. Overall, low confidence in malicious activity.",
