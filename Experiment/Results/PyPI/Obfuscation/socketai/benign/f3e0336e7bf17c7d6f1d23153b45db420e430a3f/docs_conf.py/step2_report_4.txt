  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues in code?**  \n  The code performs dynamic Django configuration with obfuscated variable names, imports a third-party module, and sets a secret key. No explicit malicious actions are visible.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The use of obfuscated variable names and hardcoded secrets is poor security practice but not inherently malicious. No code errors are evident.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0.2 — consistent, as no malicious activity is observed.  \n  - Security risk: 0.4 — reasonable given obfuscation and secrets exposure.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 — justified due to heavy obfuscation.  \n  - Overall, scores seem reasonable.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  Not applicable; all scores are below or around 0.5, indicating low to moderate concern.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  The script is a standard Django setup with obfuscated variable names and a hardcoded secret key. No malicious actions are evident.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  The main concern is poor security practice—exposing secrets in code and obfuscation. No malicious code detected.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — aligns with poor security practices but no active threat.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Scores are consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  Similar to previous reports: obfuscated variable names, hardcoded secret key, standard Django setup.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No malicious activity; only poor security practice.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Consistent scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  Same pattern: obfuscated variables, secret key, standard setup, no malicious actions.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  Same as above, poor security practice but no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — justified.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 — justified.\n\n- **Conclusion:**  \n  Scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  Same pattern: obfuscation, hardcoded secret, no malicious activity.\n\n- **Errors or flaws?**  \n  No malicious code; only security best practices are lacking.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.  \n  - Security risk: 0.2 — consistent.  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 — justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign a low malware score (0-0.2). No evidence of malicious activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Consistently high (0.7), justified by heavy variable name obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly higher than 0.2 in some reports (up to 0.4), reflecting poor security practices (hardcoded secrets, obfuscation). Given no active malicious behavior, a risk score of 0.2-0.3 might be more appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The code itself appears to be a standard Django setup with obfuscation and secrets exposed, which is a security concern but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain low, around **0.1** to **0.2**.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Justified at **0.7**.\n\n- **Risk score:** Should be **0.2** — reflecting poor security practices but no active threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Recommended Value | Justification                                              |\n|-----------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware         | 0.1 – 0.2           | No malicious activity detected; obfuscation is not malicious. |\n| Obfuscated      | 0.7                 | Heavy variable name obfuscation justified.                 |\n| Security Risk   | 0.2                 | Poor security practices (secrets in code, obfuscation) but no active threats. |\n\n**Note:** The current scores are generally reasonable, but the malware score could be slightly lowered to reflect the absence of malicious behavior more accurately.",
