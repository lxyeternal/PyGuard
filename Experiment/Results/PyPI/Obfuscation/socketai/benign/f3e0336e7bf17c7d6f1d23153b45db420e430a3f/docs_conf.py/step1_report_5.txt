  "purpose": "Configure Django settings and import a dynamic admin forms module for a Django project.",
  "sources": "os.path, sys.argv, settings.configure, environment variables, imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Settings are configured before importing the module, but no untrusted data flows to critical functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., qJxwjQNhsHtjelYVUKbMvbdRKILnnucc, JBKQxDxUtpMyyDmPVqNrEuysCPscKOtN), which may suggest an attempt to hide intent. Hardcoded secret key ('ASDFjklö123456890') embedded in code. The code loads configurations and modules dynamically, but nothing explicitly malicious or suspicious is present.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up Django environment with a specific list of installed apps and a secret key, both hardcoded. It imports and uses a dynamically named module, which is obfuscated, potentially to hide its purpose. No untrusted input is processed, and no external network or file operations are performed based on user input. The obfuscated variable names and the static secret key may indicate an attempt at concealment, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote code execution, or other malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard Django setup with obfuscated variable names and a hardcoded secret key. While the obfuscation could be suspicious, there is no direct evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior in this code fragment.",
