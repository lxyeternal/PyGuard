  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The primary issues are obfuscation and insecure secret management, which are security best practice violations but not malicious. The malware score should remain low, and the overall security risk is moderate due to poor security practices but no active threats."
