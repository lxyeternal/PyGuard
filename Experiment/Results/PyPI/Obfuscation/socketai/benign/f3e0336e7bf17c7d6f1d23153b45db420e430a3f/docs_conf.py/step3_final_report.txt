  "purpose": "Configure Django environment with obfuscated variables and import a third-party module for dynamic admin forms.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded secret key, obfuscated variable assignments, module imports, settings configuration.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no network, file, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated variables and secret key are set during configuration; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names, hardcoded secret key, dynamic configuration, and import of external module.",
  "analysis": "The code performs Django setup with heavily obfuscated variable names and a hardcoded secret key, which are security concerns but do not constitute malicious behavior. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code execution are present. The obfuscation may be intended to conceal the code's purpose but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The secret key exposure is a security flaw but not malicious. The module imported is a legitimate third-party library. Overall, the code appears to be a standard Django configuration with obfuscation and poor security practices, but no active malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. The primary issues are obfuscation and insecure secret management, which are security best practice violations but not malicious. The malware score should remain low, and the overall security risk is moderate due to poor security practices but no active threats.",
