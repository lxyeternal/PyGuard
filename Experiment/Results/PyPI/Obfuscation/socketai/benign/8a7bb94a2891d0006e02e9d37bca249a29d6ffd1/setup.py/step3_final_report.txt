  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leakage or malicious effect pathways identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name 'dg064kh62n78ywav' suggests obfuscation or randomness; external download URL is legitimate but warrants verification.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with no malicious code, dynamic execution, or obfuscation techniques. The package name appears obfuscated, which could be an attempt to disguise malicious intent, but no active malicious behavior is detected. The external URL points to a legitimate GitHub archive. Malware score is 0, as no malicious payloads or behaviors are present. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.5), reflecting suspicion due to the package name. The security risk score remains low (~0.2), primarily due to the obfuscated name and external URL, which should be verified. Overall, the code is benign but warrants verification of the URL and package source to rule out supply chain risks.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name and external URL. No malicious activity or code injection is evident. The main concern is the obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but current evidence does not support this. The malware score remains at 0, with a moderate obfuscation suspicion and low security risk. Verification of the external URL and package source is recommended before deployment.",
