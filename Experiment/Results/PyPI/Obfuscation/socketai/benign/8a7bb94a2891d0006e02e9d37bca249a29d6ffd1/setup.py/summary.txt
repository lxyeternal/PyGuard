  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name and external URL. No malicious activity or code injection is evident. The main concern is the obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but current evidence does not support this. The malware score remains at 0, with a moderate obfuscation suspicion and low security risk. Verification of the external URL and package source is recommended before deployment."
