      "obfuscated": 0.5,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a benign setup script with an obfuscated package name and external URL. No malicious activity or code injection is evident. The main concern is the obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but current evidence does not support this. The malware score remains at 0, with a moderate obfuscation suspicion and low security risk. Verification of the external URL and package source is recommended before deployment."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The most suspicious code (Report 2) justifies high malware and obfuscation scores, reflecting likely malicious activity. Other reports are benign, with scores appropriately low. Minor adjustments to risk scores in benign reports could improve consistency, but current scores are reasonable. The assessment aligns with the signals and descriptions provided."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate DNS filtering or proxy tool, possibly used for privacy, censorship circumvention, or traffic manipulation. There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious payloads. However, the high obfuscation and dynamic rule loading introduce security concerns, especially if external rule files are compromised or malicious. Continuous monitoring of rule integrity and source trustworthiness is recommended when deploying such systems."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign IP validation utility with rule import functionality. The obfuscation and dynamic regex compilation warrant caution but do not constitute malicious activity. The bug in the return statement should be fixed, but it does not impact security. Overall, there is no evidence of malware, and the security risk is low."

The obfuscation and bug suggest incomplete or intentionally obscured code but do not indicate malicious activity. The primary action should be fixing the bug for proper operation."
