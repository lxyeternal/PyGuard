  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of 'exec()', 'eval()', network modules ('socket', 'subprocess'), environment variables, stdin inputs, and dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network communication, system command execution, environment variable access, and untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input sources (stdin, environment variables) passing through 'exec'/'eval' or network modules leading to potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic execution functions with untrusted data, obfuscated or complex code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity indicators.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion if it employs 'exec'/'eval' on untrusted input, imports network modules without clear purpose, or contains obfuscated code. Benign scripts lack these features. The high malware score (0.85) and obfuscation (0.7) are justified by behaviors indicative of malicious intent. Low scores (0) in benign cases align with the absence of suspicious patterns. Slightly elevated risk scores (0.2) in benign scripts are acceptable but could be marginally lowered for consistency. Overall, the scores are consistent with the described behaviors and indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The most suspicious code (Report 2) justifies high malware and obfuscation scores, reflecting likely malicious activity. Other reports are benign, with scores appropriately low. Minor adjustments to risk scores in benign reports could improve consistency, but current scores are reasonable. The assessment aligns with the signals and descriptions provided.",
