  "conclusion": "The most suspicious code (Report 2) justifies high malware and obfuscation scores, reflecting likely malicious activity. Other reports are benign, with scores appropriately low. Minor adjustments to risk scores in benign reports could improve consistency, but current scores are reasonable. The assessment aligns with the signals and descriptions provided."
