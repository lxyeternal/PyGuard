  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate DNS filtering or proxy tool, possibly used for privacy, censorship circumvention, or traffic manipulation. There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious payloads. However, the high obfuscation and dynamic rule loading introduce security concerns, especially if external rule files are compromised or malicious. Continuous monitoring of rule integrity and source trustworthiness is recommended when deploying such systems."
