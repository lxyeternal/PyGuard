      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation with nonsensical variable and parameter names, raising suspicion. However, there is no evidence of active malicious behavior or code execution. The obfuscation could be benign or an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Caution is advised, and further analysis is recommended before use."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious API client with no signs of sabotage or malware. The minor security concern about SHA-1 does not elevate the overall risk significantly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, which is justified given the use of an outdated hashing algorithm. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose."
