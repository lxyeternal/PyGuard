  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the code's behavior, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- The code is a Python API wrapper for Phabricator's Conduit API.\n- It manages sessions, signs requests with SHA-1, and handles errors via custom exceptions.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious code, or malicious behavior is detected.\n- The use of SHA-1 for signing is outdated but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n\n- **Request signing with SHA-1:** Although insecure for cryptographic purposes, it's a common pattern in legacy API signatures. Not malicious but a security concern.\n- **Optional 'cert' parameter:** Used in signature generation; source and validation are unclear but not suspicious.\n- **No hardcoded secrets:** The code expects credentials to be supplied externally.\n\n**No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code.**\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Finds no malicious intent, notes use of SHA-1, and considers the code legitimate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Scores seem reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n#### **Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1; no malicious behavior, standard API client.\n- **Scores:** identical reasoning, malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate. No change needed.\n\n#### **Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Same conclusion; no suspicious activity, standard API wrapper.\n- **Scores:** same as above, reasonable.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n#### **Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** No malicious behavior, standard session management, uses SHA-1.\n- **Scores:** consistent, no issues.\n\n#### **Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity, standard API client, optional certificate.\n- **Scores:** aligned, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Final scoring justifications:\n\n- **Malware score (0):** No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated (0):** Clear, readable code with no obfuscation.\n- **Risk score (~0.2):** Slightly elevated due to the use of SHA-1 for signing, which is outdated but not malicious. This is acceptable, given the context.\n\n### **Overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to SHA-1, but acceptable)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nThe reports are consistent with the code's behavior. All scores are reasonable, and no adjustments are necessary. The code appears to be a legitimate API client with no malicious intent or behavior.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Keep malware=0, obfuscated=0.  \n- Maintain securityRisk=0.2, justified by the use of SHA-1.  \n- Confidence remains high at 0.9.\n\n---\n\n**Work through completed.**",
