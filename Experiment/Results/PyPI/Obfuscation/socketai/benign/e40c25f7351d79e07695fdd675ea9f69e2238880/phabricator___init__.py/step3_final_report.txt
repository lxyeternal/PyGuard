{
  "purpose": "A Python API client wrapper for Phabricator's Conduit API, managing sessions, signing requests, and handling errors.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as host, user, cert, and optional user_agent; data sent in POST requests to API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to API endpoints; request signing with SHA-1; JSON responses processed for errors or results.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to generate request signatures; requests are sent to API endpoints; responses are parsed, errors raised if present, results returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of SHA-1 for request signing (outdated but not malicious); optional 'cert' parameter used without validation; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward API client for Phabricator, managing sessions, signing requests with SHA-1, and handling errors via custom exceptions. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The only security concern is the use of SHA-1, which is outdated but not inherently malicious. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors. All signals point to a legitimate, standard API wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious API client with no signs of sabotage or malware. The minor security concern about SHA-1 does not elevate the overall risk significantly. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.2, which is justified given the use of an outdated hashing algorithm. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
