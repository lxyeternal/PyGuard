{
  "purpose": "The code primarily defines type aliases and imports for type hinting and annotations, likely used in a larger project for type safety and clarity.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (re, sys, types, datetime, decimal, ipaddress, urllib, uuid) and internal modules (parsing, printing, stream, types). No direct data input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or untrusted data handling present. No code writes, network operations, or data leaks identified.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or untrusted data propagation evident; the code only sets up type aliases and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Extensive obfuscated-looking type alias names and non-descriptive variable names, but this appears to be intentionally obfuscated naming convention for internal types. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are visible. No dynamic code execution or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of type alias declarations and conditional imports based on Python version, used for static type checking. It does not include executable logic, data processing, or network communication. The obfuscated names suggest code obfuscation or code generated by a tool, but no malicious behavior is apparent. All imported modules are standard or well-known internal modules, with no indication of malicious intent. There are no source-to-sink data flows, no input handling, and no apparent malicious code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a non-malicious, obfuscated setup for type annotations in a larger Python project. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The obfuscation seems to be for internal code organization rather than malicious purpose.",
