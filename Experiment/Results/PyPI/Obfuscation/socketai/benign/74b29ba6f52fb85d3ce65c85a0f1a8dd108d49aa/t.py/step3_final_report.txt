{
  "purpose": "The code defines complex type aliases, conditional type logic based on Python version, and extensive import statements primarily for static type annotations and internal module setup. It appears to serve as a foundational or configuration module within a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries, internal modules, and type alias definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform runtime actions.",
  "flows": "Static type alias definitions and conditional type logic; no data flow or runtime data handling present.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and type alias names, which may hinder analysis but does not indicate malicious intent. No executable code, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup for type annotations with heavily obfuscated naming conventions. It contains no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. The obfuscation could be stylistic or protective but does not inherently suggest malicious behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code, noting the heavy obfuscation but lack of active malicious indicators. The malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious activity. Risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), justified by the obfuscation but not indicating active threats. The overall structure and content suggest this is a benign, obfuscated configuration or type setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, obfuscated setup for type annotations and module imports, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The current security scores are appropriate and should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0.75, risk=0.2.",
