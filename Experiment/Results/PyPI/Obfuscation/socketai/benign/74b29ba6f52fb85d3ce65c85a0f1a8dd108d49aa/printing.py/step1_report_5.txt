{
  "purpose": "Defines a data class with several configuration options and default values.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only initializes a class with default values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only creates an instance of the class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and attribute names appear intentionally obfuscated with nonsensical or random strings, which could be a sign of hiding malicious intent or simply code obfuscation. There are no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass with multiple attributes initialized to default values, some boolean flags, and string values. The class and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is often a tactic used to hide malicious code. However, there are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code is benign in its current form but could be part of a larger, obfuscated codebase. The absence of external input processing and malicious sinks suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated class definition with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. The obfuscated names are suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent by themselves.",
