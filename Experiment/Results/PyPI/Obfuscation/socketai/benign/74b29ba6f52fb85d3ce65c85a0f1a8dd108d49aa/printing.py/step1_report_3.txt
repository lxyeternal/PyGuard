  "purpose": "Define a data class with default configuration values for some unspecified application or module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from dataclasses, class attribute definitions with default values",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class and an instance",
  "anomalies": "Class name and attribute names are obfuscated, which may be suspicious. No actual behavior or method implementations are present. The code appears intentionally obfuscated or designed to hide intent, but no malicious activity such as network access, data exfiltration, or code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports dataclass and defines a class with obscure, randomly generated attribute names and default values. The class is instantiated immediately after. There are no functions, no method calls, no external data handling, and no behavior beyond static data definition. The obfuscated naming could suggest malicious intent to hide functionality, but on its own, this code does not perform any malicious actions or risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data class with obfuscated identifiers and no active behavior. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks based solely on this code fragment. The obfuscation could be suspicious, but it does not inherently indicate malicious activity.",
