  "conclusion": "The code is a static, heavily obfuscated configuration data class with no evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain low given the lack of active malicious behavior. The current assessments are appropriate; no modifications are necessary."
