  "purpose": "Utility functions for data validation, parsing, and type conversions, operating on object attributes and parameters.",
  "sources": "Object attributes such as 'fragment', 'CFCRpujFUDTGJadaBVustClAvIaNHvQG', and input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Conversion functions, exception raising, and data parsing routines; no external or network sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from object attributes or parameters into validation/conversion functions, with exception handling on failure.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation through variable names and error messages, repetitive exception handling, and inconsistent naming conventions suggest intentional obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple validation and parsing functions relying on standard Python libraries such as 'decimal', 'datetime', 'ipaddress', 're', 'uuid', and 'urllib'. The obfuscated variable names and error messages indicate an attempt to conceal intent, but the functions perform standard data validation, type conversions, and parsing without network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads. Exception handling is consistent and standard. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, backdoors, or external communication are present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for data validation and parsing, heavily obfuscated but without evidence of malicious intent. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware risk remains low. Overall, the code appears benign, serving as a utility module with no active threats.",
