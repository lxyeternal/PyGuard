{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define custom exception handling and utility functions/classes possibly related to parsing or string processing, with no clear malicious intent or harmful functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include function parameters such as strings and integers passed to constructors and methods.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include raising exceptions with formatted messages, but no direct data leaks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through functions and constructors, with exception messages generated based on string processing; no external or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and class names, complex string formatting logic, and a seemingly unnecessary helper function for line and column calculation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns are evident. No obfuscated code or code injection techniques detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with elaborate message formatting, a helper function for line/column calculation in strings, and a class that encapsulates a fragment of text with methods to generate exception objects. There are no network operations, external calls, or file I/O. The variable names are non-descriptive, likely obfuscated, but the logic appears to be straightforward string processing and exception handling. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. It mainly involves string handling, custom exception creation, and utility functions, with obfuscated naming that could be for code minimization or obscurity but not malicious intent.",
