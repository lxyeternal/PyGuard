  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, heavily obfuscated parser library with no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation is high but appears to serve to conceal complexity rather than malicious intent. Malware score should remain at 0, with high obfuscation score (~0.9), and a low security risk (~0.2). The code is likely benign but warrants cautious review in security-sensitive contexts due to obfuscation."
