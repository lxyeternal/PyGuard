{
  "purpose": "The code consists solely of import statements with heavily obfuscated module and variable names, likely part of a larger package or generated code. No active logic, data flow, or external interactions are present.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and types, with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data passing through functions or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of import names and identifiers, which could be for concealment or code protection but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is static, import-only, with no dynamic execution, network activity, or data manipulation. Obfuscated names are consistent with code generation or obfuscation practices. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The high confidence scores reflect the static nature and lack of active threats. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent based solely on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is detected in this static import segment. The overall security risk is low, but further review of the entire codebase is recommended if more active or dynamic code is present.",
