  "purpose": "The code provides functions to create and sign S/MIME signed messages and to encrypt data using PKCS7 envelopes, likely for secure email communication.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from function parameters (bJMMEJsXqOCpfRMnAMBCrnbrsesohWQZ, vvjUffHEapjYfEbcCVIPefNWAAYTyqLq, lqqnnaxgMVDKFIyZDRacBWSJDltOEBBq, KxwGtLIRyXRiBSeKeyILGkAnGKISyTBM). Loads PEM certificates and private keys from parameters.",
  "sinks": "Generates MIME email parts (signed and encrypted). Uses cryptography library functions to process keys and certificates; the resulting MIME parts are returned but not transmitted or stored directly within this code.",
  "flows": "Input data (message, certificates, private key) flows into cryptographic operations (signing, encrypting). Signed data flows into MIME structures; encryption wraps data into PKCS7 envelope, then into MIME parts.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated variable names (e.g., lGvLjKgmdajjDxEYmFlomqAuhjIUGiby, wwgzSzJNJuPmLDSmuueoAmXBxvXTqkfd). No hardcoded secrets detected. Slightly unusual import ordering and parameter naming. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed. No external network activity or data leaks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard cryptographic libraries for handling certificates and signing/encryption tasks. Two functions perform cryptographic message creation: one for signing (lGvLjKgmdajjDxEYmFlomqAuhjIUGiby), the other for encryption (wxNRpEHoPycjVUjCmVUOUtqZKTgEzhMS). Both functions process certificates and keys provided as parameters, assemble cryptographic structures, and generate MIME email parts. The variable names and function names are intentionally obfuscated but do not contain malicious code or behaviors. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or execute untrusted code. The logic adheres to standard practices for secure email message creation. There are no indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements standard cryptographic operations for signing and encrypting messages, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscated variable names are likely to hinder readability but do not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and purposeful, focusing on secure message preparation.",
