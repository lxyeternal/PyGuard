  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code execution points such as eval, exec, dynamic imports, environment variables, network calls, and file operations.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data flows into eval/exec, network transmissions, file writes, or environment variable usage that could leak data or execute malicious payloads.",
  "flows": "Sources like unvalidated input or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, inconsistent formatting, and network activity.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates typical data processing with no overt malicious signs; code appears benign. Report 2 lacks code, so analysis isn't possible. Report 3 shows signs of obfuscation, unsafe dynamic code execution, and potential vulnerabilities, with eval/exec and cryptic variables; scores are justified but could slightly increase malware suspicion. Report 4 has no code, so no issues. Report 5 exhibits multiple suspicious behaviors including obfuscation, eval(), hardcoded secrets, network activity, and inconsistent formatting, indicating high malicious potential. Scores are consistent with the evidence, with Report 3's malware score adjusted from 0.3 to 0.2–0.3 and Report 5's scores remaining high due to multiple indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are low risk with no code or benign behavior. Reports 3 and 5 show significant suspicious activity, with obfuscation and unsafe code practices justifying high malware and security risk scores. Slight adjustments to malware suspicion in Report 3 improve accuracy. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence, emphasizing caution for Reports 3 and 5.",
