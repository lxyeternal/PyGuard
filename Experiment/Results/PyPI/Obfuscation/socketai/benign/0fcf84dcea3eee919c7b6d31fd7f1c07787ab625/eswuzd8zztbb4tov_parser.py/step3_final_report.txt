  "purpose": "Configuration and templating for email system, obfuscated names, no active malicious code.",
  "sources": "YAML files, function parameters, environment variables, input dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "YAML loading, Jinja2 rendering, file reading, validation.",
  "flows": "Data from configs/files into validation, templating, YAML parsing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class/variable names, custom encoding functions, dynamic templating, no secrets or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code handles configuration validation and templating securely, with no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, code execution, or data exfiltration. Obfuscation and dynamic templating could be misused if inputs are untrusted, but no such exploitation is evident here. Validation is performed with Cerberus, and YAML is loaded with 'safe_load'. The encoding functions are standard. Overall, the code appears to be a configuration utility with obfuscation that warrants caution but no active malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a configuration and templating utility with obfuscation. No active malware or malicious behavior is detected. The main concern is potential template injection if untrusted inputs are used, which should be mitigated through input validation or sandboxing. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
