      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to its obfuscated parameter name and value, which deviate from standard setup practices. While no direct malicious activity is observed, the obfuscation warrants further investigation. The low malware score is appropriate, but the high obfuscation score suggests caution. It is recommended to review the package further before deployment or distribution."

      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate cryptographic email handling code performing signing and encryption operations. No evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain compromise is present. The primary concern is obfuscation and lack of validation, which could be exploited if misused. Overall, the code appears benign with a low security risk, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review before deployment in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is stylistic, not malicious. Scores should remain at malware 0, obfuscated around 0.75, and security risk near 0.1 to reflect minimal risk."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate SMTP email utility with DNS resolution and message formatting capabilities. The obfuscation and incomplete hostname function warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent. No malicious payloads or sabotage signals are detected. The overall security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to code quality issues and obfuscation, which could be exploited if used maliciously. Continuous monitoring and input validation are recommended if deployed in security-sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The provided security reports are generally accurate and consistent with their scoring. Report 1 exhibits significant suspicious activity justifying high malware and risk scores. Reports without code are correctly scored as benign. Overall, the assessments are justified, with no need for major revisions. Continued monitoring of similar patterns is recommended."

      "conclusion": "Most reports are low risk with no code or benign behavior. Reports 3 and 5 show significant suspicious activity, with obfuscation and unsafe code practices justifying high malware and security risk scores. Slight adjustments to malware suspicion in Report 3 improve accuracy. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence, emphasizing caution for Reports 3 and 5."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate email construction and signing library with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious payloads. The primary concern is cautious handling of untrusted inputs, which is standard in email systems. The overall assessment supports a very low malware likelihood and moderate risk due to obfuscation and input handling considerations."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a configuration and templating utility with obfuscation. No active malware or malicious behavior is detected. The main concern is potential template injection if untrusted inputs are used, which should be mitigated through input validation or sandboxing. Scores are consistent with the analysis."

The obfuscated module names warrant further inspection if their contents are unknown, but static analysis indicates low security risk."
