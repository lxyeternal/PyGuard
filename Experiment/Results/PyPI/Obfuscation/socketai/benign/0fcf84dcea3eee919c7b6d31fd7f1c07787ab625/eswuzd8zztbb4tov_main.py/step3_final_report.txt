  "purpose": "A script for sending emails based on YAML configuration files, supporting SMTP relay, TLS, attachments, and certificate handling.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments, configuration files, certificate files loaded from disk.",
  "sinks": "SMTP server connection, file reading for certificates and attachments, email message creation.",
  "flows": "Input arguments and config files → certificate loading and email construction → SMTP connection and message sending.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and module names are obfuscated, but no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a legitimate email sender utility with configurable options. Obfuscation appears cosmetic, primarily affecting variable and module names. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. Certificate files are loaded from disk in a standard manner. The scores assigned in the reports align with the benign nature of the code, with low malware and risk scores and moderate obfuscation reflecting variable naming obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate email utility with obfuscation that seems cosmetic rather than malicious. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. The obfuscated module names warrant further inspection if their contents are unknown, but static analysis indicates low security risk.",
