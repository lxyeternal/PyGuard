  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with optional error message",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed in the code",
  "sinks": "No sink operations or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present",
  "anomalies": "The class uses obfuscated-looking class and variable names; no clear reason for such naming, which may be considered suspicious or a red flag for obfuscation or concealment",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with a constructor that accepts an optional message parameter. The __str__ method returns either a default error message or the string representation of the provided message. The variable and class names are intentionally obscure, which could be an attempt to hide purpose, but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident. No external input handling, network activity, or sensitive data processing is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple custom exception class with obfuscated naming. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation might be suspicious but is not inherently malicious.",
