  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition for handling specific errors with optional message",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code defines a class but does not process external data",
  "targets": "No sinks; no data flow to external systems or outputs",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only defines a class with a __str__ method",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure class and variable names, but no malicious activity or suspicious code structures detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The class has an initializer that stores an optional message and a __str__ method that returns the message or a default string. No input/output operations, network calls, or obfuscated logic are present. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or for code brevity, not malicious.",
