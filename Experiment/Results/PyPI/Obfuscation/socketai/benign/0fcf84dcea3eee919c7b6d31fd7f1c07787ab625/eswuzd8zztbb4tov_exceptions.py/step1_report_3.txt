  "purpose": "Custom exception class that encapsulates an error message or object.",
  "sources": "Input source is the parameter 'wDAjHhTtXAXioMWkCQVbFCrjlJhMSncl' passed during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or transmit data; it only stores and converts the input to string.",
  "flows": "Input parameter is stored in an instance variable and returned as a string if requested.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and class names; no clear purpose or documentation; no malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The class defines a custom exception with an obfuscated name and an optional message. It stores the message in an instance variable and returns it in __str__ method, or a generic message if none provided. There are no external data sources, network calls, or suspicious logic. The code appears to be a harmless, albeit obfuscated, custom exception definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with obfuscated naming, serving as a container for an error message. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
