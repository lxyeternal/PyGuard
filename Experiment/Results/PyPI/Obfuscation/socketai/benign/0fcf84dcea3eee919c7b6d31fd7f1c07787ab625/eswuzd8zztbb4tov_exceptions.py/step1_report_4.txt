  "purpose": "Custom exception class for handling specific errors with optional message",
  "sources": "Initialization method (__init__) where it accepts an optional message parameter",
  "sinks": "String conversion method (__str__) which outputs the message",
  "flows": "Input parameter in __init__ flows to __str__ via the stored attribute for string representation",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated class and variable names; no clear malicious intent, but the naming obscurity could hide malicious purpose",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The constructor (__init__) accepts an optional message and stores it. The __str__ method returns a default error message if no message is provided or the stringified message otherwise. There are no evident data leaks, network calls, or suspicious code behaviors. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but on the surface, the code merely implements a custom exception with no malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward custom exception class with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation could be malicious, but based on the functionality, it seems to be a benign wrapper for error messages.",
