{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with obfuscated naming, storing an optional message.",
  "sources": "The constructor accepts an optional message; no external data inputs are used.",
  "sinks": "The __str__ method returns the stored message; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input (optional message) flows from constructor to __str__ output; no external data flows involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no malicious code, network activity, or data leaks present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with obfuscated naming, storing an optional message and returning it via __str__. No external data sources, network activity, or malicious operations are evident. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The obfuscation scores are high, reflecting the naming style, but do not indicate malicious intent. The code poses no security threat and is consistent across analyses.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is stylistic, not malicious. Scores should remain at malware 0, obfuscated around 0.75, and security risk near 0.1 to reflect minimal risk.",
