  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to its obfuscated parameter name and value, which deviate from standard setup practices. While no direct malicious activity is observed, the obfuscation warrants further investigation. The low malware score is appropriate, but the high obfuscation score suggests caution. It is recommended to review the package further before deployment or distribution."
