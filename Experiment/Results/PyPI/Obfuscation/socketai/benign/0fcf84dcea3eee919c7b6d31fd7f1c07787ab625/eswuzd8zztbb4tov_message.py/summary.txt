  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate email construction and signing library with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious payloads. The primary concern is cautious handling of untrusted inputs, which is standard in email systems. The overall assessment supports a very low malware likelihood and moderate risk due to obfuscation and input handling considerations."
