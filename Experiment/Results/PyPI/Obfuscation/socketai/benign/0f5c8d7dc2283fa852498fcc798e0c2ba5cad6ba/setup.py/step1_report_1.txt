{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility module that performs data processing and possibly some network operations, but the exact purpose is unclear due to minimal context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from variables, function parameters, or external sources such as environment variables or file reads (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connection functions, file write/read operations, or system calls, but these are not explicitly identified in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., function parameters or environment variables) to processing functions, and possibly to network or file output functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or obvious malicious code snippets observed. No unusual language features or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data processing with standard Python functions. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication with suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The usage of third-party libraries appears typical. The lack of clear network or file output functions prevents definitive detection of malicious actions, but based on available information, the code looks benign.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility module with no indicators of malware or malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high given the limited and straightforward nature of the code.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
