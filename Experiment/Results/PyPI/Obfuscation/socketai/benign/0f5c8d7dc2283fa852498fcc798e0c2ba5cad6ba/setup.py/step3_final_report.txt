  "purpose": "Analysis of Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution points (e.g., eval, exec), hardcoded secrets, input/output functions, network operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network communications, execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input sources to dynamic execution or network transmission points, possibly via obfuscated code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation patterns, dynamic code execution, lack of documentation, inconsistent score justifications.",
  "analysis": "The reports generally assess benign code with low malware and obfuscation scores, high confidence in benign assessments, and low security risks. Report 2 indicates obfuscation and dynamic features, which are suspicious. The initial malware score of 0.4 underestimates suspicion; increasing it to 0.6 aligns better with the described obfuscation and dynamic code usage. Other reports are consistent with their benign conclusions. Scores are mostly justified, but slight adjustments improve accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 warrants a higher malware score (0.6) due to obfuscation and dynamic features, reflecting increased suspicion. Other reports are consistent with benign assessments. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, with minor adjustments to better represent the suspicion level in Report 2.",
