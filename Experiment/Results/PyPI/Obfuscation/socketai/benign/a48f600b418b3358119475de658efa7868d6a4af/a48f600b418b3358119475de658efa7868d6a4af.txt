      "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns consistent with obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion of malicious intent. The presence of eval/exec with untrusted input significantly increases the risk. Scores are adjusted to reflect these concerns, with malware at 0.65, obfuscated at 0.8, and overall security risk at 0.65. Further dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Earth Engine automation script with obfuscated variable names and minimal validation. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The primary concerns are obfuscation and validation gaps, which do not constitute malicious behavior but could be exploited if misused. Overall, the code's malware score is 0, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.4) and low security risk (~0.3)."
