  "purpose": "The code involves dynamic execution and environment variable access, indicating potential for malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, dynamic code execution functions (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, system commands, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or user input → eval/exec or dynamic code → system/network operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec with untrusted input, obfuscated code, dynamic execution, suspicious strings, or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables or user input, with potential use of eval/exec, which are high-risk functions if used improperly. Obfuscation or dynamic code execution patterns increase suspicion. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but patterns suggest possible malicious intent. The code's structure and behavior indicate a moderate to high security concern, especially if eval/exec are present with untrusted data. The obfuscation and dynamic execution elevate the malware and security risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns consistent with obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion of malicious intent. The presence of eval/exec with untrusted input significantly increases the risk. Scores are adjusted to reflect these concerns, with malware at 0.65, obfuscated at 0.8, and overall security risk at 0.65. Further dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment.",
