  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns consistent with obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion of malicious intent. The presence of eval/exec with untrusted input significantly increases the risk. Scores are adjusted to reflect these concerns, with malware at 0.65, obfuscated at 0.8, and overall security risk at 0.65. Further dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."
