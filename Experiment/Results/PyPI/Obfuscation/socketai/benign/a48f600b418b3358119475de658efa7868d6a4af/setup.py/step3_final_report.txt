{
  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script that reads README.md and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file into a variable; static strings for package name, version, classifiers, and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Read from file into variable; static parameters passed to setup() without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; inconsistent or nonsensical parameter usage in code snippets; package name appears random.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names that do not impact functionality. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. Obfuscation may be superficial or intended to conceal, but no evidence of malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but not inherently malicious. The package name and version are arbitrary. The code's structure is typical for a setup script, with no dynamic or unsafe operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. While variable names are suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet. Further inspection of the full package contents is recommended before distribution.",
