{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for visualizing images fetched from URLs or data batches, primarily for display purposes.",
  "sources": "HTTP requests to fetch images from URLs, data inputs for images or batches, and optional subtitle parameters.",
  "sinks": "Requests to external URLs for image retrieval; no data leaks or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Source: URL requests or data inputs -> Image processing and display functions -> visualization output.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated imports, verbose variable names, broad exception handling (`except: pass`), and non-descriptive function/variable names suggest superficial obfuscation but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code fetches images over the network, processes them for display, and arranges them in a grid. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or covert channels. The obfuscation appears superficial, mainly due to variable naming, but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscation score varies depending on the perceived naming obscurity, with some reports assigning moderate to high scores. The security risk remains low, primarily reflecting poor coding practices rather than security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for visualization purposes, with superficial obfuscation and poor coding style but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
