  "purpose": "Python package setup script for defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file, variable 'pXPeHVmiYFTcDtsofrlGfDYsxWrFZQbR' assigned to a string, used as a parameter in setup().",
  "sinks": "None evident; no network, file, or data exfiltration points present.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md into variable -> passing dependencies and metadata to setup() -> suspicious variable 'pXPeHVmiYFTcDtsofrlGfDYsxWrFZQbR' used as a parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; 'pXPeHVmiYFTcDtsofrlGfDYsxWrFZQbR' assigned a string 'text/markdown' but not used as a standard argument; appears misplaced or intentionally obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent. The variable 'pXPeHVmiYFTcDtsofrlGfDYsxWrFZQbR' is assigned 'text/markdown' but is used as a parameter, suggesting possible obfuscation or misplacement. No network activity, code execution, or malicious payloads are detected. The obfuscation and suspicious parameter warrant further review but do not confirm malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with obfuscation that raises suspicion but no active malicious activity. The unusual parameter warrants further investigation, but overall, the supply chain security risk is low.",
