  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, including reading the README file and specifying dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for package description, defining package dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "The code reads a local file and passes dependency list to setup(), no untrusted data flows or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names and obfuscated variable identifiers; no apparent malicious activity, but naming is suspiciously inconsistent and opaque.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup utilities, reads a README file with a seemingly obfuscated variable name, and calls setup() with package info and dependencies. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration observed. Variable obfuscation appears to be an attempt at hiding intent, but functionality remains standard for a setup script. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names that do not affect functionality. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
