  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility or module intended for data processing or functionality extension, but without specific context or comments, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, file inputs, or function parameters",
  "sinks": "Outputs data via print statements, writes to files, or network requests (if present)",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution observed; code structure appears straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for common security issues such as hardcoded secrets, unsafe data handling, or obfuscated patterns. No malicious behavior or code injection mechanisms were identified. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard, and no unusual network or file operations indicative of malware are present. Lack of comments limits full context understanding, but no signals of malicious intent or sabotage are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script or module with standard operations. Due to limited context, confidence is moderate, but no immediate threats are detected.",
