  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific task or set of tasks, but without seeing the actual code content, the exact purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from environment variables, configuration files, or network sources (if any are present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potentially dangerous sinks include network connections, file system writes, or execution of dynamic code based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or actions), possibly through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Possible anomalies include hard-coded credentials, unnecessary dynamic execution, obfuscated or confusing variable names, or unusual control flow structures.",
  "analysis": "Without specific code content, the analysis is limited to general observations: review should focus on any hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or dynamic code execution. Check for obfuscated code segments, suspicious imports, or API calls that could leak data or establish malicious connections. Ensure no hardcoded credentials, no use of dangerous functions like eval() with untrusted data, and no suspicious file or network activity.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of explicit code, a detailed conclusion cannot be provided. If code contains no suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or dynamic code execution, the risk is likely low. However, the review is incomplete without actual code content.",
