{
  "purpose": "Module setup importing constants, enums, objects, utils from 'netsgiro' and defining an obfuscated version string variable.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'netsgiro' package, reading module attributes and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; the version string assignment is static; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable name 'sSegKoRiwmliRCRzZTCzqFSscSsbMcNP' and a version string '1.3.0'. Use of wildcard imports (*).",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and a version string assigned to an obfuscated variable. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present. The obfuscated variable name suggests superficial obfuscation or placeholder usage but does not indicate malicious intent. Import pattern with star imports is common in package initialization but can be risky in larger codebases. Overall, the code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module setup with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security threats are detected. The obfuscation appears stylistic or placeholder, not malicious. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero.",
