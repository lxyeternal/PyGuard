{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module imports and defines an API version string, likely for a larger project related to netsgiro.",
  "sources": "Imports from various netsgiro modules and a version string assignment",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and defines a string",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'sSegKoRiwmliRCRzZTCzqFSscSsbMcNP' is highly obfuscated and nonsensical, which is unusual and potentially suspicious; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard import statements from a local package and sets a version string. The variable name is intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide its purpose. No malicious actions, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident. The code's structure is typical of a Python module's initialization segment, with no immediate security risks or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard module setup with heavily obfuscated variable naming. No malicious behavior or security threats are apparent based on this fragment. The obfuscated variable name warrants caution but does not alone indicate malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0.7,
