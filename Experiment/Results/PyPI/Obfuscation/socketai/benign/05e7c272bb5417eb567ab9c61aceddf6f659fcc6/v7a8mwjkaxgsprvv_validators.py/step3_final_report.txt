  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network connections, dynamic code execution, base64 decoding, imports, input/output streams.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, environment variables, file system, system commands, data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into code execution or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscation, dynamic execution, base64 decoding, reflection, conditional logic, obscure imports, suspicious patterns indicating potential malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code shows patterns of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical indicators of malicious or covert activities. No explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, but the suspicious techniques justify elevated scores. Benign code lacks such patterns. Missing or incomplete code prevents assessment in some reports. The scores are generally consistent with the described behaviors, with higher suspicion in code employing obfuscation and dynamic techniques.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns but lacks confirmed malicious payloads. Scores are appropriate, with moderate risk due to obfuscation and potential exfiltration capabilities. Overall, the code is likely benign but warrants caution in suspicious cases.",
