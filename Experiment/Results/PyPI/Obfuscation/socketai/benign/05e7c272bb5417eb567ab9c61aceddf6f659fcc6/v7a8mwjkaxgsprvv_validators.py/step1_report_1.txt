  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific task or computation, but without additional context, it is unclear whether it is benign or malicious.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function arguments, environment variables, or external modules; specific sources are not explicitly shown due to lack of visible code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writing, or system commands, but these are not clearly indicated in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions and potentially to output or external interfaces; detailed flow cannot be determined without seeing the full code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are visible in the provided snippet; code structure appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is absent or incomplete, limiting detailed analysis. Based on the visible structure, there are no immediate signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. However, the lack of context prevents a definitive assessment. It is recommended to review the full code, especially parts interacting with external systems or handling untrusted input.",
  "conclusion": "There are no apparent malicious indicators or suspicious behaviors in the provided code snippet. Due to incomplete information, the overall security risk cannot be conclusively determined, but current signals suggest low risk.",
