{
  "purpose": "Review open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on code analysis, data flows, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, external data sources, user inputs, or network connections.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file I/O, environment variable access, dynamic code execution (eval, exec), and data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into processing functions, possibly reaching sinks like network or file outputs, or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code snippets; no use of eval/exec with untrusted data; no backdoors or covert channels detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Data flows involve benign operations, and no suspicious behaviors such as network exfiltration, hardcoded credentials, or dynamic code execution are present. The code's structure and content align with benign utility scripts or standard data processing modules. The low malware score (0) and risk score (0.2) are justified given the lack of malicious indicators. Confidence in benign assessment is high (0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall security posture is low risk.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
