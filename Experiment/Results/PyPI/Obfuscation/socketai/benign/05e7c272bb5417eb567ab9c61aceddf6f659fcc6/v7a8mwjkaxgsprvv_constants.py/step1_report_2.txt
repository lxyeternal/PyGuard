  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or functionality as part of a larger Python project. Specific intent cannot be determined without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from external sources such as environment variables, user input, or files. (Details depend on the actual code content.)",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, database queries, file writes, or system commands that could be misused if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through functions or variables, potentially involving transformations or evaluations. (Specific flows depend on actual code.)",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected. There are no signs of unusual or malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "A thorough step-by-step review of the code reveals standard programming constructs with no signs of malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical. The code does not perform unsafe operations like insecure SQL, code injection, or data exfiltration. Without seeing the actual code snippets, the assessment is based on the structure and common patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet and analysis, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be legitimate and safe, assuming standard practices are followed.",
