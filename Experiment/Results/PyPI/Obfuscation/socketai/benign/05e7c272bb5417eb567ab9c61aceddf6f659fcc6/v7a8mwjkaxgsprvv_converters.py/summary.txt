  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a collection of data sanitization and conversion utilities with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent based on static analysis. The current scores are appropriate; a slight increase in malware score to around 0.2 could be considered due to obfuscation, but 0.1 remains reasonable. Overall, the code is benign, serving as a utility module, with obfuscation being the primary concern."
