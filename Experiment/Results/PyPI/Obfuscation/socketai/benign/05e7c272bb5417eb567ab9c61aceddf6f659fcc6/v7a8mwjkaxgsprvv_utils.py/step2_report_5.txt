  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is primarily a date calculation utility that adjusts for weekends and holidays in Norway.\n- It uses obfuscated variable names and suppresses import errors when importing 'holidays'.\n- There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, network activity, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or for obscurity, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Calculate minimum due date considering holidays/weekends.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; obfuscation is stylistic.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0.7\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues. The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar date calculation, considering holidays/weekends.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; obfuscation present.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher securityRisk (0.2) is acceptable given the obfuscation and optional import, but no actual malicious behavior. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.8, obfuscated=0.6\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower obfuscation score, but still reasonable. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9, obfuscated=0.8\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of all reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is for date calculation with holiday and weekend adjustments.\n- The obfuscation and suppressed imports are stylistic or for robustness, not malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling.\n- The security risk scores are appropriately low, given the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final evaluation and recommendations:**\n\n**Malware score:**  \nAll reports assign 0, which is correct. The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nScores are between 0.6 and 0.8, reflecting obfuscation but not malicious intent. This seems reasonable.\n\n**Risk score:**  \nMostly 0.2, reflecting some obfuscation and optional dependencies, but no actual security threat.\n\n**However, considering the overall picture:**\n- The obfuscation could be a red flag in some contexts, but here it appears benign.\n- The use of suppressed imports and dynamic variable names seems more stylistic than malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My final estimate:**\n\n| Score Type   | Final Justification                                              |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware      | **0** — No malicious activity detected.                          |\n| Obfuscated   | **0.7** — Obfuscation is present but not malicious.             |\n| Risk         | **0.2** — Slight obfuscation and optional dependencies, but no real security threat. |\n\n**Note:** If I were to assign a risk score higher than 0.5, I would need evidence of malicious intent or behavior, which is absent here.\n\n---\n\n## **Conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is a date utility with obfuscation but no malicious behavior. The assigned scores are reasonable. I agree with the assessments and would keep the scores as they are, perhaps slightly lowering obfuscated scores if clarity is preferred, but overall, the evaluation is sound.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Malware: **0**  \n- Obfuscated: **0.7**  \n- Risk: **0.2**",
