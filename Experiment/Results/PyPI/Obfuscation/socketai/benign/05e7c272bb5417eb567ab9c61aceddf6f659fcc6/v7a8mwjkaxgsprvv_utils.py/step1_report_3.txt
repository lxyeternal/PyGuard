{
  "purpose": "Calculate a minimum due date based on current date/time, holidays, and weekday adjustments.",
  "sources": "Reading current datetime object, importing timezone info, optional import of 'holidays' module.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions; no external output or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Input datetime -> holiday check (if available) -> holiday data affects days added -> weekday adjustment -> return adjusted date.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic import suppression, conditional import of 'holidays' (possibly optional or unreliable), usage of 'lOywNrQYzvTXJcRdzOgYqbWPmOHheUEs' method name which is non-standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious hardcoded URLs/credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code aims to compute a due date considering holidays and weekends, using timezone info. Variable names are obfuscated, but the logic appears straightforward and related to date calculations. The optional import of 'holidays' is wrapped in suppress, indicating it might be missing or optional; no malicious behavior from this. No code injection, external network calls (except optional and suppressed 'holidays' import), or data exfiltration observed. The obfuscation and suppression seem intended to hide or avoid errors rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs date calculations with optional holiday adjustments, with obfuscated variable names and suppressed imports. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity detected. The obfuscation appears to be a stylistic or protective measure rather than malicious intent.",
