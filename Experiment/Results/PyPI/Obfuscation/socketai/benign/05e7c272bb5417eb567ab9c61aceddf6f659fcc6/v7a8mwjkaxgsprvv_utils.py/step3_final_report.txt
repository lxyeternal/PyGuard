  "purpose": "Calculate minimum due date considering weekends and holidays in Norway.",
  "sources": "Current datetime input, optional 'holidays' library for holiday data.",
  "sinks": "Return of adjusted date; no data leaks or external data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Input 'now' -> holiday and weekend checks -> date adjustment -> output date.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, suppressed import of 'holidays', dynamic attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The code performs date calculations adjusting for weekends and holidays, using obfuscated variable names and optional 'holidays' library. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. Obfuscation appears stylistic, not malicious. The logic is straightforward and correct for its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign date calculation utility with stylistic obfuscation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the use of optional dependencies is standard. Scores of malware=0 and low security risk are appropriate; obfuscation is justified by variable naming style.",
