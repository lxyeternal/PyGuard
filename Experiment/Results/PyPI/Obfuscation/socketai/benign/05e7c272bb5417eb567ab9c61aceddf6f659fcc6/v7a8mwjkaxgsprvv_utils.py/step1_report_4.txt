{
  "purpose": "Calculate a minimum due date based on current date/time, holidays, and weekday adjustments.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'now' (datetime object), optional 'country_holidays' import (if available).",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; calculations involve date manipulations only.",
  "flows": "The function processes 'now' and possibly holiday data to determine a future date; no untrusted data flows outside the function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; dynamic import suppression; conditional holiday import which is not critical; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious network or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function to calculate a future date considering holidays and weekends, importing 'zoneinfo' for timezone info, with fallback. It uses dynamic variable names and obfuscation, but these are likely for obscurity rather than malicious intent. The holiday import is conditionally suppressed, and no network or file operations seem to be performed maliciously. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident beyond obfuscation. The code appears to perform standard date calculations with optional holiday adjustments, with no indications of malware or malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for date calculation with holiday and weekend adjustments, with obfuscation likely for code hiding. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected.",
