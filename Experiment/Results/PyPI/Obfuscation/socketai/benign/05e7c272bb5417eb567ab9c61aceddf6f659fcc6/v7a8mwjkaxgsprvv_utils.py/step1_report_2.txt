{
  "purpose": "Calculate the minimum due date based on the current datetime, considering holidays and weekends in Norway.",
  "sources": "Reading current datetime ('now'), importing modules 'zoneinfo' and 'holidays' (conditionally), accessing 'now.hour', 'now.weekday()', and holiday data for Norway.",
  "sinks": "Potentially using untrusted holiday data, but it is based on a known package 'holidays' for country holidays; no data leaks or injection points evident.",
  "flows": "Current datetime 'now' is used to determine holiday and weekend adjustments, then combined with timedelta to compute the due date.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and function names make the code harder to interpret. Use of 'suppress(ImportError)' to conditionally import 'holidays' is unusual but not malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code flows detected.",
  "analysis": "The code calculates a due date by adding days to the current date, considering holidays and weekends in Norway. It uses conditional import to include holiday data if available. The function adjusts the due date for weekends and upcoming holidays, which appears to be a legitimate date calculation. Obfuscation through variable naming does not imply malicious intent but reduces code clarity. No suspicious data flows, external network communications, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs legitimate date calculations for due date estimation, with obfuscation but no malicious intent. It does not contain malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The only concern is reduced clarity due to naming, but no security threats are identified.",
