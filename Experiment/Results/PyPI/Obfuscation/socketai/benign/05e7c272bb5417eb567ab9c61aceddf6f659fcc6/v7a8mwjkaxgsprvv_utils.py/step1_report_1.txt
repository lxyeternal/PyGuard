{
  "purpose": "Calculate a minimum due date based on the current date and holidays in Norway, considering weekends and holidays.",
  "sources": "Reads current datetime 'now', possibly imports from 'holidays' library, uses 'zoneinfo' for timezone info.",
  "sinks": "Uses 'now' input to compute future date; no untrusted data sinks identified; no data leaks or sensitive data handling present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'now', retrieves holiday data, computes future date based on weekends and holidays, returns adjusted date.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; dynamic import suppression; indirect use of 'holidays' library with import suppression; the code structure and variable naming are unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code determines a due date by adding days to 'now' based on the current weekday and holiday data for Norway. It imports 'zoneinfo' with fallback, and 'holidays' optionally, suppressing ImportError. The code calculates the offset 'tBEdXiPPAfgdTkotLIUIEPNaUCfQAVzC' based on whether 'now' is before 14:00. It adds holiday days and weekend adjustments. All operations are straightforward date calculations with no external data exfiltration or malicious actions. The obfuscation appears to be an intentional coding style, not malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a date calculation utility that considers weekends and holidays in Norway. It contains obfuscated variable names and suppressed import errors but no evidence of malicious intent or malware. No suspicious network or system behavior detected.",
