  "purpose": "Static enum definitions with obfuscated class and variable names, serving as internal constants or configuration values.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions, class names, and enum member assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data input, network activity, or data leakage points detected.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code is static definitions without data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and member names; duplicate enum values in one enum; no active code or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple enum class definitions with intentionally obfuscated names and values. No functions, data processing, or external data sources are present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or proprietary reasons, not malicious intent. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are evident. The duplicate enum value (21) in one enum is valid in Python but may suggest obfuscation or inconsistency. Overall, the code is static, benign, and likely used for internal constants. The high obfuscation scores are justified, and malware scores are appropriately zero. The minimal security risk score reflects the static, non-executable nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of heavily obfuscated enum definitions with no active malicious behavior or external data interactions. The obfuscation is notable but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is negligible, and the code appears benign, serving as internal constants or configuration parameters.",
