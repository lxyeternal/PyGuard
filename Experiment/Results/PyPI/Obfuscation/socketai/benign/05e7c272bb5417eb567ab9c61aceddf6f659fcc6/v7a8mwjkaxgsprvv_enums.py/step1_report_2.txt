{
  "purpose": "Defines several enumerations using IntEnum, likely for categorization or constants in a larger system.",
  "sources": "None of the enumerations read external input; no data sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or external communication present in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources or external systems; just internal constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and variable identifiers are non-descriptive, seemingly random strings. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscated code is present. No unusual behaviors or dynamic execution detected. No suspicious code patterns or embedded malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively contains enum class definitions with hardcoded integer values. Class and variable names appear intentionally obfuscated or autogenerated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no functions, input/output handling, or external calls. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious backdoors, or harmful logic. The absence of external communication or sensitive data handling reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to serve as a set of constants or configuration values with obfuscated naming, possibly to hinder easy understanding but without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of enum definitions with obfuscated names and no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It poses no security risk and appears benign, likely used for internal constant representation.",
