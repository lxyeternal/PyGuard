{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple enumeration classes with seemingly random and obfuscated names and values, likely for internal use in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Constant definitions within enum classes; no external data inputs observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs present; no network, file, or environment variable interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; all code is static enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated class and variable names, with no meaningful identifiers. No functional code, no comments, or documentation. The class and enum names appear intentionally obscured, which is unusual and suspicious for standard code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with random, nonsensical names and numeric values, some of which are duplicated or non-sequential. There are no functions, no input/output operations, and no interactions with external systems. The obfuscated naming pattern suggests an attempt to hide intent or functionality. No malicious code, such as network activity, file access, or credential handling, is evident. The structure is static and does not perform any actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated enum definitions with no active malicious behavior or security risks. Its primary purpose seems to be to conceal internal details or to serve as a code distraction. No malware or security threats are detected based solely on these definitions.",
