  "purpose": "Define several enumerations with seemingly arbitrary or obfuscated names and values.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and their constant assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; code does not perform data processing, input/output, or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only declares enums.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names, which could be a sign of code obfuscation or malicious intent. No clear logic or data processing present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious strings. No dynamic execution or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with obscure names and values. No functions, input handling, or output operations are present. The obfuscated naming pattern may be intended to hide intent or to complicate reverse engineering. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code appears benign but may be intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious in certain contexts. Overall, it lacks malicious behavior but could be part of a larger obfuscated package.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks by itself. Its obfuscated style warrants caution, but it appears to only define enums with no active malicious functions or data leaks. Confidence in malicious intent is low; the primary concern is obfuscation rather than malicious activity.",
