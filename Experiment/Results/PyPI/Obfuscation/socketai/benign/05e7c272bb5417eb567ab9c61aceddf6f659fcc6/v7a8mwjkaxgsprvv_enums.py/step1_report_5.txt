{
  "purpose": "The code defines several Enum classes with obfuscated class and member names, likely intended for use as constants in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The source is the module's own class definitions, which are static and do not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows where untrusted data is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks are present; the code only contains static Enum definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class and member names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious logic are present. The code appears to be straightforward enum declarations with no dynamic execution or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with obfuscated names, which may be an attempt to hide their purpose. No input sources, external data processing, or network operations are included. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors. The obfuscation is superficial, not indicative of malicious intent, but possibly for code concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated enum definitions without malicious intent. No malware or security risks are evident. The only notable aspect is the obfuscation of names, which might be for proprietary reasons rather than malicious purposes.",
