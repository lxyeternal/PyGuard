  "purpose": "Classes defining regex-based parsers for fixed-format financial transaction records, used for data validation and extraction.",
  "sources": "Regex pattern matching within class methods, class attributes defining patterns, and input lines to be matched against these patterns.",
  "sinks": "None; the code performs pattern matching and data validation without executing untrusted code or performing data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input line -> regex pattern match -> class instantiation with captured groups -> data processing or validation.",
  "anomalies": "The regex patterns are extensive and complex, but this is typical for fixed-format data parsing; no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines data classes with regex patterns for parsing structured financial records. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The regex patterns are complex but serve legitimate purposes. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are found. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. The potential for regex ReDoS exists but is not evidenced here. Overall, the code is a standard, well-structured parser with no security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, non-malicious parser for fixed-format financial transaction records. No indicators of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained.",
