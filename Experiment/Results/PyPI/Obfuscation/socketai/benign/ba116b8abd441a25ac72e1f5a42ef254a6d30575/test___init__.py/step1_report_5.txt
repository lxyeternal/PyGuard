  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for general data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose discernible from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from local variables, function parameters, and possibly environment variables or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if present, but no explicit dangerous sinks are detected in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (such as user input or environment variables) through functions and possibly to output or storage mechanisms, but no specific malicious flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are observed. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is examined for typical security issues including code injection, data leaks, or malicious behavior. No suspicious imports, dynamic execution, or hidden network activities are evident. The structure is clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Absence of any hardcoded secrets or unsafe practices suggests this is benign, but the analysis is limited to the visible snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and safe, with no malicious anomalies detected. Confidence in this conclusion is high given the lack of suspicious features.",
