  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution but lacks evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The low malware score is appropriate, and the overall security risk remains low to moderate. The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses, indicating no immediate threat but suggesting ongoing vigilance for obfuscated or dynamically executed code."
