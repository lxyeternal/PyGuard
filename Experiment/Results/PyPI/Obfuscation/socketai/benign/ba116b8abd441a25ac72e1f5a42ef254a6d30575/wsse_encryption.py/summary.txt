  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a legitimate implementation of XML encryption and certificate handling routines. It shows no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior. The cryptographic operations are standard and correctly applied. The overall security risk is low, primarily dependent on secure input handling and validation. The existing report scores are appropriate and align with the detailed analysis."
