      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscation and suspicious dependency notation but no active malicious behavior. The anomalies should be investigated further, especially the dependency string and source integrity, before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution but lacks evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The low malware score is appropriate, and the overall security risk remains low to moderate. The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses, indicating no immediate threat but suggesting ongoing vigilance for obfuscated or dynamically executed code."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate cryptographic message processing with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The low malware score is appropriate, but the moderate risk score reflects the need for further verification of the imported modules and their functions. Continuous monitoring and source validation are recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate implementation of XML digital signature handling, with obfuscation that reduces clarity but does not suggest malicious intent. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads is present. The low security risk score is appropriate, assuming proper input validation and secure key management. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not alone indicate malicious activity."

The cryptographic operations are standard and correctly applied. The overall security risk is low, primarily dependent on secure input handling and validation. The existing report scores are appropriate and align with the detailed analysis."

The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security assessment is low risk, and no changes are necessary."
