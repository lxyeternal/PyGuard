  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform legitimate cryptographic message processing with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The low malware score is appropriate, but the moderate risk score reflects the need for further verification of the imported modules and their functions. Continuous monitoring and source validation are recommended."
