{
  "purpose": "Assign a version number or a string value to a variable, possibly for configuration or version control.",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string '0.1' to the variable 'OoDFFLvMmGFDENUgwcsRGhboKnYDosCG'.",
  "sinks": "The code only involves a variable assignment; no sinks such as network, file, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "N/A – no flow beyond variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears as a random string, which might suggest obfuscation or code hiding. The value is a simple version string, which is common. No other unusual code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '0.1' to a variable with a nonsensical name. There are no functions, data flows, or external interactions. The code is minimal and does not exhibit any behavior associated with malicious activity. The obfuscated variable name could be for code hiding, but with only this line, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name, likely for configuration purposes. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
