  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow involving external input or output",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be a random or obfuscated string; no clear semantic meaning, and the class is an exception class with no additional logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single class that inherits from Exception, with a non-descriptive, seemingly random name. There are no methods, no data processing, and no external interactions. The class does not contain malicious code or behavior; it is simply a placeholder for an exception.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The class is likely used as a custom error type in a larger codebase.",
