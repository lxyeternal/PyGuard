  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named HxCrUOyLFhVPzldoyStoBZxlwBVsmiEq.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations that could leak data or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flow as the code only declares a class without any executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears intentionally obfuscated, which can be suspicious. The class contains no additional logic or attributes, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single custom exception class with an obfuscated name, inheriting from Python's Exception class. No data input, no external dependencies, and no behavior are present. The obfuscated class name could be an attempt to hide purpose or simply be a placeholder. There are no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious logic. The code is minimal and does not perform any operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There are no indications of malicious intent, security risks, or malicious behavior within this fragment. The obfuscated name could be benign or part of a larger context, but based solely on this snippet, it appears harmless.",
