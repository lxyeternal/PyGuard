  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition, likely used for specialized error handling within a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks as no input or processing code exists here.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is a seemingly random or obfuscated string, which could indicate intentional obfuscation or attempt to hide purpose; however, it is only a class definition with no functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with an obscure, non-descriptive name. There are no data inputs, outputs, or behaviors that suggest malicious activity. The lack of methods or logic minimizes risk, though the class name's randomness is unusual. Overall, the code appears benign but suspicious if taken out of context due to obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, harmless class definition with an obfuscated name. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment, though the naming convention is atypical and may warrant further review in the broader codebase.",
