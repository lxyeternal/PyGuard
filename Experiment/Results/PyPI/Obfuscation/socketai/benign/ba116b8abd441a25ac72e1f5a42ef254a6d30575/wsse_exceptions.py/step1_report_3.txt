  "sinks": "No data output, no untrusted data handling or processing",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears as a nonsensical string, possibly obfuscated, but no malicious behavior detected; no other suspicious code features",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with a randomized name that inherits from Python's built-in Exception. The class contains no additional methods, attributes, or behavior. The class name does not resemble meaningful or malicious code; it appears as a random or obfuscated string. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious actions are present. The code is minimal and standard in structure, with no signs of obfuscation or malware. The random class name might be used for obfuscation or evasion, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward definition of a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign, likely used as a placeholder or for obfuscation purposes without malicious intent.",
