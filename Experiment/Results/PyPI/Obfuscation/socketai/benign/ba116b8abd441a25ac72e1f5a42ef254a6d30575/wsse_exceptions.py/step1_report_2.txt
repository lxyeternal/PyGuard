  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition for error handling.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows between sources and sinks, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be an obfuscated or randomly generated string; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with an obfuscated name, inheriting from the built-in Exception. There are no input sources, data handling, or logic that could indicate malicious activity. The obfuscated class name might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but without additional code, it remains benign. No suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated-named custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation of the class name alone is not sufficient to conclude malicious intent.",
