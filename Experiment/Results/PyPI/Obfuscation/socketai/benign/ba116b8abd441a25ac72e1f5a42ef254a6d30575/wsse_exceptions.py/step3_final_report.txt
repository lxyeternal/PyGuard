{
  "purpose": "A custom exception class with an obfuscated name, likely used for error handling or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "No data sources; class definition does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a simple placeholder without logic.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no methods or attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an empty class inheriting from Exception with an obfuscated name. No data sources, sinks, or flows are present. No malicious code, network activity, or data leakage is detected. The obfuscated name may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is correctly zero; the obfuscation score is high (0.8) due to the name; the security risk is minimal (0.1), reflecting cautious acknowledgment of obfuscation but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated-named custom exception class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent but warrants cautious review in broader contexts.",
