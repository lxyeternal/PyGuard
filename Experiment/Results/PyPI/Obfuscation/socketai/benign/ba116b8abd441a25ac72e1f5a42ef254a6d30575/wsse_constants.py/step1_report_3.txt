{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple XML namespace URLs related to SOAP, XML Digital Signatures, XML Encryption, and WS-Security standards, likely for constructing or processing security-related XML messages.",
  "sources": "Constants are assigned string URLs; no external input reading or data ingestion observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or sensitive operations identified; no data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only sets string constants.",
  "anomalies": "All URLs are hardcoded as static strings, typical for namespace definitions; no obfuscation or unusual code structures. No suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of string assignments defining XML namespace URLs used in security and SOAP messaging. No data input, user interaction, network operations, or executable logic. The presence of such constants is standard in security protocol implementations and does not indicate malicious intent. No anomalies, such as encoded or obfuscated code, are present. The code appears to serve as configuration or reference data for a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the content, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code functions as standard namespace definitions for XML-based security protocols. No suspicious activity or malicious intent detected.",
