  "purpose": "Define namespace URIs for XML and web security standards used in SOAP messaging and WS-Security protocols.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string variables representing namespace URLs, which are not based on external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in this code snippet.",
  "flows": "N/A — no data flow from sources to sinks is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior; variables are straightforward namespace URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string values to variables, representing well-known XML namespace URIs for SOAP, WS-Security, and related standards. There are no input or data processing operations, no dynamic code execution, nor any obfuscated or hidden code segments. This appears to be configuration or namespace setup for a larger SOAP/WS-Security implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and appears to be part of a standard security or messaging configuration. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors in this fragment.",
