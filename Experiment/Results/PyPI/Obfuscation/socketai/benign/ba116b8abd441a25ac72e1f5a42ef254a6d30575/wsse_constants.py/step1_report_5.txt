{
  "purpose": "Define XML namespace URIs related to SOAP, XML Digital Signature, XML Encryption, and WS-Security standards.",
  "sources": "String literals assigned to variables, representing namespace URIs.",
  "sinks": "None; no data is read from external sources, nor is there any data being sent or used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only contains static string assignments.",
  "anomalies": "The variables are assigned static strings that appear to be standard namespace URLs; no suspicious or obfuscated code present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of variable assignments of well-known namespace URLs used in XML and SOAP security contexts. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no sinks. No dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no malicious patterns observed. The code appears to be configuration or constants for a larger security or SOAP-related module.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines URI strings for XML security standards and does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It is standard namespace declaration code with no signs of tampering or malicious intent.",
