  "purpose": "Define XML namespace URLs and schema locations related to web security standards.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned with string URLs, likely used as namespace identifiers or schema locations.",
  "markets": "None of the sources involve user input or external data fetching; they are static string assignments.",
  "flows": "None present, as there are only string assignments without data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, unusual code, or obfuscated code. All strings are standard namespace URLs related to XML security standards.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments of static URL strings related to XML security namespaces and schemas. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external network calls, nor any code execution. The constants seem to be used for XML message construction or validation purposes. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are identified. The code appears benign and standard for XML security handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of namespace URLs for XML security standards, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
