  "purpose": "Define XML namespace URIs and schema locations related to SOAP, WS-Security, and XML encryption standards.",
  "sources": "Constants assigned to string literals representing namespace URLs and schema locations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks detected; no untrusted data processed or output generated.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; all are static string assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of string constant assignments; no anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns predefined URL strings related to XML schemas, WS-Security, and encryption standards. There are no inputs, network calls, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded credentials, no data leakage, and no malicious payloads detected. All code appears to be configuration or namespace declarations, typical for SOAP/XML security configurations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as namespace definitions for XML security standards. No malicious or suspicious behavior identified.",
