  "purpose": "Define XML namespace URLs related to SOAP, WS-Security, XML Digital Signature, and XML Encryption standards for use in XML security configurations.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments of well-known namespace URLs within the code.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any actions that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only assigns static string values to variables.",
  "anomalies": "None; the code consists solely of static, well-known namespace URL strings with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only static string assignments of standard namespace URLs used in SOAP and WS-Security contexts. There are no inputs, network calls, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation. All variables are straightforward and contain well-known, static URLs. The absence of data flows, sinks, or malicious code indicates a benign configuration snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0, obfuscated: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent with the code's static and standard nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present, and the code does not pose any security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of namespace URL declarations used for XML security configurations. It contains no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications to the scores or conclusions are necessary.",
