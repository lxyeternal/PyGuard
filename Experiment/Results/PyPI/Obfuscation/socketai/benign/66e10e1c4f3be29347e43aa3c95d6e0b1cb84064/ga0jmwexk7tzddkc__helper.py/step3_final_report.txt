{
  "purpose": "These functions generate command-line argument lists based on optional parameters, likely for subprocess invocation or CLI construction.",
  "sources": "Function parameters 'wait' and 'fields' which may accept external input.",
  "sinks": "The generated argument lists could be passed to subprocesses or external commands, but on their own, they do not cause harm.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> function logic -> argument list -> potential subprocess call (not shown here).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names; no actual malicious code, data leaks, or system modifications present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two simple utility functions that generate argument lists based on optional inputs. No external data access, network activity, or code execution occurs within these functions. The obfuscated names could raise suspicion but do not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The obfuscation scores vary but are justified by the nonsensical names. The overall analysis confirms no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for argument construction. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores across reports are appropriate, with a slight adjustment to obfuscation score (~0.4) to reflect the obfuscated names without overestimating risk.",
