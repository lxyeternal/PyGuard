  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions for argument construction. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores across reports are appropriate, with a slight adjustment to obfuscation score (~0.4) to reflect the obfuscated names without overestimating risk."
