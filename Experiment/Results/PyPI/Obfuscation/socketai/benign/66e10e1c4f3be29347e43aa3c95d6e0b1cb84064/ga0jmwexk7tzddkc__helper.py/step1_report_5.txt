  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to generate command-line argument lists based on optional input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'wait' and 'fields' passed to the functions.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that produce lists of strings; these could be used as command-line arguments.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> Conditional logic -> Return of argument lists.",
  "anomalies": "Functions use obfuscated names and have no documentation, which could obscure intent. No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data are present. No dynamic code execution, network access, or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The functions 'szeqjIgwGVUjLeGjVsYmeBdcantPxXLP' and 'rcpTERgwEqQFgIFEREQljLJklvCpffTO' accept optional parameters. They return empty lists if parameters are None, or lists with specific flags and parameter values otherwise. The naming is intentionally obfuscated, but the logic appears straightforward for generating command-line arguments. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or malicious behaviors such as network access or file operations are present. The code is minimal and structurally simple, with no external dependencies or code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for creating command-line argument lists based on input parameters. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation indicators are present. The obfuscated function names may be intended to conceal their purpose but do not suggest malicious intent.",
