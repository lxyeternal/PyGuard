{
  "purpose": "The code defines two utility functions to generate command-line argument lists based on optional input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'wait' and 'fields' received from function calls.",
  "sinks": "The generated lists may be used as command-line arguments, potentially passed to subprocess calls or similar.",
  "flows": "Function parameters -> list construction -> returned list for command execution.",
  "anomalies": "The functions generate argument lists dynamically; no suspicious or malicious code such as network calls, file access, or data exfiltration is present. No hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of simple functions that take optional parameters and return corresponding argument lists. There are no inputs from external sources such as environment variables, files, or network. The functions do not perform any dangerous actions or contain hidden behaviors. The code appears to be utility functions for command-line argument construction, which is common in scripting. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for constructing command argument lists with optional parameters. It poses no security threats or malicious behavior risks based on the provided code.",
