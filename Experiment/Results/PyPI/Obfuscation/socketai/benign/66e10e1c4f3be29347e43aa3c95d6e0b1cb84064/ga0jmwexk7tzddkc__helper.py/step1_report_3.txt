{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions that generate command-line argument lists based on optional input parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'wait' and 'fields' which are used to determine return values.",
  "sinks": "The functions return lists that could potentially be used as command-line arguments, but there are no direct sinks that execute or transmit untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are checked for None; if not None, they are converted to strings and included in argument lists.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious commands, or unusual code structures are present. The functions are simple and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that return specific argument lists depending on the provided parameters. There are no operations that read external data sources, no command execution, and no data leaks. The functions appear to be utility helpers for constructing command-line arguments. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or malware are evident. The code is minimal and standard in structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, simple utility functions for command-line argument preparation. No malicious behavior or security risks are identified.",
