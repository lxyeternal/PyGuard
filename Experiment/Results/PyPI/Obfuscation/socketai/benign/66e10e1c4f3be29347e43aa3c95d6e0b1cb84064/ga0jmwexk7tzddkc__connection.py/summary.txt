  "conclusion": "The code does not contain explicit malware or backdoors but exhibits patterns—dynamic command execution with unvalidated inputs, obfuscated naming—that pose security risks, primarily command injection. The high obfuscation and potential for misuse justify elevated risk and malware scores. Proper input sanitization and validation are recommended to mitigate these risks."
