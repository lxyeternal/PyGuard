  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, obfuscated system management utility for radio interfaces, with no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The main concern is the obfuscation and system control functions, which could be exploited if misused, but the current code does not exhibit malicious activity. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood, high obfuscation, and moderate security risk."
