  "purpose": "Define two enumerations representing various status states with descriptive string labels.",
  "sources": "Enumeration class definitions with string assignments for each enum member.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data input/output, no network or file operations, and no external data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sensitive sinks; the code solely declares enum classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class names and variable identifiers; no sensitive data handling or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two enum classes with seemingly random, obfuscated names and members assigned descriptive string values. No input handling, data processing, or external communication occurs. The structure appears to be just data definitions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. The obfuscated identifiers may suggest an attempt to hide intent or simply be a stylistic choice. Overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward enumeration definition with obfuscated class and member names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The code appears safe and intended for internal status representation.",
