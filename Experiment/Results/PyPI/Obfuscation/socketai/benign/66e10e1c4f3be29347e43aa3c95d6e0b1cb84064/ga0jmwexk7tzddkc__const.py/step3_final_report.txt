  "purpose": "Defines two enum classes representing connection and status states with obfuscated class and member names.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions with string values assigned to obfuscated member names.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "Static enum definitions; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and member names; no malicious code or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum classes with obfuscated identifiers, serving as internal state representations. No external data handling, network activity, or executable logic is present. The obfuscation could be stylistic or concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the static nature, obfuscation, and absence of malicious payloads. Malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the static, benign code. Risk scores are low, justified by the obfuscation but no active threats. Confidence levels are high, given the static analysis. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or data leakage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static enum definitions with obfuscated naming. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate, and the code can be considered safe in isolation.",
