{
  "purpose": "Defines two enumeration classes with various string constants representing different states or statuses.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions with string assignments for each member.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed; static enum definitions contain no data flow.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; enums are static mappings without dynamic or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and member names appear obfuscated or randomly generated; no clear purpose or documentation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with string values assigned to members. No input, output, or external data handling is present. Names are obfuscated, which may suggest code hiding or just non-descriptive naming. There are no functions, network operations, or data manipulation. The code appears to be static enum declarations with no malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static enum definitions with obfuscated naming, which does not exhibit malicious behavior. No indicators of malware, data leakage, or malicious logic are present.",
