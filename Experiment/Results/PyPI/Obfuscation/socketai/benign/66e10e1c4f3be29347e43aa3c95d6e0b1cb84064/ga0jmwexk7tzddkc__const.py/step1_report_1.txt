  "purpose": "Define two enumerations representing different connection states or modes.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; static enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data flow or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static enums used internally.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical or obfuscated class and member names; no obvious malicious intent but suggestive of obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two classes inheriting from Enum, each defining several string-valued members with obscure, non-descriptive names. There is no data input, no network or file I/O, and no suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration or command execution. The naming pattern appears intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose or make reverse engineering more difficult. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident. The code appears solely to define enums, possibly for internal use, but the naming scheme is suspicious and warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on its static enum definitions. However, the obfuscated class and member names could indicate an attempt to hide functionality, which warrants caution if integrated into larger projects. Overall, low likelihood of malicious intent but potential obfuscation concern.",
