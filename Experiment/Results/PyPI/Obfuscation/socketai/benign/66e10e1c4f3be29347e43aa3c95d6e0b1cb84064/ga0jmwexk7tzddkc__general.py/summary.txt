  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated system info utility with potential for misuse due to external command execution and high obfuscation. No direct evidence of malicious payloads is present, but the suspicious structure and external interactions justify moderate concern. Further investigation into the external method's implementation is recommended to confirm safety."
