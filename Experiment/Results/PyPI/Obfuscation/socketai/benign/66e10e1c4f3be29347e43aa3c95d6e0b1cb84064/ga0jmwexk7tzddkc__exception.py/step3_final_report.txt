  "purpose": "Obfuscated exception class definitions with static string attributes, likely for concealment or namespace purposes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with static string attributes, no input or external data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or active logic; static attribute assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names, static strings that appear random, no functional code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple obfuscated exception classes with static string attributes. There is no logic, data flow, network activity, or external data handling. The obfuscation suggests an intent to conceal, but without active malicious code, this pattern is benign. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.0, obfuscated 0.9, security risk 0.2) are consistent with the code's nature. The absence of active malicious behavior and the static nature of the code support a benign interpretation, though obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring in a broader context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated class definitions with static strings, likely for concealment. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the low malware and risk scores are appropriate given the lack of active malicious behavior.",
