  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No, the code only defines obfuscated exception classes with static attributes.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The report correctly notes obfuscation and lack of active logic. No operational code or data flow is detected.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.0 — appropriate, no malicious activity observed.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — reasonable given obfuscation but no active threat.\n  - Obfuscated: 0.9 — aligns with obfuscated class/attribute names.\n- **Conclusion:** The code appears benign; no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No, similar pattern—obfuscated exception classes with static strings.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The report correctly highlights suspicion due to obfuscation but notes no active malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.2 — slightly elevated, considering obfuscation could conceal malicious intent, which is reasonable.\n  - Risk: 0.4 — higher, reflecting potential concealment.\n- **Conclusion:** Suspicious but no direct evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No, again, only class definitions with obfuscated strings.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The analysis correctly states no active malicious behavior, only obfuscation.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.1 — appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, mainly obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No, similar pattern.\n- **Errors or flaws?** Correctly notes absence of active malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0.0 — appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0.1 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No threat detected.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No, consistent with previous findings.\n- **Errors or flaws?** Correctly identifies obfuscation without active malicious code.\n- **Scores:**\n  - Malware: 0 — appropriate.\n  - Risk: 0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports align with the fact that the code contains only obfuscated class definitions with static attributes and no active malicious operations. The malware scores are appropriately low, with some cautious increases due to obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High across all reports, as expected.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly varies but remains low overall, reflecting that obfuscation alone isn't necessarily malicious but warrants caution.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not exhibit any signs of active malware, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification.\n- Obfuscation is present but could be benign or used for concealment.\n- Without further context or operational code, the risk remains minimal.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — consistent with the current analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.9 — the obfuscation is evident and deliberate.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low but not negligible; obfuscation can be a red flag, but no active threat is present.\n\n**Summary:** The code appears to be purely definitional with obfuscated exception classes and static attributes. No malicious activity is detectable within this snippet, but obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring in the broader context.",
