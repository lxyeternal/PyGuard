  "conclusion": "The script is a benign setup routine with obfuscated variable names and an unusual command-line enforcement. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation and control flow are suspicious but not malicious. The scores should reflect no malware, moderate obfuscation, and low security risk."
