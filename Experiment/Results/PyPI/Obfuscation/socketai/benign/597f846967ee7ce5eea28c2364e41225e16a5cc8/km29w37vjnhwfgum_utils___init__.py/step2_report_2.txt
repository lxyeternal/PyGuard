  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the consistency of scores, and evaluate the presence of malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Code presence:** No code provided; only a high-level analysis.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no anomalies, malware, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.6.\n- **Assessment:** Given the lack of code, the low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate. The security risk is low, but moderate confidence is reasonable due to limited information.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Code presence:** Minimal code, no explicit malicious patterns.\n- **Findings:** No hardcoded secrets, suspicious functions, or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.6.\n- **Assessment:** The low malware and obfuscated scores are justified. The confidence level is moderate, consistent with the limited code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Code presence:** No explicit malicious activity; appears benign.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.7.\n- **Assessment:** The scores align with the benign analysis; confidence is slightly higher due to a clearer benign pattern.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Code presence:** No code provided.\n- **Findings:** Cannot analyze code; no activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.\n- **Assessment:** Perfectly appropriate; no code means no risk.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Code presence:** No code, only general analysis.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious activity or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Given the absence of code, the low risk and obfuscation scores are appropriate; high confidence is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n- All reports correctly assign zero malware and obfuscation scores given the lack of code or benign code.\n- The securityRisk scores are low (0.2), which is reasonable for code that shows no suspicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting the limited but consistent analysis.\n\n### Final estimation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low risk, no malicious activity, but some uncertainty due to limited info)\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores across all reports are consistent and appropriate based on the provided information. No adjustments are necessary.",
