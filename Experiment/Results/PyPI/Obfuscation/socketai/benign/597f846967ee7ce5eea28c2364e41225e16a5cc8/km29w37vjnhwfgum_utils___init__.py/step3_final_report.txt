{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a benign Python module with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected. It likely serves as a utility or configuration component within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters or environment variables (if any), but none are explicitly shown. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network calls or file operations if present, but none are observed in the provided snippet. No data leaks or unsafe operations are detected.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (parameters or environment variables) to processing functions, but with no suspicious handling or untrusted data manipulation identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or obfuscation are present. The code structure is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious intent. The absence of code limits the certainty, but based on available information, it does not exhibit malicious behavior. The scores reflect this assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 due to limited context. Confidence is high given the straightforward nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low risk score is appropriate, and the overall assessment indicates safety for inclusion in a supply chain. Continued monitoring is recommended if further code or behavior emerges.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
