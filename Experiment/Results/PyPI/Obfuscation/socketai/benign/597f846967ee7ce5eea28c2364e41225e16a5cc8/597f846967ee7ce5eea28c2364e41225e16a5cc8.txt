The scores are appropriate, with high obfuscation and low malware likelihood. Additional inspection of the module and symbol behavior is advised before making definitive security assessments."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for Redis job queue management, with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming complexity, but the overall behavior is consistent with standard queue management. No malware or malicious activity is detected. The main concern is the obfuscation and error handling practices, which should be reviewed if deployed in sensitive environments."
