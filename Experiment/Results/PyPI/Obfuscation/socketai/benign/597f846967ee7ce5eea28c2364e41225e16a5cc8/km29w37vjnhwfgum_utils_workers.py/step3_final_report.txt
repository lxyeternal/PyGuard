  "purpose": "Utility functions for retrieving and formatting worker information from Redis and RQ.",
  "sources": "Reads data from Redis connection, fetches worker objects, and processes job and queue details.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Fetch Redis connection -> Retrieve worker objects -> Access current jobs and queue info -> Format into JSON structures.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; broad exception handling that masks specific errors; no input validation or secrets found.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts solely with Redis and RQ worker objects, extracting worker status and job info. Obfuscated naming reduces readability but does not indicate malicious intent. Exception handling is broad, which could hide bugs but is common in utility code. No external network activity or payloads are present. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for monitoring RQ workers, with obfuscation as the main concern but no evidence of malicious activity. Malware score is appropriately zero; obfuscation is high but not malicious; overall security risk is low.",
