  "purpose": "Import a module or object named 'kkIIxjHmjEMXATuSMbStfvOYvQbCnUfp' from a local package or module 'rq_dashboard_fast'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a local module 'rq_dashboard_fast'.",
  "sinks": "The imported object 'kkIIxjHmjEMXATuSMbStfvOYvQbCnUfp' may be used later in the code; no direct sink in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement reads module; potential use of 'kkIIxjHmjEMXATuSMbStfvOYvQbCnUfp' later in the code would be a source-to-sink flow, but not visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object has an obfuscated or random-looking name, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing a symbol with an obfuscated or random name from a relative module 'rq_dashboard_fast'. The filename suggests it might be part of a dashboard component. The obfuscated symbol name could be an attempt to hide its purpose, but it is not inherently malicious. No other suspicious or malicious code, such as network activity, data leaks, or backdoors, is present in this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an obfuscated symbol name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The obfuscated name could be for legitimate reasons or for concealment, but without additional context, it is not suspicious.",
