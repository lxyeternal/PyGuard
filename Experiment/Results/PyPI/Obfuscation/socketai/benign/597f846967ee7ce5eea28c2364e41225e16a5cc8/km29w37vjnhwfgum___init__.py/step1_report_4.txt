  "purpose": "Import a module or object named 'kkIIxjHmjEMXATuSMbStfvOYvQbCnUfp' from a local package 'rq_dashboard_fast'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads the specified object from the module, but no data flow analysis beyond import exists.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object name 'kkIIxjHmjEMXATuSMbStfvOYvQbCnUfp' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be suspicious. No other code present to evaluate for malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing a specific object or module from a relative module. The object name is unusually long and nonsensical, which could suggest obfuscation or attempt to hide malicious intent. There is no evidence of malicious actions such as network connections, data leakage, or malicious code execution. No other code is present to analyze further. Without additional context, the purpose seems to be to load a specific component, but the naming raises suspicion of obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal import statement with an obfuscated name. While obfuscation can be benign, it often warrants caution. There is no clear malicious behavior in the provided code, but the unusual naming could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate the code's true purpose.",
