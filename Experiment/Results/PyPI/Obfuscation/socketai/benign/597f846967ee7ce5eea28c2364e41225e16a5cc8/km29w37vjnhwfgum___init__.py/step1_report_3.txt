  "purpose": "Importing a specific object or module from a relative module named 'rq_dashboard_fast'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module within the package.",
  "sinks": "Potentially none, as this is a straightforward import; however, if the imported object executes code upon import, it could be a concern.",
  "flows": "The imported object (kkIIxjHmjEMXATuSMbStfvOYvQbCnUfp) may execute or be used later, but no further flow is visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object has an obfuscated name, which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement from a relative module. The imported object has an unusual, seemingly random name, which is often a sign of obfuscation or malicious intent. Without seeing the implementation of 'kkIIxjHmjEMXATuSMbStfvOYvQbCnUfp', it is impossible to determine if it contains malicious code or performs unsafe actions. The code itself does not perform any operations beyond importing this object. The suspicious nature arises solely from the obfuscated import name and lack of context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to be designed to import an obfuscated object, which could potentially hide malicious behavior. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscated naming warrants caution, as it may be used for malicious purposes elsewhere in the module. Overall, the risk is low but the obfuscation increases suspicion.",
