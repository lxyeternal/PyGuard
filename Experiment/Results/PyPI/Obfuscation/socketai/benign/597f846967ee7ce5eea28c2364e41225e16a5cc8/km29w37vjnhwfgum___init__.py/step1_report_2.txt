  "purpose": "Import a module or object named 'kkIIxjHmjEMXATuSMbStfvOYvQbCnUfp' from a local module 'rq_dashboard_fast'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading a specific object from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the imported object if it executes code or causes side effects, but the code itself is just an import.",
  "flows": "Import statement retrieves the object; any execution or behavior depends on the imported module.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'kkIIxjHmjEMXATuSMbStfvOYvQbCnUfp' appears as a random string, which is suspicious and might be obfuscated or malicious. The import path is relative, but no other code is provided to analyze further.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement. The module name is relative ('from .rq_dashboard_fast'), indicating local import. The imported object has a non-meaningful, obfuscated-looking name, which is often used to hide malicious intent or obfuscate code. No other logic, data flows, or data sources are present. The actual behavior depends entirely on the content of the 'rq_dashboard_fast' module and the imported object. Since the import could potentially execute code upon import if the module does so, there is a minor risk, especially given the obfuscated name. However, without further context, this code alone is not inherently malicious but warrants caution due to the suspicious naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple local import of an object with an obfuscated name, which raises suspicion. The overall risk cannot be conclusively determined from this snippet alone, but the obfuscated import name is a potential indicator of malicious or concealed behavior. Further inspection of the 'rq_dashboard_fast' module is recommended.",
