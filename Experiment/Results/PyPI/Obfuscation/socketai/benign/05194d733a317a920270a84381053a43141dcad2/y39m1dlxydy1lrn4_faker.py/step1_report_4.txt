  "purpose": "Process multilingual data and determine language support based on stack context and settings.",
  "sources": "stack.stack[-3].qskiKgKVNRaqsQgtRPDeOfWDvFEslAmL, stack.stack[-2].qskiKgKVNRaqsQgtRPDeOfWDvFEslAmL, stack.stack[-1]['multilingual'], environment variables from settings.",
  "targets": "random.choice() selecting language from supported languages, accessing attributes and dictionary keys, and returning SKIP as fallback.",
  "flows": "Data read from stack to determine language type and multilingual info, then possibly selecting a language using random.choice based on supported languages.",
  "anomalies": "Use of try-except without specific exception handling, dynamic attribute access, and potential reliance on external data without validation. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious external calls observed.",
  "analysis": "The code examines elements from a stack to determine the language type. It retrieves multilingual info if available and compares current language context. If conditions are met, it randomly selects a language key from supported languages; otherwise, it returns SKIP. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious external communications are evident. The use of random.choice is benign here, used for selection, not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a conditional language selection based on context, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It’s a typical data processing routine with normal use of exception handling and attribute access.",
