  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is a standard setup script.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None identified.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0 — reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or suspicious behavior. The high confidence score is justified.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Same as above, standard minimal setup.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. Again, a typical boilerplate setup script.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0 — justified.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious behavior.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The code is minimal and standard.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0 — appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues Present?** No. The description mentions potential internal reading of metadata, but nothing suspicious is explicitly visible.\n- **Errors/Flaws?** The report suggests potential system directory writes during installation, but this is typical for setup scripts and not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, obfuscated=0 — consistent.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious behavior; the setup process is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Content:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a minimal, standard setup script.\n- **Malware & Obfuscated Scores:** All are zero, which aligns with the benign nature.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are zero, justified by the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Should stay at 0, as there's no indication of security issues.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- No modifications needed; the code is straightforward and safe.\n- The high confidence scores are justified given the clear, benign nature of the code.\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code snippets are standard package setup scripts with no malicious or suspicious activity. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
