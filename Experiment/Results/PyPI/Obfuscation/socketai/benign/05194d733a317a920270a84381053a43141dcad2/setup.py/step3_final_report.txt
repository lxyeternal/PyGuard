  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for Python package distribution using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import of setuptools module; invocation of setup() function.",
  "sinks": "No data sources or sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; setup() is called with no parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of arguments in setup(), no metadata or configuration provided, but this is standard for minimal setup.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, minimal invocation of setuptools.setup() with no arguments. It does not read input, handle environment variables, or perform any network or file operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident. The code is typical for a basic package setup script, and the lack of parameters suggests a placeholder or minimal configuration. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads. The code's simplicity and standard pattern support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard minimal setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. All signals indicate a safe package configuration, and the scores should reflect this.",
