  "purpose": "This code is intended to define and run the setup process for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or data; it simply imports a library and calls a function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code only executes a straightforward import and function call.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for package setup; no unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' library and calls its setup() function, which is a common pattern in Python packaging. There are no embedded or obfuscated code, no external data inputs, and no suspicious operations. It appears to be a boilerplate setup script without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for Python package setup, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
