  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leakage points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the script simply calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The script is minimalistic and only invokes setup() without additional parameters or custom code. No suspicious or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls the setup() function without any arguments. This is a common pattern in Python packaging to configure package metadata, though here it provides no additional details. There are no signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious activity. The code appears standard and straightforward, serving the purpose of package setup without any hidden or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimalistic, standard setup script with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears legitimate and safe.",
