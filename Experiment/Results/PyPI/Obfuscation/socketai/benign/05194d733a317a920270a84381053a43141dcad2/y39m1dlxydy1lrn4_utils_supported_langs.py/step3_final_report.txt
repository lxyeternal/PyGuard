  "purpose": "Constructs nested configuration dictionaries for search schema or indexing, merging text and sort settings based on input data.",
  "sources": "Input dictionaries 'hdxQwJOPOkJtcwsARIrNwWCjluViqaJp' and parameters 'YKMOpSTCRyrvfpGQNXWHIVyCBruHpscc'.",
  "sinks": "No external I/O; data flows from input into nested dictionaries within the function.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed and merged into nested structures, with keys dynamically generated from input parameters and data.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and function names; no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or external system calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs configuration building by iterating over input dictionary keys, creating nested dictionaries with specific 'type' fields, and merging configurations using 'deepmerge'. The obfuscation of variable names suggests an attempt to conceal intent, but the logic itself is standard for schema or index configuration. No malicious patterns, network activity, or external data leaks are present. The function's purpose appears benign, focusing on data structure assembly for search or indexing schemas.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration utility with obfuscated variable names, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent based solely on this snippet. The malware score is set to 0, and the overall security risk is low (0.2), with high confidence (0.9).",
