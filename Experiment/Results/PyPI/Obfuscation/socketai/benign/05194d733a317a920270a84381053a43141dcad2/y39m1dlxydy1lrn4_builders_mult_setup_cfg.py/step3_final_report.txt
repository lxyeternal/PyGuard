  "purpose": "This code defines a custom build output class that adds a dependency 'deepmerge >=1.1.0' to the setup configuration, likely for build or packaging purposes.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'setup.cfg' output object via self.builder.get_output('cfg', 'setup.cfg')",
  "sinks": "Calls output.add_dependency('deepmerge', '>=1.1.0') to modify dependencies",
  "flows": "From retrieving the output object to adding a dependency in the build configuration",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, which are unusual and suspicious but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from OutputBuilder with obfuscated identifiers. It retrieves a setup.cfg output object and adds a dependency 'deepmerge >=1.1.0'. No network activity, data exfiltration, credential handling, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The core operation is a standard build configuration modification. Malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is evident. Obfuscation score is high (~0.75), reflecting suspicious naming. Security risk score is low (~0.2), given the benign nature of the code. The code's purpose appears to be configuration management, with obfuscation possibly intended to hide purpose but not malicious. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign build configuration modification with obfuscated naming. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malware, malicious intent, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscation high (~0.75), and low security risk (~0.2). Continued monitoring is advised if part of a larger suspicious codebase, but based on this fragment, it appears safe.",
