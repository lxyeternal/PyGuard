{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a dictionary mapping string keys to template file paths, likely used for rendering multilingual record templates.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded dictionary assignment; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'AKAtYCKQKbqiGxcpSDwVlJONqyELqRlM' which looks obfuscated or randomly generated; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely defines a static dictionary with fixed string keys and file path values. There are no user inputs, environment variable usage, network operations, or dynamic code execution. The variable name appears obfuscated, but the data itself is just static string mappings, not malicious code or obfuscated payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior. It is a static assignment of a dictionary mapping template names to file paths, with no suspicious activity or security risks identified.",
