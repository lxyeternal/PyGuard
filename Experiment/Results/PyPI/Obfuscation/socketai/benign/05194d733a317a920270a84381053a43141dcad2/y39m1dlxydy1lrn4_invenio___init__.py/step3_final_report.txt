  "purpose": "Static configuration mapping template filenames to their paths, serving as a benign setup in a templating system.",
  "sources": "No external inputs or data sources; static dictionary assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flows to untrusted sources or external systems.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignment with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name `AKAtYCKQKbqiGxcpSDwVlJONqyELqRlM`, which appears intentionally obscure but is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static dictionary defining template file paths with a nonsensical variable name. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The variable name's obfuscation is superficial and likely for naming obfuscation or concealment, not malicious intent. Malware score is zero, indicating no malicious behavior. Obfuscation score is moderate (~0.4) due to the variable name's appearance, but not suspicious enough to warrant high concern. Security risk score is very low (~0.1-0.2), consistent with static configuration code. Confidence in this assessment is high (around 0.9), given the static and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration snippet with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not constitute a security threat. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware remains at 0, obfuscation at around 0.4, and security risk at approximately 0.1-0.2.",
