{
  "purpose": "The code defines a dictionary mapping keys to template file paths, likely used for templating or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The data source is a hardcoded dictionary with string values indicating file paths.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as system commands, network calls, or data output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply initializes a static dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present. The code appears straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single assignment of a dictionary with static string values. No dynamic code execution, user input, or external data handling is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. The file paths suggest template files, which are typical in templating systems, and do not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a static configuration or mapping. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
