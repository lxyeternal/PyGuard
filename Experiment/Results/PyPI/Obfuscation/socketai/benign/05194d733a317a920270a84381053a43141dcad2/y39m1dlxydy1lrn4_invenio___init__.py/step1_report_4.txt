  "purpose": "This code defines a dictionary with keys mapping to template file paths, likely used for template rendering or configuration.",
  "sources": "The code itself is static, with no external data input or reading from untrusted sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or output data to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident, as the code consists solely of a static dictionary definition.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behaviors are detected; the code appears straightforward and typical for configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a dictionary with fixed string values pointing to template files, likely used in a templating context. There are no inputs, no processing, and no network or file operations. The structure and content are consistent with benign configuration data.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign static configuration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
