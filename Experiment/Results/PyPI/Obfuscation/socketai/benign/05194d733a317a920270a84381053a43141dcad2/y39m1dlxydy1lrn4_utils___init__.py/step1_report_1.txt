{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize a basic Python script, potentially for data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly defined.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; no external data input, environment variable access, or user input reading identified.",
  "sinks": "No suspicious or insecure output functions, network connections, or file writes detected; no data leaks or harmful actions evident.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code lacks input handling or data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code present; the script appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code reveals a simple structure without external input, data transmission, or suspicious behaviors. The code does not contain malicious logic, backdoors, or security flaws. Absence of network activity, data leaks, or obfuscated segments indicates low risk. The code structure suggests a benign utility or example script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and does not contain harmful patterns or anomalies.",
