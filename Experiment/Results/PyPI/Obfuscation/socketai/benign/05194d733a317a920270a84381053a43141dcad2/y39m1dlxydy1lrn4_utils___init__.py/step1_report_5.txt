  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package, potentially for general use or specific functionality, but the exact purpose cannot be determined due to the absence of code content.",
  "sources": "The code may read input from function parameters, environment variables, or external files, but no specific sources are visible due to lack of code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, subprocess executions, or data transmission, but none are explicitly identifiable in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Without actual code, flow analysis cannot be performed, but generally would involve tracing data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated segments are evident in the provided input, which contains no code content.",
  "analysis": "The input contains no code to analyze. Therefore, no source, sink, flow, or anomalies can be identified. The absence of code prevents any detailed security or malicious behavior assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided input, there is no code to evaluate. As a result, no malicious behavior or security risks are detectable. The code content may be missing or intentionally left empty.",
