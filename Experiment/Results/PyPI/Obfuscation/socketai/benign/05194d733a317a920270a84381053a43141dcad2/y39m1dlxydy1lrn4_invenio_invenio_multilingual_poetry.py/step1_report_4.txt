  "purpose": "Define a custom OutputBuilder class that modifies dependencies in a TOML output for a Python project.",
  "sources": "The class reads data from self.builder.get_output and the hardcoded strings for dependency versions.",
  "sinks": "Modifying the output dependencies; no untrusted data or external input sources present.",
  "flows": "Class method calls self.builder.get_output to retrieve 'pyproject.toml', then modifies its dependency fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No obfuscated code or malicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass that overrides a method to set dependencies in a project configuration file. It uses hardcoded dependency versions, which is common in build scripts. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious network activity, or suspicious logic. The dependencies are set via standard method calls, and no external or untrusted input appears to influence the code. The code's structure and logic are straightforward and typical for build customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving a typical role in configuring project dependencies. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this code fragment.",
