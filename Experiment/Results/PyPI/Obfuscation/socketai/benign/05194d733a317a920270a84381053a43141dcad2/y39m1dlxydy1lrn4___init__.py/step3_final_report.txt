  "sources": "Reads from environment variables, external files, network sources, user input.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, system commands, data outputs.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks, potentially involving dynamic code execution or data leakage pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'eval'/'exec', hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent or security risk. No explicit malicious payloads are identified, but the potential for exploitation exists. Other reports show benign patterns with no suspicious activity or obfuscation. The scores assigned reflect these observations, with Report 1 justifiably showing higher obfuscation and moderate malware potential, while others are low risk. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, indicating moderate concern primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code features in Report 1.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains obfuscation and dynamic code execution, raising moderate security concerns, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with Report 1 justifiably showing higher risk indicators. The other reports are benign, with low malware and obfuscation scores.",
