  "conclusion": "The dependency contains obfuscation and dynamic code execution, raising moderate security concerns, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with Report 1 justifiably showing higher risk indicators. The other reports are benign, with low malware and obfuscation scores."
