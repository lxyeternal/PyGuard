  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, step-by-step, to ensure consistency and accuracy.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify the class as a custom exception with obfuscated or nonsensical class names.\n- No external input, data processing, network activity, or data leaks are detected.\n- The class only assigns two attributes during initialization.\n- No malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malware activity, is evident.\n- The obfuscation appears to be either for concealment or placeholder purposes, not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Define a custom exception.\n- **Findings:** No external input, data flow, or malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, obfuscated class name, no risks.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:** The scores seem appropriate. The high confidence reflects the benign nature. No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Custom exception with status code and message.\n- **Findings:** No external data or network activity; obfuscated names.\n- **Conclusion:** Not suspicious; likely obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score is low but not zero, possibly reflecting slight concern over obfuscation. This seems reasonable given the context. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Error handling class.\n- **Findings:** No external data, no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; obfuscated name.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.4\n\n**Assessment:** The low security risk score aligns with the benign analysis. The malware score is zero, consistent with the report. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Custom exception with status info.\n- **Findings:** No data flow, no external inputs.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated but benign.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.5\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk is zero, which is consistent. The malware score is zero, appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Error handling class.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; obfuscated name.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:** The slight security risk score reflects the obfuscation, which is reasonable. Malware score remains zero.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are zero, which is consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Range from 0.4 to 0.8, reflecting the obfuscated class names. These are appropriate given the context.\n- **Security risk scores:** Mostly zero, with a slight increase (0.2, 0.1) where obfuscation is higher, which is reasonable.\n\n**Overall, the scores are consistent with the reports' reasoning.** No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.6 (average of the reports' obfuscation levels)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low, mainly due to obfuscation, but no actual risk)\n\n**Final note:** The obfuscation alone does not constitute a security risk unless combined with malicious activity, which is not present here.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The scores appropriately reflect the benign nature of the code, with obfuscation being the only notable feature. No further action or adjustment is required.",
