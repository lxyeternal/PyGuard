  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for error handling with status code and message",
  "sources": "Class instantiation; no input reading or external data sources",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external communication points",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Class name and attribute names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, but this alone is not suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code implements a subclass of Exception with an obfuscated class name and attributes. It only initializes two attributes, 'status_code' and 'status', with provided values. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The obfuscated class and variable names could be for code obfuscation or simple concealment, but do not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to define a custom exception class with obfuscated naming, which alone is not suspicious. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation may be for code concealment, but it does not constitute malicious activity.",
