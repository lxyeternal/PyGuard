  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with obfuscated name and attributes for error handling.",
  "sources": "Parameters 'status_code' and 'status' passed during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters assigned directly to instance attributes; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name; no external data, network activity, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a minimal exception class with an obfuscated name, inheriting from Exception, with an __init__ method that assigns two parameters to instance variables. No external input, data flow, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The class serves as a simple data container for error information. The obfuscated name suggests concealment but does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores at 0 and low security risks, primarily related to obfuscation. The code is syntactically correct, and no suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated exception class with no malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
