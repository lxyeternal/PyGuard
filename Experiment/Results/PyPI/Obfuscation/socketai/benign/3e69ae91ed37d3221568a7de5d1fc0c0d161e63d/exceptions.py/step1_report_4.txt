{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling specific error conditions with associated status information",
  "sources": "None (no input or data reading operations present)",
  "sinks": "None (no untrusted data usage or external effects)",
  "flows": "None (no data flow from sources to sinks, as the code is a class definition without runtime execution or data handling)",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone is not suspicious without further malicious context",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception, with an init method storing status code and status. There are no data sources, sinks, or data flow. The class name appears obfuscated, which could suggest concealment, but without additional code or malicious context, it remains inconclusive. The code is minimal and structurally normal for a Python exception class.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple, legitimate custom exception class with no clear malicious intent. The obfuscated class name alone does not indicate malicious behavior. No security risks or malware signs are evident from this snippet.",
