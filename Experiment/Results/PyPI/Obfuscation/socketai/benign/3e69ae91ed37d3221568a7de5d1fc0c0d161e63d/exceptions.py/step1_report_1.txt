  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading detected",
  "sinks": "No data output or external data transfer points observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink identified",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears random and nonsensical; no meaningful function or context",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception with an __init__ method that assigns two parameters to instance variables. The class name is a seemingly random string, which does not indicate any functional purpose or malicious intent. There are no external inputs, data manipulations, network activities, or other behaviors typical of malicious code. The code is minimal, standard in structure, and does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, benign custom exception class with an obfuscated class name that does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks.",
