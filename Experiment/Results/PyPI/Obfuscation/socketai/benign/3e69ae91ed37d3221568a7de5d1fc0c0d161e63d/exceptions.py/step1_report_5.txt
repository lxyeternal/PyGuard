  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class for error handling.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read; only class definition and constructor.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class is purely declarative.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a nonsensical class name and parameter names; no meaningful behavior or external interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, which inherits from Python's built-in Exception. The constructor assigns two parameters, status_code and status, to instance variables. There is no logic beyond class definition and variable assignment. The class does not perform any actions, logging, network activity, or data handling. The naming suggests obfuscation, but no malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this isolated snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, albeit obfuscated, custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security vulnerabilities. The unusual naming could suggest obfuscation, but it does not indicate malicious activity.",
