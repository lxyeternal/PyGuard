{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for error handling with status information.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading points present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no data sources or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a random string, which is unusual for meaningful code; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines a subclass of Exception with an initializer that stores status information. There are no external inputs, no data processing, and no malicious or suspicious behavior. The random class name might suggest obfuscation or placeholder code, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious intent. No code execution, network activity, or data leakage is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign class definition with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual class name is likely a placeholder or obfuscation, but does not pose security concerns.",
