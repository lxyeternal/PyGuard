  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Use of a seemingly random variable name without context, no actual malicious code or data handling observed",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '1.3.15' to a variable with a nonsensical name. There are no imports, function calls, or data processing. The variable name appears arbitrary and does not indicate malicious intent or obfuscation. No input/output, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. This appears to be a simple, benign variable assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward variable assignment with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and possibly part of larger code context, but on its own, it poses no threat.",
