      "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscation elements that raise suspicion but does not explicitly include malicious code. The high obfuscation score and non-standard parameter suggest potential for malicious intent or misuse. Further investigation into the package source, dependencies, and additional code is recommended before use."

      "conclusion": "The code itself is mostly benign but contains suspicious subprocess calls that could be exploited for malicious purposes, especially if 'shopeeloggingtool' is compromised. The pattern of executing inline Python code via subprocess to import external modules is a red flag. The syntax anomalies suggest possible obfuscation or mistakes. Overall, the activity warrants caution and further review, with a high suspicion of malicious intent if the external package is malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of a version string assignment to an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, with malware and security risk at 0, and a slight obfuscation score (~0.2). No further action is necessary."
