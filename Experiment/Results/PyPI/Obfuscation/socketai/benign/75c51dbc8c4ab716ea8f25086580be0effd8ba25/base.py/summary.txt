  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Django backend for Snowflake, with obfuscation likely used to conceal details. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware and security risk scores should remain low to moderate. Continuous monitoring is recommended due to obfuscation, but current analysis indicates low likelihood of malicious activity."
