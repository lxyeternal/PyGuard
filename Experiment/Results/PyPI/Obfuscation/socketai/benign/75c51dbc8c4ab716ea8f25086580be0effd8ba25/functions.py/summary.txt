  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is ORM customization involving function redefinitions and obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, malware, or backdoors. The obfuscation raises caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation high (~0.7), and moderate security risk (~0.3). Overall, the code seems to serve internal ORM purposes without malicious behavior."
