  "purpose": "To verify compatibility between django-snowflake and the installed Django version.",
  "sources": "Import statements for django and related modules; function definition that does not read external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the function appears to perform internal version compatibility checks without external input.",
  "anomalies": "Function name is obfuscated or non-descriptive; no implementation code provided to perform the version check; incomplete code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports django modules and defines a function intended to check compatibility with the installed Django version. However, the function body is incomplete and contains only a docstring, with no executable code that performs any operations. The function name is obscure, possibly obfuscated, but no malicious behavior or malicious code is evident from the provided snippet. There are no external data sources, no suspicious data flows, and no indications of malicious intent within the visible code. The code appears to be part of a larger, non-malicious compatibility check mechanism, but as-is, it does not perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be an incomplete or placeholder function intended for version compatibility verification. Based on the visible code, there are no malicious elements or security concerns.",
