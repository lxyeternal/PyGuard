The obfuscation raises caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation high (~0.7), and moderate security risk (~0.3). Overall, the code seems to serve internal ORM purposes without malicious behavior."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate Django backend for Snowflake, with obfuscation likely used to conceal details. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware and security risk scores should remain low to moderate. Continuous monitoring is recommended due to obfuscation, but current analysis indicates low likelihood of malicious activity."

The main security concern is injection risk if inputs are not sanitized. No malware or malicious activity is evident."

The obfuscation may be benign or intended to conceal purpose, but without active malicious code, the supply chain risk remains low."

The obfuscation may be intended to hide sensitive configuration details but does not constitute malicious sabotage. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is low. No modifications to the scores or assessment are necessary."

While no malware or malicious payloads are evident, the insecure practices pose a security risk. Obfuscation further complicates review and maintenance. It is recommended to refactor the code to use parameterized queries, improve naming clarity, and implement input validation to mitigate injection vulnerabilities."
