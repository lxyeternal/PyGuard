{
  "purpose": "The code imports future features to ensure compatibility across Python 2 and 3 environments.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data paths since the code consists solely of import statements.",
  "anomalies": "The code is limited to future import statements with no additional logic, which is unusual if considered alone, but typical for compatibility shims.",
  "analysis": "The code only includes future import statements for absolute_import, print_function, and unicode_literals. These are used to make code compatible between Python 2 and 3, and do not perform any malicious actions. There are no other operations, data flows, or suspicious constructs. This appears to be a standard compatibility pattern. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident in these lines alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a compatibility layer without any malicious intent. No malware or security risks are detected based on this fragment.",
