  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe code that only contains `__future__` import statements.\n- There are no data sources, sinks, or flows.\n- The code is straightforward, serving solely for Python 2/3 compatibility.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or complex logic.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Specific Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Assessment:** Correct; the code only imports future features, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, which are reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, no issues.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as above; the reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, consistent.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous, with slightly lower confidence (0.9). Still accurate.\n- **Scores:** All zeros, appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Assessment:** Correct; no issues.\n- **Scores:** All zeros.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Assessment:** Same as others; standard boilerplate.\n- **Scores:** All zeros.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Analysis:\n- **Are the issues present?** No, all reports correctly identify the code as benign.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?** No, all reports are consistent and accurate.\n- **Scores:** Since there's no malicious activity, malware, or obfuscation, all scores of 0 are appropriate.\n- **Risk scores:** Should remain at 0, as there's no security risk.\n- **Malware score justification:** The code is entirely benign; no malicious intent or behavior.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities based on assumptions?** No, the reports avoid unwarranted assumptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a minimal, standard compatibility boilerplate with no security concerns. All reports are accurate, and the scoring aligns with the content.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The initial reports are thorough and correct. No changes needed.",
