  "purpose": "This code imports future features to ensure compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains future import statements with no further logic, which is normal for compatibility purposes.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of import statements for future features: absolute_import, print_function, and unicode_literals. These are commonly used for compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3, and do not perform any data processing, I/O, or malicious actions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The code fragment is straightforward and typical for compatibility setups.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to import future features for compatibility. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks present.",
