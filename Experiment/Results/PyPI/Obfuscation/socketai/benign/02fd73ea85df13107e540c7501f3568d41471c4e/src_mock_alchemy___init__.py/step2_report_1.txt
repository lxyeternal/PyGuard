  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully and compare them with the original code.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - The original code only contains `__future__` import statements, which are standard for compatibility purposes.\n   - No data input/output, data flows, or malicious actions are present.\n   - All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this code segment.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.\n   - They correctly note the lack of anomalies, suspicious behavior, or malicious intent.\n   - No logical errors or misinterpretations are evident.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - All reports assign `malware` scores of 0, which is appropriate given the benign nature.\n   - `securityRisk` scores are also 0, aligning with the analysis.\n   - `obfuscated` scores are 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Higher Risk Scores:**\n   - Since the code is purely import statements for compatibility, raising risk scores above 0.5 would be unjustified.\n   - No signs of malicious activity justify any higher scores.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection:**\n   - All reports correctly identify no malware activity.\n   - The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - The reports avoid speculative claims; they base their conclusions on the code content.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions are made about potential vulnerabilities.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the code's nature and the analysis provided.\n   - No discrepancies are observed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a minimal, standard compatibility snippet with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate, and the code poses no security risk. The assessments correctly reflect the benign nature of the code snippet.",
