  "purpose": "Minimal compatibility imports for Python 2/3 transition",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains import statements from __future__",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external interactions present",
  "flows": "None; no source-to-sink data paths",
  "anomalies": "None; standard boilerplate code with no suspicious or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of __future__ import statements to ensure compatibility between Python 2 and 3. There are no data inputs, outputs, or executable logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or anomalies are present. The code is a common pattern used in compatibility layers, and the absence of data flows or external interactions indicates benign intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for compatibility, with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or escalations are necessary.",
