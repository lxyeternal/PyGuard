  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated testing utility for custom assertions, with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or intellectual property protection rather than malicious intent. Scores should reflect zero malware risk, high obfuscation, and low security risk."
