  "purpose": "A utility class for custom assertions in testing, adding type-specific equality functions and raising exceptions on mismatch.",
  "sources": "Imported comparison functions from a local module, data processed in the assertion method.",
  "sinks": "Exception message formatting potentially including untrusted 'msg' data.",
  "flows": "Input data passed to comparison functions, processed, and used in exception messages if inequality is detected.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and function names; use of formatted exception messages that could include untrusted data.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class for custom equality assertions, utilizing imported comparison functions. It adds type-specific equality functions during initialization and raises exceptions with formatted messages if comparisons fail. No network, file, or system modifications are present. Obfuscation suggests concealment but not malicious intent. The exception message formatting could pose minor security concerns if 'msg' contains untrusted data, but overall, the code functions as a testing utility without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated testing utility for custom assertions, with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or intellectual property protection rather than malicious intent. Scores should reflect zero malware risk, high obfuscation, and low security risk.",
