{
  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely indicating the package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded string value assigned to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external communication occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; only a static variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated and does not describe its purpose; no other suspicious behavior or code anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name and a string value that resembles a version identifier. There are no inputs, outputs, or operations indicating malicious intent. The variable name could be intentionally obscured, but the value is a typical version string, common in package metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name with no signs of malicious behavior. The obscurity of the variable name alone is not suspicious enough to suggest malicious intent.",
