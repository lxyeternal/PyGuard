{
  "purpose": "Define several Enum classes with auto-generated members for use in other parts of a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code imports future annotations, enum module, and defines enum classes with members using auto() and explicit integer assignments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data; no input/output operations or data handling that could lead to leaks or injections.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code solely defines enum classes without processing or handling untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure class and member names suggests code obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code segments are present. No dynamic execution or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ annotations for compatibility and defines several enum classes with nonsensical or obfuscated names, using auto() for member value assignment or explicit integers. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, network communication, or runtime behavior. The naming pattern appears to be intentionally obscure, possibly to hinder understanding, but no malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident. The code is purely structural, serving as data definitions without active malicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely consists of enum class definitions with obfuscated identifiers. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or system modification. There are no signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks based on the provided content.",
