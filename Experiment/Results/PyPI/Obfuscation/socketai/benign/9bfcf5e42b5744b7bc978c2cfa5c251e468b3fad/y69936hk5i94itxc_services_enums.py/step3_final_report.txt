{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple enum classes with obfuscated names, serving as categorization or configuration constants within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only through class definitions; no external data sources are accessed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects, as the code contains only static enum declarations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and member names are present, which could hinder analysis but do not indicate malicious activity. No dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of enum class definitions with obfuscated names, lacking functions, I/O, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for IP protection or reverse engineering hindrance. No signs of malicious behavior, such as payloads, data exfiltration, or system manipulation, are present. The scores assigned in the reports—malware=0, low security risk (~0.1), high obfuscation—are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static configuration or categorization enums with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects naming obscurity but does not imply malicious activity. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
