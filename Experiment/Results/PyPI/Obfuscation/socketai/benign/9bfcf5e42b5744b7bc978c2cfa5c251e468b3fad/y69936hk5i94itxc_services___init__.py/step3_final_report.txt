  "justification": "The first report's detailed description of suspicious patterns such as eval(), hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation justifies high malware (0.8), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.85) scores. The other reports lack code or evidence of malicious activity, warranting zero scores for malware and obfuscation, and a low security risk (~0.2). To better align with the benign nature of reports 3, 4, and 5, the security risk score for report 3 is lowered from 0.3 to 0.2, reflecting minimal residual concern. Overall, the scores are consistent with the evidence, with the primary concern centered on report 1's indicators.",
