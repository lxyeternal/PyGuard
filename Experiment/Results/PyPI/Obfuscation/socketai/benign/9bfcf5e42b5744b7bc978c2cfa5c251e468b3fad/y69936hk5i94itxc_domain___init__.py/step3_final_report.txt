  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No code provided; analysis based on descriptions and summaries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows identified; no sinks detected due to absence of code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink flows possible without code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; reports note potential dynamic code execution but no evidence.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code, leading to low malware and obfuscation scores. Confidence scores are moderate, reflecting limited information. Security risk scores are slightly conservative at 0.2 in some reports, which is acceptable given potential concerns about dynamic execution, but could be lowered to 0 for consistency. No suspicious patterns or malicious activity are indicated. The scores are aligned with the evidence, or lack thereof.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, all reports' assessments are appropriate. Malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The security risk scores could be adjusted downward to 0 to better reflect the lack of evidence, but the current conservative scores are acceptable. Overall, the reports are consistent and cautious, accurately reflecting the limited information.",
