  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, all reports' assessments are appropriate. Malware and obfuscation scores should remain at 0. The security risk scores could be adjusted downward to 0 to better reflect the lack of evidence, but the current conservative scores are acceptable. Overall, the reports are consistent and cautious, accurately reflecting the limited information."
