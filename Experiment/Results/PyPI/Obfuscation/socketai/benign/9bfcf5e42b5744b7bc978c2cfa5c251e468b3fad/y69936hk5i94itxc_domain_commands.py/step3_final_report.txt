{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures, constants, and utility functions for data processing and configuration within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, utility functions that process strings and data attributes",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or file operations are present",
  "flows": "Data flows within class methods, especially in data transformation functions like VAaNvUryqsMXhdfyZThwzFHssldXqDzL",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and variable names; no comments or documentation; constants and class attributes seem placeholder-like or auto-generated",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of data class definitions, constants, and simple utility functions that perform data transformations such as string splitting/joining and type conversions. There are no external data sources, network activity, or system modifications. The obfuscated naming pattern suggests code obfuscation or auto-generation but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious operations are evident. The functions are straightforward and serve as data models or configuration holders. Given the absence of external interactions, malicious code, or security-sensitive operations, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data structures and utility functions with obfuscated identifiers but no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (0.2) are justified. Obfuscation is noted but not indicative of malicious intent in this context.",
