{
  "purpose": "The code defines AWS CloudFormation resource classes and data types for Managed Blockchain, primarily used for infrastructure as code deployment via AWS CDK.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, property getters/setters, and data type initializations that read input parameters and configuration data.",
  "sinks": "Data flows into class instances and jsii invocation methods, which generate resource templates; no external network or file system interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are stored in internal variables and passed to jsii.create or jsii.invoke calls, which interface with the underlying AWS CDK framework.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are placeholders (`pass`) with no operational logic; class and function names are heavily obfuscated, likely due to auto-generation or minification; no secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class definitions, data structures, and placeholder functions typical of auto-generated SDK or resource schema code. There are no runtime behaviors, network calls, or data exfiltration activities. Obfuscation appears to be a byproduct of code generation rather than malicious intent. The presence of type checks and attribute accessors aligns with infrastructure modeling, not malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, auto-generated resource scaffolding for AWS Managed Blockchain via AWS CDK. No signs of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior are detected. Obfuscation is consistent with code generation artifacts, not malicious hiding.",
