  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific data processing task, possibly involving network communication or data manipulation, though the exact intent is unclear due to incomplete information.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input, or network sources, but specific source locations are not clearly identified due to lack of detailed code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, network sockets, file writes, or database queries, but specific sink points are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to sinks through various intermediate steps; however, without detailed code, exact source-to-sink paths cannot be fully determined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual code structures are evident from the provided fragment. The code does not show signs of malicious obfuscation or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python script without evident malicious constructs. It uses common libraries and functions. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious backdoors are apparent. The absence of detailed code limits confidence, but based on visible elements, there are no signs of malicious intent. The code may perform legitimate data processing tasks without security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The script seems to be a benign data processing tool. However, due to limited visibility into the full implementation, the confidence level remains moderate.",
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "obfuscated": 0,
