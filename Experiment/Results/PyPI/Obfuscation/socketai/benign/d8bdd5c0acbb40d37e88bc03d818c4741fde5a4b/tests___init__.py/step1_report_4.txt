  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns detected; code appears empty or non-existent",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment is empty or absent, resulting in no observable data sources, sinks, or flows. Without code content, there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation detected.",
  "conclusion": "No code available for review; therefore, no malicious behavior or security issues can be identified. The lack of code indicates a neutral or empty module with no detectable threats.",
