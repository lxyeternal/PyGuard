      "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and likely used for testing or configuration. No malicious activity or suspicious patterns are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate. The main caveat is the behavior of 'func_main2', which cannot be assessed here, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe."

      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated Django configuration class that registers a system check. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors. The low malware score (~0.1) and low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants further review of the imported 'system_checks' module, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward middleware configuration snippet with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute a threat. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0.6, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated middleware that manipulates template context data without evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware risk remains low. The moderate security risk suggests caution, especially if data sources are untrusted. Further validation of imported modules and settings is recommended before deployment."

No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation pattern warrants cautious review but does not justify higher malware or risk scores."

      "conclusion": "Report 4 indicates potentially malicious and obfuscated code, with scores of 0.6 (malware), 0.8 (obfuscated), and 0.65 (security risk). Other reports are largely benign with low scores. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), primarily driven by Report 4's indicators. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious code segments."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated filtering framework with no direct evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation and dynamic attribute management raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. It warrants further review of the imported class and overall context but is likely low risk based on static analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify elevated malware or risk scores. The current assessments are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Continued monitoring of the larger codebase is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious behavior is present."
