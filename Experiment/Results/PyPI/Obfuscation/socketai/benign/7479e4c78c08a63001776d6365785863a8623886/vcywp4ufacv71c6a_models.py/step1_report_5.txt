  "purpose": "Defines a Django model subclass and conditionally imports a module based on a setting value",
  "sources": "Reading the setting 'AtrNgWCIMdjASWNSGmOddeRKFwLnVhxt' from Django settings",

  "flows": "Reading 'settings.AtrNgWCIMdjASWNSGmOddeRKFwLnVhxt' -> Conditional branch -> Import of '.tests.models'",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obscure setting name that appears as a randomized string; no other suspicious code behaviors or hardcoded secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django configuration and a model base class, then defines an empty model class. It then checks a setting with an obscure name; if the condition matches, it imports a module from the same package. There are no signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated malicious logic. The conditional import might be used for testing or environment-specific behavior but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django pattern with an unusual setting name, likely for configuration or environment-specific purposes. No malicious or malicious-suspicious behavior is evident.",
