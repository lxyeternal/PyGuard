  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval(), exec(), dynamic import statements, and complex or obfuscated code structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "From dynamic code execution sources (eval, exec, import) to potential malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, use of eval()/exec(), dynamic imports, suspicious variable names, or control flow patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution in Report 4, justifying higher malware and obfuscation scores. Other reports show minimal or no suspicious activity, with scores reflecting their benign or uncertain nature. The scores are consistent with the described features, with Report 4 warranting the highest suspicion. Overall, the assessment aligns with the evidence, and no significant adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Report 4 indicates potentially malicious and obfuscated code, with scores of 0.6 (malware), 0.8 (obfuscated), and 0.65 (security risk). Other reports are largely benign with low scores. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), primarily driven by Report 4's indicators. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious code segments.",
