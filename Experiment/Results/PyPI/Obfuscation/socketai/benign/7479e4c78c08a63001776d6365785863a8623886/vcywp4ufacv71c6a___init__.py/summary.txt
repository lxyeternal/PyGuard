  "conclusion": "Report 4 indicates potentially malicious and obfuscated code, with scores of 0.6 (malware), 0.8 (obfuscated), and 0.65 (security risk). Other reports are largely benign with low scores. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), primarily driven by Report 4's indicators. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious code segments."
