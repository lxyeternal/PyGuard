  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated Django configuration class that registers a system check. Despite heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain attack vectors. The low malware score (~0.1) and low security risk (~0.2) are appropriate. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants further review of the imported 'system_checks' module, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign."
