  "purpose": "Middleware configuration and validation using static parameters with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string parameters used in the call to edc_middleware_check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, network, or file operations; static configuration parameters only.",
  "flows": "Function call passing static strings to edc_middleware_check; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name assigned to style object; static parameters that could be sensitive if contextually relevant.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django's color_style and a custom middleware check function, assigns an obfuscated variable, and calls the middleware check with static strings. No malicious activity, data leaks, or network operations are present. Obfuscation is superficial, likely for concealment, but does not imply malicious intent. The static parameters are typical in configuration code. The overall structure indicates a benign purpose, with obfuscation as the only concern, which is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward middleware configuration snippet with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute a threat. The assigned scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0.6, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the analysis.",
