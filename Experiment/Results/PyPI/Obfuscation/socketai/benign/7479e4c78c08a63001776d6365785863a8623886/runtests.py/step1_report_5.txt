{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that imports and calls a function named 'func_main2' with specific string arguments, likely for testing or execution of test modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it only imports a function and calls it with hardcoded string parameters.",
  "sinks": "The function 'func_main2' is called with string arguments that may be used internally for dynamic importing or execution, but no explicit data sinks such as network or file operations are visible here.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the function call 'func_main2' with predefined string arguments, which may internally lead to dynamic code execution or testing procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies are evident in this snippet. The code is straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior. The imported function's behavior is unknown but not inherently malicious based on this snippet alone.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function and calls it with specific test-related string arguments. The absence of any user input, environment variable usage, or network operations suggests this is a benign testing or setup script. Without knowledge of 'func_main2' implementation, no malicious activity can be inferred from this code fragment. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code is likely part of a test suite or setup process, executing a function with predefined parameters. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
