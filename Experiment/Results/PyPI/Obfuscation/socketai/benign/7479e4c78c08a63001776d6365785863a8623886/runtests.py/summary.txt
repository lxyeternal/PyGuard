  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and likely used for testing or configuration. No malicious activity or suspicious patterns are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate. The main caveat is the behavior of 'func_main2', which cannot be assessed here, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe."
