{
  "purpose": "Invoke the function 'func_main2' with specific module and test suite identifiers, likely for testing or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or untrusted data; it imports a function from a local module and calls it with fixed string arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'func_main2' with fixed string parameters; potential issues depend on what 'func_main2' does internally, but no direct unsafe operations are visible here.",
  "flows": "The script executes the import, then calls 'func_main2' with specific string arguments; any data flow depends on 'func_main2's implementation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code behavior are apparent; the code is straightforward and standard for invoking a function.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up a typical Python main entry point and calls a function with static string arguments. Without insight into 'func_main2's implementation, no malicious or suspicious activity can be inferred. The code does not handle untrusted input, does not perform network operations, and lacks obfuscation or complex logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a simple script invoking a test or setup function with predefined arguments.",
