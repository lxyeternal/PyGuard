{
  "purpose": "Invoke the function 'func_main2' from the 'edc_test_settings.func_main' module with specific test parameters, likely for testing or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs directly; it imports a module and calls a function with hardcoded string arguments.",
  "sinks": "The function call to 'func_main2' may be a sink if it performs operations on untrusted data or triggers sensitive actions, but based solely on this code, no such actions are evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks is observable; the flow is limited to a function call with static string arguments.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a specific function and executes it with fixed string parameters when run as the main module. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or malicious constructs. The function 'func_main2' may perform testing or configuration tasks, but without its implementation, no malicious intent can be inferred. The code appears to be a standard test or setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple invocation of a function with hardcoded parameters, with no evident malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. It likely serves a testing or configuration purpose.",
