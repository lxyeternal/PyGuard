{
  "purpose": "The code appears to invoke a function called func_main2 with specific module and package names, likely for testing or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input, but it calls an imported function, which may internally read data or perform actions.",
  "sinks": "The function call to func_main2 could be a sink if it executes code or performs actions based on the provided arguments, especially if those arguments influence execution flow or data handling.",
  "flows": "The source (function call with string arguments) leads to the invocation of func_main2, which may execute code or perform operations based on these arguments.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a straightforward function call with hardcoded string parameters; there are no signs of obfuscation, hidden code, or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is visible.",
  "analysis": "The script imports a function from a module and calls it with specific string arguments related to test settings or test modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation within this snippet. The function's behavior depends on its implementation, which is not provided. The code is simple, direct, and appears to be part of a testing or configuration setup. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard script to invoke a specific function with predefined parameters. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based on the visible code. It is likely benign and intended for testing or configuration purposes.",
