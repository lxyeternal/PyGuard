{
  "purpose": "Invoke the function 'func_main2' with specific test module and package identifiers, likely for testing or setup purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports a function and calls it with static string arguments.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, 'func_main2' could perform actions based on the arguments, but no direct sinks are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The source is the static call to 'func_main2' with fixed arguments; the flow depends on 'func_main2's implementation, which is unknown.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal script that imports a function and calls it with fixed string arguments. It does not read external input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. The security risk and malware scores should be low, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The primary unknown is the behavior of 'func_main2', but based on this snippet alone, the code appears benign. The reports correctly assign a malware score of 0 and low security risk scores, reflecting the benign nature. The confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and transparency of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, straightforward, and likely used for testing or configuration. No malicious activity or suspicious patterns are evident. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and a low security risk (~0.1) are appropriate. The main caveat is the behavior of 'func_main2', which cannot be assessed here, but based solely on this snippet, the code is safe.",
