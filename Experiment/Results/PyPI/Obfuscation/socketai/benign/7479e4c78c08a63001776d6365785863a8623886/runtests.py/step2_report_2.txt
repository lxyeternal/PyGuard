  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Imports `func_main2` from `edc_test_settings.func_main`.\n- Calls `func_main2` with two hardcoded string arguments.\n- No external input, no obfuscation, no apparent malicious activity.\n- The code appears to be a simple test or setup script.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present:\n- The code itself is straightforward and does not contain any malicious or suspicious constructs.\n- The function `func_main2`'s behavior is unknown, but based on the code snippet, there's no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes in reports:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a simple invocation of a function with static string arguments.\n- They also correctly note that without the implementation of `func_main2`, no definitive security risk can be established.\n- No report claims that the code contains obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or malicious payloads, which aligns with the code provided.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the evidence.\n- The `securityRisk` scores are low (around 0.1 to 0.2), which seems reasonable.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.8 to 0.9), consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since the code is a simple test invocation with no external input, network activity, or obfuscation, the risk scores should remain very low.\n- The only caveat is the behavior of `func_main2`. If it internally executes code based on the arguments, that could introduce risk, but we cannot assume that from this snippet alone.\n\n### Potential issues:\n- No issues are evident in the code snippet itself.\n- The reports do not overstate or understate the risk; they appropriately highlight the lack of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious activity.\n**Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward, no obfuscation.\n**Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal risk, given the context and lack of external input or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate in their assessment that this code appears benign and intended for testing or configuration purposes. The scores assigned are reasonable and justified based on the provided snippet.\n\n**Note:** If `func_main2` internally performs unsafe operations, that risk cannot be inferred here. But based solely on this code, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores, but keep in mind that any internal behavior of `func_main2` could alter the risk profile if it performs unsafe actions.",
