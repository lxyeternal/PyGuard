  "purpose": "Define URL routing for the Django application, mapping the root URL to the HomeView.",
  "sources": "Import statements for URL configuration and view; assignment of a string and a list containing a URL pattern.",
  "sinks": "URL pattern registration in the Django framework.",
  "flows": "Import statements → Variable assignments → URL pattern registration via path()",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., PeWoDsRMVaDoNPAoKNlktceKaeVLSeWl, IZNzptiMNRJRvaYmMagGcJUmRxmMBvel) which are obfuscated or meaningless; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or malicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for URL configuration in Django. It assigns obfuscated variable names to strings and lists, which could be suspicious but do not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The URL pattern maps the root URL ('') to HomeView, a typical pattern for a homepage. The variable naming suggests obfuscation but does not directly involve malicious code. No user input processing, external data sources, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django URL configuration with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware; the obfuscation appears superficial and does not affect functionality. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
