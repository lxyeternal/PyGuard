  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated middleware that manipulates template context data without evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware risk remains low. The moderate security risk suggests caution, especially if data sources are untrusted. Further validation of imported modules and settings is recommended before deployment."
