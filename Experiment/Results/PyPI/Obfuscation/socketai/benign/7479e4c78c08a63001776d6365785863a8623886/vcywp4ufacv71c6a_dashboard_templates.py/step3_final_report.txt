{
  "purpose": "Assigns a dictionary with a template path to a variable with an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "None; static assignment, no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static assignment only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no malicious code or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple static assignment of a dictionary to an obfuscated variable name. No external inputs, outputs, or dynamic code execution are present. The variable name appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware score is zero; obfuscation is moderate to high but justified by the variable name; security risk is minimal. No signs of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a static configuration assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely due to code generation or minimization, not malicious intent.",
