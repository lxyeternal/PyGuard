  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from internal modules related to listboard filtering and viewing filters.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from local modules",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data handling, user input, or network operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as only imports are performed",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers (PVRTBKtqHeZCBtCUsDunFIWuJiHMeQhz and FVGLVRndBPSiUlSAQUNNppwVuIASIdSd) appear as obfuscated or randomly generated strings, which could suggest obfuscation or attempt to hide intent, but this alone is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from local modules, importing obfuscated class or function names. There is no code execution, data handling, or external network activity. The use of seemingly random names could be benign obfuscation or intentionally obscure code, but no malicious activity or malicious patterns are identifiable from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal, obfuscated-looking import statement with no apparent malicious behavior. No external data, no network activity, and no suspicious operations are present. The obfuscated names might suggest code obfuscation but do not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
