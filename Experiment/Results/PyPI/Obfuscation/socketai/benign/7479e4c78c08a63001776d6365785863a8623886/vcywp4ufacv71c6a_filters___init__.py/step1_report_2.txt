  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules within a package",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes/functions from relative modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; just static imports",
  "anomalies": "Imported names appear to be obfuscated or randomly generated; no descriptive naming",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing from local modules using relative paths. The imported identifiers (PVRTBKtqHeZCBtCUsDunFIWuJiHMeQhz and FVGLVRndBPSiUlSAQUNNppwVuIASIdSd) are non-descriptive and appear to be randomly generated, which could suggest obfuscation. There is no evidence of code execution, data handling, or malicious behavior. The code itself is minimal and does not contain suspicious logic. However, the obfuscated identifiers could be a sign of attempt to hide malicious or unwanted behavior in the larger context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to simple import statements with obfuscated names, which alone do not indicate malicious activity. However, the obfuscation warrants cautious review of the larger codebase for potential malicious intent or malicious hidden code.",
