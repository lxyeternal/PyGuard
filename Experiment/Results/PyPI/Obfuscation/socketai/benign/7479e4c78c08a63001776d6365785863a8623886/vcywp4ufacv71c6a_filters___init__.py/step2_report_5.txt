  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports identify the code as only consisting of import statements from local modules.\n- The imported identifiers appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which could suggest obfuscation or code hiding.\n- No actual data flow, execution, or malicious activity is observed or suggested.\n- The malware scores are very low (0 or 0.1), aligning with the absence of evidence for malicious behavior.\n- The security risk scores are also low (mostly 0.1-0.2), which seems appropriate given the limited code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and issues:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  Yes, the code is just import statements with obfuscated names. No dynamic or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation is suspicious but not necessarily malicious.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  The reports correctly identify the obfuscation but tend to lean towards caution rather than evidence of malicious intent. This is reasonable, given only import statements are shown.\n\n- **Scores review:**  \n  The malware scores are appropriately low. The security risk scores are also low, consistent with the limited code.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n\n- The **malware scores** are mostly 0 or 0.1, which is justified given no malicious activity is observed.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are high (mostly 0.6-0.8), which makes sense given the naming.\n- The **risk scores** are low (mostly 0.1-0.2), appropriate for just import statements.\n\n### Should any scores be adjusted?\n\n- Since no actual malicious activity or code execution is demonstrated, **malware scores** should remain very low.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are fine, reflecting the obfuscated identifiers.\n- The **security risk scores** could be slightly increased if we consider obfuscation as a potential risk, but given the evidence, they seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** Should remain near 0, as no malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Should stay high (~0.7), as obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay low (~0.2), given the lack of actual malicious activity but acknowledging obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the provided reports and analysis, **the current scores are reasonable**. The code is minimal and obfuscated, but there's no evidence of malicious activity or security risk beyond obfuscation.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 – no malicious activity observed.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 – identifiers are clearly obfuscated.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 – obfuscation warrants caution but no direct threat.\n\n**Final note:** Continue monitoring larger code context for any hidden malicious behavior, especially in code with obfuscated identifiers.",
