  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data processing or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers (PVRTBKtqHeZCBtCUsDunFIWuJiHMeQhz, FVGLVRndBPSiUlSAQUNNppwVuIASIdSd) appear as randomly generated strings, possibly indicating obfuscation or code hiding. No other code is provided, so analysis is limited.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing obfuscated-looking identifiers from local modules. Without further code, no dynamic behavior, data flow, or malicious activity can be determined. The unusual naming suggests potential obfuscation, but no malicious actions are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from these lines alone. The code may be intentionally obscured, but no malicious intent can be confirmed at this stage.",
