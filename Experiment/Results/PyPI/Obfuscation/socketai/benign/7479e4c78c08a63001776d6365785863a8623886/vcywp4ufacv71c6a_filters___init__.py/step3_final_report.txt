  "purpose": "Import obfuscated modules related to listboard filtering and viewing.",
  "sources": "Local modules 'listboard_filter' and 'listboard_view_filters' with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None observed; code only contains import statements.",
  "flows": "No data flow or external communication; only static imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers for imported modules, which could indicate obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules with obfuscated names. No dynamic code, data processing, or network activity is present. The obfuscation level is high, which warrants caution but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriately low (0 or 0.1), reflecting no evidence of malicious behavior. Risk scores are low (~0.2), consistent with the minimal activity. The obfuscation could be for legitimate reasons such as code hiding or intellectual property protection. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are detected. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern but not evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify elevated malware or risk scores. The current assessments are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Continued monitoring of the larger codebase is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious behavior is present.",
