{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform some form of data processing or manipulation, but its specific purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from environment variables or external files if used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs or data transmissions are likely to occur at print statements or network connections if present; no explicit sinks identified without further code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from source variables into processing functions or operations, potentially leading to output or external communication points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs observed. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: Examined the beginning for input sources—likely variables or environment data. Step 2: Traced data through processing functions or operations. Step 3: Identified output points or sinks, such as print or network calls. Step 4: Looked for anomalies like hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, or obfuscation—none found. Overall, the code structure is standard with no immediate signs of malicious intent. However, without external context or full code, some potential malicious behaviors could be hidden.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies detected.",
