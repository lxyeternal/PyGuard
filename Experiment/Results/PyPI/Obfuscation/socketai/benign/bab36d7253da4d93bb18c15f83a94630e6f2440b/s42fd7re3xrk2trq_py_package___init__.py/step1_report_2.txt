  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package, possibly for general functionality or specific features related to the project it belongs to.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user input, or external files (if present). Specific data input points are not explicitly shown in the provided code fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could be network calls, file writes, or system commands if such functions are present. The code does not show direct use of these, but such operations should be scrutinized if they exist.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs to sinks like network transmission, file storage, or system commands. No explicit flows are identified in the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code structure appears standard. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution mechanisms are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code analysis indicates typical Python package structure with standard library usage. No malicious behavior, such as code injection, data exfiltration, or harmful system modifications, is apparent. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal. The absence of suspicious patterns suggests a benign purpose, although the full context of the code could reveal additional details.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard and free from supply chain threats or malicious intent. However, without complete context or detailed inspection of all parts, this assessment remains with low to moderate confidence.",
