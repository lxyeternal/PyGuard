  "malware_score": 0.45,
  "security_risk": 0.55,
  "obfuscated": 0.55,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The code reviews indicate mostly benign code with some instances of obfuscation and dynamic execution that raise suspicion but are not definitively malicious. The scores are generally consistent with the described behaviors, with minor adjustments suggested for accuracy. Overall, the supply chain risk appears moderate, with some components warranting closer scrutiny."
