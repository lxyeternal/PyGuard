      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated setup script that employs risky practices like dynamic execution and system calls but shows no explicit malicious payloads or malware. Its obfuscation and use of exec() and os.system() warrant caution, and it should be reviewed and refactored for safety before deployment."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI wrapper with signs of obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise based solely on this snippet. The low malware score (0.0) and moderate obfuscation score (0.6) are appropriate. Overall, the security risk is low (0.2), primarily due to obfuscation and potential misuse of plugin features, but no active threats are evident."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign version check that raises an exception with an informational message if 'bytes' is 'str'. The use of 'bytes' as a variable name is unconventional but not malicious. The exception halts execution to enforce Python 3 usage, which is a common pattern. The scores assigned are justified and consistent with the code's behavior."

      "conclusion": "The first report's high scores are justified if the described malicious features are present. The other reports correctly assign low or zero scores based on benign descriptions. Overall, the scoring aligns with the reported features and reasoning, indicating a moderate to high risk primarily driven by the first report."

      "conclusion": "The majority of code snippets are benign with low security risk. Report 4 warrants cautious attention due to obfuscation and dynamic code features, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present. The scores align well with the described code characteristics, with a minor adjustment to malware score in Report 4 being optional for increased caution."

Minor adjustments to risk scores for empty code snippets to zero are recommended. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is considered safe based on available information."

The scores are generally consistent with the described behaviors, with minor adjustments suggested for accuracy. Overall, the supply chain risk appears moderate, with some components warranting closer scrutiny."
