  "conclusion": "The majority of code snippets are benign with low security risk. Report 4 warrants cautious attention due to obfuscation and dynamic code features, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present. The scores align well with the described code characteristics, with a minor adjustment to malware score in Report 4 being optional for increased caution."
