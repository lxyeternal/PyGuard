  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, file I/O, network operations, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), input parameters.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and inputs flow into dynamic execution or network/file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of eval/exec, complex control flow, ambiguous data sources, absence of explicit purpose in some snippets.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate benign code with standard constructs, no suspicious patterns, and appropriate low scores for malware and obfuscation. Report 4 highlights obfuscation and dynamic execution, raising suspicion; its malware score is 0.4, obfuscation 0.8, and risk 0.55, which are justified given the described features. Slightly increasing malware suspicion to 0.5 could be considered, but current scores are reasonable. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the code features and analysis provided.",
  "conclusion": "The majority of code snippets are benign with low security risk. Report 4 warrants cautious attention due to obfuscation and dynamic code features, but no confirmed malicious payloads are present. The scores align well with the described code characteristics, with a minor adjustment to malware score in Report 4 being optional for increased caution.",
