  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python script or package component, possibly for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external modules or files (if present). Specific input sources are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, environment variable access, or execution functions if used, but no such suspicious activity is evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (parameters, environment variables) through processing functions to outputs or other system interactions, but no malicious flow paths are apparent in the current code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual constructs are observed. The code structure appears straightforward without obfuscation or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with no signs of obfuscation, malicious imports, or suspicious control flow. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoor mechanisms are evident. The absence of risky patterns suggests it is a benign component. Without additional context or hidden logic, the code does not demonstrate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and straightforward, with no suspicious patterns or activities identified.",
