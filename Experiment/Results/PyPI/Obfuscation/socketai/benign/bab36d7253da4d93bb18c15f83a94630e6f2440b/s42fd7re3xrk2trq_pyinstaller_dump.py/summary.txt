  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate CLI wrapper with signs of obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise based solely on this snippet. The low malware score (0.0) and moderate obfuscation score (0.6) are appropriate. Overall, the security risk is low (0.2), primarily due to obfuscation and potential misuse of plugin features, but no active threats are evident."
