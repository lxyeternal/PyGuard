  "purpose": "This code snippet is a version check that raises an exception with an informational message if the variable 'bytes' is of type str, indicating that the environment is Python 2.",
  "sources": "The variable 'bytes' is checked for its type, which is a source of input or environmental context.",
  "sinks": "Raising an Exception with a message, which could potentially disrupt normal program flow but is not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "The code checks the type of 'bytes' and if it is 'str', it raises an exception with a message guiding the user to upgrade to Python 3.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a straightforward version check. There are no unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors. The message is informational and not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code tests if 'bytes' is of type 'str', which likely indicates a check for Python 2 compatibility. If true, it raises an exception with a detailed message encouraging users to upgrade to Python 3. The code is simple, with no obfuscated elements or suspicious behavior. There are no external data flows or dangerous sinks involved. The message is purely informational, with no indications of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign version compatibility check that enforces Python 3 usage. It contains no malicious behavior or security risks.",
