  "purpose": "The code checks if the variable 'bytes' is a string and raises an exception with a welcome message about transitioning to Python 3.",
  "sources": "The code reads the variable 'bytes'.",
  "sinks": "The exception raising mechanism; the message output is not a sink for untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input data ('bytes') is checked; if true, an exception with a static message is raised. No untrusted data flows into a sink that causes harm.",
  "anomalies": "The code is very minimal; it contains a condition and an exception with a static message. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The message appears to be informational and promotional.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a type check on the variable 'bytes'. If 'bytes' is a string, it raises an exception with a user-facing message about transitioning to Python 3 and linking to a GitHub page. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or malicious payloads. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or access sensitive data. It appears to be a simple version check and a user notification.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as a version or compatibility notice with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not perform any malicious actions or pose security threats.",
