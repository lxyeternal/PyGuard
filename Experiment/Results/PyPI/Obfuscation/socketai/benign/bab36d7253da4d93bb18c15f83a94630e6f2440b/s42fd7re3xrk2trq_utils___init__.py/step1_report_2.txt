  "anomalies": "No anomalies are identifiable without the actual code content; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are evident from the prompt.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform a detailed step-by-step analysis. The code snippet or content was not provided, preventing identification of data sources, sinks, flows, or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "No concrete evidence of malicious behavior or security risks can be determined without examining the actual code. Based on the absence of provided code, the likelihood of malicious intent appears low, but a detailed review is not possible.",
