  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and obfuscation patterns.",
  "sources": "Potential data input points such as environment variables, network requests, user inputs, and code execution functions like 'eval' or 'exec'.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) through processing functions to sinks (network, file system).",
  "anomalies": "Presence of 'eval' or 'exec', hardcoded credentials or URLs, obfuscation, complex code paths, or suspicious dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code contains indicators such as 'eval', hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and complex control flows, which are typical signs of malicious intent. The suspicion is supported by high confidence scores (0.9), malware likelihood (0.75), and security risk (0.8). Other reports describe benign code with no suspicious features, aligning with low scores. Without actual code snippets, the assessment relies on the provided descriptions, but the reasoning and scoring are consistent with standard security evaluation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The first report's high scores are justified if the described malicious features are present. The other reports correctly assign low or zero scores based on benign descriptions. Overall, the scoring aligns with the reported features and reasoning, indicating a moderate to high risk primarily driven by the first report.",
