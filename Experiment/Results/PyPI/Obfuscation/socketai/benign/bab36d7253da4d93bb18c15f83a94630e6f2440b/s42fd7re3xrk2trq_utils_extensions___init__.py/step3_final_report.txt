{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function to find distinct elements in an array and declares variables with type annotations.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code is declarative.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains incomplete syntax ('distinct a array') and minimal context; variable names are arbitrary but benign. No malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a fragment or pseudocode with no executable logic. It defines a utility function and type annotations without any data processing, I/O, or network activity. The syntax issues and minimal structure suggest it's either incomplete or illustrative. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation level is moderate due to variable naming but does not imply malicious obfuscation. The overall security risk is negligible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The minimal and incomplete nature indicates it is likely a utility or placeholder fragment. The security scores should reflect a safe status, with malware at 0, low obfuscation, and minimal risk.",
