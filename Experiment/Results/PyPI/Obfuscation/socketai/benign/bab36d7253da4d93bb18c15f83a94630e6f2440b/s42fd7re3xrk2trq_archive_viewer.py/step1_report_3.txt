  "flows": "Data flows from archive files into internal structures; no external data flow or network communication evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to be a straightforward utility function.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet describes a viewer utility for archives, with an emphasis on recursive listing and a check for understanding the file object. It appears to be a standard, safe file handling and viewing function, with no indications of malicious behavior or malicious code constructs. The description lacks any suspicious operations such as network access, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided description, the code appears to be a benign archive viewer intended for testing purposes. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is evident.",
