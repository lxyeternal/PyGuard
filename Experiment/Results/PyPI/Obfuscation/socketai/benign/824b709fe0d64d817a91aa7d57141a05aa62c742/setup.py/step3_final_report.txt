{
  "purpose": "This code is a standard Python package setup script that reads the README.md file and configures package metadata using setuptools. It does not perform any dynamic code execution or external data handling.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Reads static file content into variables used solely for setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names are used, which is unusual but superficial; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical setup operation for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names that do not impact functionality or security. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of secrets is present. Malware scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent. Security risk scores are very low, justified by the benign nature of the code. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not suggest malicious intent. The code is consistent across multiple reports, all indicating a safe, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malware, vulnerabilities, or malicious behavior are evident. The obfuscation does not compromise security, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
