  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'onemetric' to distribute a metrics library for machine learning.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description content.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "Reading the README.md file (source) to populate the package description (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and unconventional, but they are consistent and do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. No suspicious code execution or network operations are present. The code appears to be standard package setup with obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'pathlib' and 'setuptools' for package setup. It reads 'README.md' content to use as a long description. The setup parameters are typical for Python packaging, specifying package metadata, dependencies, and classifiers. No external input processing or untrusted data handling occurs. Variable names are obfuscated, which is unusual but not malicious. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code execution, or credential handling, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risk detected. The code serves its purpose of packaging a Python project safely.",
