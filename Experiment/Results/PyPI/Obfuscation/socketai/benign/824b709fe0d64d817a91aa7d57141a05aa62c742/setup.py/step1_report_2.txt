  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'onemetric' Python package, used to configure package metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file for the long description; uses hardcoded package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Reads file content (source) for package description; no data flows into dangerous functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; use of non-descriptive identifiers. No suspicious logic or code injection present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py file that uses 'setuptools' to configure package installation. It reads the README.md to populate long_description, then calls 'setuptools.setup()' with static metadata and dependencies. No code execution based on external or untrusted input, no network activity, no credential handling, or code injection detected. The variable names are obfuscated but do not imply malicious intent; they appear as random strings likely used to obscure code structure. Overall, this appears as standard package setup code with no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for Python packaging with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names are likely an attempt at code obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent. No external data or secrets are accessed or transmitted.",
