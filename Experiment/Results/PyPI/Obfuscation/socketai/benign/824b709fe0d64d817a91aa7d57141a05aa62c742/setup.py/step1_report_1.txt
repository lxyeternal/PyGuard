  "sinks": "None present; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md content into setup configuration; no data flow to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., ZaWsXINKasgwREogQqYFqjiPREmMGvHO, guJpIKZGhGvBUdXoAhEHGsjZStpfVLPC) which could indicate an attempt to obscure intent. However, they are simply used for file path and content reading; no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs standard setup operations using setuptools, reading a README file to include as long description. The variable names are unusual but do not impact security. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not execute any external or untrusted code, nor does it handle sensitive data insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "This appears to be a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names that do not imply malicious intent. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
