  "conclusion": "The most suspicious reports (1 and 2) are justified with high malware and obfuscation scores, consistent with their descriptions. Slightly reducing the malware score in Report 2 from 0.4 to 0.3–0.4 aligns better with cautious analysis. Benign reports (3, 4, 5) correctly have zero or minimal scores. Overall, the scores are appropriate and reflect the described behaviors, with minor adjustments to better match the evidence."
