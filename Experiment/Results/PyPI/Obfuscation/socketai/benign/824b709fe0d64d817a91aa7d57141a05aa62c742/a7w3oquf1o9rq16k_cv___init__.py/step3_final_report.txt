  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Use of eval(), exec(), dynamic imports, hardcoded URLs/credentials, environment variables, input functions.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (sending data, connecting to domains), file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources like eval()/exec() leading to network or file operations, hardcoded secrets used in network connections or file writes, obfuscated variables obscuring data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic imports, suspicious network addresses, inconsistent or overly complex control flow, hardcoded credentials or URLs.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical indicators of malicious intent. High confidence in suspicion is justified if such patterns are confirmed. The presence of hardcoded secrets and obfuscated constructs increases risk. Minimal or no suspicious behavior suggests benign code. The scores should reflect the degree of suspicion, with higher scores for confirmed anomalies. The overall assessment indicates that reports with high dynamic code usage and obfuscation merit malware scores around 0.7, obfuscation around 0.75, and security risk around 0.8. For ambiguous or benign code, scores should be lowered accordingly.",
  "conclusion": "The most suspicious reports (1 and 2) are justified with high malware and obfuscation scores, consistent with their descriptions. Slightly reducing the malware score in Report 2 from 0.4 to 0.3–0.4 aligns better with cautious analysis. Benign reports (3, 4, 5) correctly have zero or minimal scores. Overall, the scores are appropriate and reflect the described behaviors, with minor adjustments to better match the evidence.",
