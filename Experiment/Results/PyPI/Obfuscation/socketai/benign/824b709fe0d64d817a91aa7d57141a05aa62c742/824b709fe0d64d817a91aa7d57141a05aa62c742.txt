The high obfuscation score reflects variable name obscurity but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code poses low security risk and is safe for use in trusted environments."

      "conclusion": "The most suspicious reports (1 and 2) are justified with high malware and obfuscation scores, consistent with their descriptions. Slightly reducing the malware score in Report 2 from 0.4 to 0.3–0.4 aligns better with cautious analysis. Benign reports (3, 4, 5) correctly have zero or minimal scores. Overall, the scores are appropriate and reflect the described behaviors, with minor adjustments to better match the evidence."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily for plotting object detection evaluation metrics. The suspicious import statement and obfuscated variable names suggest obfuscation but do not indicate malicious activity. No signs of malware, network activity, or system harm are present. The overall security risk is low, with the main concern being obfuscation that warrants further review."

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and suspicious import statements that could be used to hide malicious behavior. While no active malicious actions are observed in the static code, the obfuscation and import anomalies justify a moderate to high malware suspicion. The overall security risk is also elevated due to potential concealment. Further dynamic analysis and deobfuscation are recommended before deployment."

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, which raises suspicion but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The internal detection routines seem legitimate, but the obfuscation could be used to hide malicious behavior. Further investigation into external dependencies and de-obfuscation is recommended before deployment."
