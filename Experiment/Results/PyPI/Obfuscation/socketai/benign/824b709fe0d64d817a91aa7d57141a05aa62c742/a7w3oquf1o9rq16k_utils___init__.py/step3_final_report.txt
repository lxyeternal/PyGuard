  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign utility script handling data processing tasks without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and user inputs, if any, but no suspicious sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data reaches network connections, system commands, or sensitive files in a suspicious manner.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions without passing to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard data handling routines. No obfuscation, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious patterns are present. The confidence in benign nature is high (0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The low security risk score (0.2) and malware score (0) are justified.",
