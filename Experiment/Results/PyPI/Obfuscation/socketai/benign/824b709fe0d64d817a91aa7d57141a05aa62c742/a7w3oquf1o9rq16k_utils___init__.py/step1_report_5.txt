{
  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize and configure a web scraping or automation tool using Selenium WebDriver, likely for data extraction or automated browsing tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables (e.g., 'CHROMEDRIVER_PATH') and URL inputs provided at runtime or from external sources such as user input or configuration files.",
  "sinks": "The code interacts with the system environment (via environment variables), executes WebDriver commands, and possibly transmits data over network connections through Selenium's remote browser commands or network activities triggered during browsing.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> WebDriver setup -> Navigation commands -> Potential data extraction or network requests during browsing sessions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. The code does not contain obfuscated parts or unusual constructs. No suspicious network connections or data exfiltration signals are evident from the provided code segment.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up a Selenium WebDriver session using user-defined or environment-provided paths and options. It configures browser options such as headless mode, ignores SSL errors, and manages driver initialization. The flow is straightforward: environment variables or parameters provide inputs, which are then used for browser automation tasks. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code seems to be a typical automation script without suspicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard automation setup script. The risk score is low, with no malicious signals detected.",
