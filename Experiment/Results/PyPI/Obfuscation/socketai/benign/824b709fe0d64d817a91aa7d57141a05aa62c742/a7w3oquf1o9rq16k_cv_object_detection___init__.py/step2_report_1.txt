  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code snippets, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe import statements from local modules.\n- Function names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads is present.\n- The code snippets are minimal, only performing imports without further logic.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly notes the obfuscation and lack of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 — low, justified by obfuscation but no evident threat.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6, reasonable given the limited context.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment seems sound. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes obfuscation without malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0, appropriate given the lack of suspicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6, reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The report is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Again, notes obfuscation, no external data flow, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0, appropriate.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, consistent with the obfuscation concern but no actual threat.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6, suitable.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Similar observations; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Malware score:** 0, aligns with the description.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2, justified by obfuscation.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6, appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly identifies benign import statements with obfuscated names.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent.\n- **Risk score:** 0, justified.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, slightly higher but still reasonable given the consistent pattern.\n\n**Verdict:** No adjustments needed.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Assessment**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Slightly high (0.7–0.8), reflecting the unusual naming but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Risk scores:** Low (0.2–0.3), justified given the obfuscation but no actual threat.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across all, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7, considering the consistent obfuscation pattern.\n- **Risk:** 0.2, acknowledging obfuscation but no active threat.\n\n**Final note:** The import statements alone do not indicate malicious intent, but obfuscation warrants cautious review of the overall package. The scores are appropriately conservative.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and justified. No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.",
