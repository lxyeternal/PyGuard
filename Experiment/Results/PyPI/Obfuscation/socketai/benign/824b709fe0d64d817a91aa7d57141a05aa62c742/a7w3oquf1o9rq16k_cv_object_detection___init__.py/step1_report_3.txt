  "purpose": "Import specific functions from local modules related to average precision and confusion matrix calculations.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing functions from local modules: 'average_precision', 'confusion_matrix', and 'mean_average_precision'.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks observed; the code only performs imports.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; imports are static and do not process runtime data.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated and appear as random strings, which is unusual for standard function naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions with highly obfuscated names from local modules, which may indicate an attempt to conceal functionality or malicious intent. However, since these are local imports, there is no immediate evidence of malicious behavior or external data exfiltration. The obfuscated function names are suspicious but not conclusive proof of malicious intent. The code is minimal and does not execute any additional logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard import operations but uses obfuscated function names, which could be suspicious. No direct malicious activity or data leaks are evident from these lines alone. The suspicious naming warrants further review of the module contents, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious behavior is confirmed.",
