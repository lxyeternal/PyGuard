  "purpose": "Import specific functions from local modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load functions from relative modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external network interactions present.",
  "flows": "Import statements do not involve data flow or source-to-sink data paths.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated and consist of nonsensical strings, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions with obfuscated names from local modules. No external data sources, user inputs, or network interactions are evident. The obfuscated function names could indicate attempts at hiding functionality, but without additional code, this cannot be confirmed as malicious. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The pattern appears to be an obfuscated or intentionally obscure naming scheme, which might be for legitimate purposes or to conceal malicious intent, but based solely on these import statements, no malicious activity is detectable.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated function names from local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within these snippets. The obfuscation might warrant further review if additional context reveals malicious intent, but based on this fragment alone, it appears benign.",
