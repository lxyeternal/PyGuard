{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions from local modules, likely for use in calculations related to precision and confusion matrices.",
  "sources": "The import statements indicate data sources are the module files 'average_precision', 'confusion_matrix', and 'mean_average_precision'.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any explicit data sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access. It only imports functions.",
  "flows": "There are no direct data flows from source to sink; the code only imports functions without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function names are obfuscated or nonsensical, suggesting they are intentionally named with random strings. The modules themselves are local, but the function names appear deliberately obscure and do not resemble standard naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three import statements importing functions with highly obfuscated names from local modules. The obfuscation of function names is unusual and could be a sign of attempt to hide functionality or malicious intent. However, the code itself does not perform any actions beyond importing. No suspicious data handling, network activity, or sensitive data access is evident. Without additional context or execution code, the purpose appears to be setting up for further operations, but the naming raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The code only imports functions with obfuscated names, which is unusual but does not directly indicate malicious behavior. The lack of additional code limits the ability to confirm malicious intent, but the obfuscated naming warrants caution. Overall, no explicit malicious activity is detected at this stage.",
