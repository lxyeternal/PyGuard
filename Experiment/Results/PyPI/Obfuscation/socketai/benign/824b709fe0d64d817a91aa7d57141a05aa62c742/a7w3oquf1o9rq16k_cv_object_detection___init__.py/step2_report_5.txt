  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and overall security implications.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe import statements from local modules with obfuscated function names.\n- No evidence of external network activity, data exfiltration, or runtime malicious behavior is presented.\n- The obfuscation of function names is consistent, but obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded secrets, suspicious code patterns, or other indicators of compromise are identified.\n- The code snippets are minimal, making it difficult to determine overall intent without additional context.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue Presence and Code Analysis**\n\n- The **original code** only contains import statements; no functions, data flows, or other logic are present.\n- The reports' assessments about obfuscated function names are accurate; obfuscation is unusual but not inherently malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, malicious payloads, or security risks is detected in these snippets.\n\n---\n\n### **Score Review and Justification**\n\n#### **Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of **0**.\n- This is appropriate given the lack of evidence of malicious activity.\n- **No changes needed.**\n\n#### **Obfuscated Score:**\n- Reports assign obfuscated scores between **0.7 and 0.8**.\n- Given the obfuscated function names, this seems reasonable.\n- **No changes needed.**\n\n#### **Security Risk Score:**\n- Ranges from **0** to **0.2**.\n- Since only import statements are present, and no suspicious behavior is observed, these scores are justified.\n- Slightly higher in some reports (0.2), possibly due to the obfuscation.\n- **No changes needed.**\n\n#### **Overall Risk and Scores:**\n- The scores are consistent with the observed minimal code and lack of malicious activity.\n- The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but not confirmed malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Potential Concerns and Recommendations**\n\n- The obfuscation warrants further review of the full package to ensure no malicious code is hidden elsewhere.\n- The reports correctly identify the obfuscation but do not overstate the risk given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary and Personal Assessment**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.75 (average of reported values, justified)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (consistent with minimal code and no malicious activity)\n\n**Overall, the current scores are reasonable and justified based on the provided snippets.**  \nFurther review of the entire package is recommended to confirm that no malicious payloads are hidden elsewhere.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their observations. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute evidence of malicious activity. The scores reflect this appropriately. No adjustments are necessary unless additional code reveals malicious behavior.",
