{
  "purpose": "Importing functions with obfuscated names from local modules, likely for internal use or as part of a larger package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .average_precision, .confusion_matrix, .mean_average_precision",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; code only performs imports without further data handling.",
  "flows": "Import statements load functions into the namespace; no data flow or external communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules with obfuscated function names. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation of function names raises suspicion but could be due to code obfuscation or automated generation. The malware score is correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), justified by the unusual naming. The security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the minimal code and lack of external threats. Confidence in these assessments is moderate (~0.6-0.9), given the limited context. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation as the primary concern, warranting further review of the entire package but not indicating malicious activity based solely on these snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The import statements are benign, with obfuscated function names raising suspicion but no evidence of malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code provided. Further review of the full package is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious logic.",
