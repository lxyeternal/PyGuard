{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from local modules related to average precision and confusion matrix calculations, likely for use in machine learning evaluation.",
  "sources": "Import statements retrieving functions from internal modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or external communication evident in this fragment",
  "flows": "N/A in this isolated snippet; no data flow, only imports",
  "anomalies": "Function names appear obfuscated with random strings, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three import statements from relative modules, importing functions with highly obfuscated names. The obfuscation could be a result of code generation or packaging, not necessarily malicious. No suspicious activity, network communication, or malicious payloads are present. The code is minimal and focused on importing functions, which suggests typical usage in a larger context. No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, primarily importing functions from local modules with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this fragment.",
