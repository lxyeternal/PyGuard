{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules related to average precision and confusion matrix calculations.",
  "sources": "Module imports from local package files: average_precision, confusion_matrix, mean_average_precision.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only imports functions/classes without further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Imported function names are obfuscated or appear as random strings, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions from local modules using obfuscated names, which could suggest either code obfuscation or an attempt to hide functionality. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code is minimal, focusing solely on imports, making it difficult to determine intent beyond the obfuscation pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard import statements with obfuscated identifiers, likely to hinder readability. There is no clear evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review of the overall package context.",
