  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, which raises suspicion but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The internal detection routines seem legitimate, but the obfuscation could be used to hide malicious behavior. Further investigation into external dependencies and de-obfuscation is recommended before deployment."
