{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, visualization, and statistical analysis related to object detection or classification tasks, including generating heatmaps and calculating metrics for model evaluation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters, especially numpy arrays representing features, predictions, and labels. Also imports data from external modules, but no user input or network data is read.",
  "sinks": "Outputs visualizations saved to files via plt.savefig, but does not send data externally or perform network operations. No database or file system writes besides saving figures are observed.",
  "flows": "Processes input arrays through various methods, normalizes data, generates heatmaps, and computes statistical matrices. No untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks like network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "The initial import statement uses an obscure, non-standard feature import from __future__, which is unusual but not malicious. Variable and class names are obfuscated, making understanding difficult but not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The import of potentially external or proprietary modules (onemetric.*) could be legitimate or malicious, but their presence alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code does contain complex, opaque data processing steps and a function that raises an exception for class index validation, which might be suspicious if manipulated, but nothing explicitly malicious is present.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated with non-descriptive names, which impairs readability but does not imply malicious behavior. It performs data normalization, visualization with heatmaps, and statistical analysis, typical for model evaluation. No external network communication, file access outside saving plots, or code injections are present. The use of obscure import statements and obfuscated class/method names suggests either intentional concealment or code complexity, but no active malicious actions such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system manipulation are detected. The presence of validation and data processing routines appears legitimate and aligned with model evaluation workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex data processing and visualization module, likely for evaluating object detection or classification models. Despite obfuscated naming, it does not contain any clear malicious behavior or malware. The code could be part of a larger, legitimate system. No signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, system harm, or network attacks are evident.",
