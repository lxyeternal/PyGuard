  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning behind the scores, and consistency with the code content.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that the code relates to metrics, visualization, and bounding box analysis, matching the code's functions.\n- **Anomalies:** Correctly notes the suspicious import from `__future__` with an invalid feature name, which is a red flag. The obfuscated class and variable names also suggest obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately points out that while the code appears to perform legitimate data processing, the obfuscation and suspicious import raise concerns. The report assigns a **malware score of 0.4**, indicating moderate suspicion, which seems reasonable given the obfuscation but no explicit malicious activity.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- The obfuscated import and naming are red flags but do not confirm malicious behavior.  \n- The reasoning aligns with the code's content, which is complex but does not show direct malicious actions.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Keep the malware score at 0.4, but consider raising it if further analysis of imported modules or runtime behavior suggests hidden malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the code as handling data processing and visualization, with obfuscated names and suspicious import statements.\n- **Anomalies:** Highlights the invalid `__future__` import, which is a strong indicator of obfuscation or corruption.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no explicit malicious activity but notes obfuscation and potential concealment. Assigns a **malware score of 0.1**, indicating low suspicion.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Given the lack of evidence for malicious activity, a low malware score is appropriate.\n- The obfuscation alone does not imply malware, but warrants caution.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The malware score seems reasonable; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that the code is for data analysis and visualization, with no external network or system modifications.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the invalid import from `__future__`, obfuscated names, but finds no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately assesses that the code is typical for model evaluation, with obfuscation as a concern but no active malicious signs. Assigns a **malware score of 0.0**, which is justified.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- No evidence of malware, malicious data flow, or harmful commands.\n- Obfuscation alone does not equate to malware.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Scores are consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to previous, with focus on data visualization and evaluation.\n- **Anomalies:** Again mentions the invalid `__future__` import and obfuscated names.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious activity, only obfuscation. Assigns a **malware score of 0.2**, slightly higher but still low.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- Slightly higher suspicion due to obfuscation, but no concrete malicious actions observed.\n- The external modules could be benign or malicious, but without evidence, the low malware score is justified.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- The malware score appears appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as data processing and visualization.\n- **Anomalies:** Notes the suspicious import from `__future__` with a nonsensical feature name, consistent with previous observations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no malicious behavior, only obfuscation, and assigns a **malware score of 0.1**.\n\n**Score justification:**  \n- The lack of malicious activity supports a low malware score.\n- Obfuscation alone warrants caution but not high suspicion.\n\n**Recommendation:**  \n- Scores are consistent; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All are low (0.1 to 0.4), reflecting suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and suspicious import statements, but no evidence of active malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** High (0.7 to 0.8), consistent with the obfuscated variable names and suspicious import.\n- **Risk Scores:** Moderate to low, aligning with the suspicion level.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- Based on the analysis, I would assign a **malware score of approximately 0.2**. The obfuscation and suspicious import are red flags but do not confirm malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- The obfuscation is significant; I would rate it around **0.8**.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Given the obfuscation and suspicious import but no concrete malicious actions, a **risk score of about 0.5** seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Estimated Value |\n|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware         | **0.2**         |\n| Obfuscated      | **0.8**         |\n| Risk            | **0.5**         |\n\nThis balanced assessment reflects the suspicion raised by obfuscation and invalid import but acknowledges the lack of concrete malicious activity.",
