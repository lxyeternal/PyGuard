{
  "purpose": "The code performs data processing, visualization, and evaluation metrics for model performance, involving numpy arrays, matplotlib, seaborn, and external utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data from numpy arrays and lists; external functions from 'onemetric' modules.",
  "sinks": "Visualization outputs saved as figures; no network or file system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows through normalization, aggregation, and visualization routines; external functions process data but their behavior is unknown.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement from __future__ with an invalid feature name ('QIHHfthuwQRiSEsUVLgUmiztoeRaQxDT') is syntactically invalid in Python, indicating obfuscation or placeholder code. Variable and class names are heavily obfuscated, which may conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code's core functions involve data normalization, heatmap plotting, and detection metrics calculation. The suspicious import from __future__ with a nonsensical feature name is a strong red flag for obfuscation or malicious intent. The obfuscated variable and class names further suggest concealment. External functions are imported but their implementations are unknown; they could be benign utilities or malicious hooks. No network activity, file modifications, or system commands are present in the static code. The heavy obfuscation and invalid import indicate potential concealment of malicious behavior, but no explicit malicious commands are evident in the static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and suspicious import statements that could be used to hide malicious behavior. While no active malicious actions are observed in the static code, the obfuscation and import anomalies justify a moderate to high malware suspicion. The overall security risk is also elevated due to potential concealment. Further dynamic analysis and deobfuscation are recommended before deployment.",
