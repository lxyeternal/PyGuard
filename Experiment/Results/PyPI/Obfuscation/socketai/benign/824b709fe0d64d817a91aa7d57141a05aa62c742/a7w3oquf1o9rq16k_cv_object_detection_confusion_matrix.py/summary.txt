  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and suspicious import statements that could be used to hide malicious behavior. While no active malicious actions are observed in the static code, the obfuscation and import anomalies justify a moderate to high malware suspicion. The overall security risk is also elevated due to potential concealment. Further dynamic analysis and deobfuscation are recommended before deployment."
