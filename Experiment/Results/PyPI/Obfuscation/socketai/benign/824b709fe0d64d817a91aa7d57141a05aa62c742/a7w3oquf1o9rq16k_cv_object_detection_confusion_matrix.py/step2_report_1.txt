  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data processing, visualization, metrics; inputs include numpy arrays, lists, external modules.\n- **Anomalies:** The import statement from `__future__` with an invalid feature name (`QIHHfthuwQRiSEsUVLgUmiztoeRaQxDT`) is suspicious. Obfuscated class and variable names suggest obfuscation or concealment.\n- **Analysis:** The code performs data normalization, visualization, and complex data manipulations. The imported functions `sodgoGymOeWjisKrUflfkSHuRMnLvVkK` and `cPuGcHyUuHNKLMGTAYsKyEellIxSIfAs` are external, with unknown implementations, which could be malicious if they perform hidden actions.\n- **Conclusion:** Heavy obfuscation, suspicious import, and no explicit malicious commands. The risk score of 0.6 and malware score of 0.4 seem aligned with these red flags. The obfuscation score of 0.8 is justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data processing, visualization, evaluation metrics; obfuscated class and function names.\n- **Anomalies:** The `__future__` import with a non-standard feature name (`QIHHfthuwQRiSEsUVLgUmiztoeRaQxDT`) is invalid, indicating obfuscation or corruption.\n- **Analysis:** The code handles detection metrics, with no network or system modifications. Obfuscation is present but no direct malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** The obfuscation is high, but the malware score of 0.1 and risk of 0.2 are reasonable. The code appears to be primarily for data evaluation with no evident malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data analysis, visualization, statistical analysis; input arrays.\n- **Anomalies:** The invalid `__future__` import with a nonsensical feature name. Obfuscated variable names.\n- **Analysis:** Performs standard data normalization and visualization, with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscation might be to conceal complexity or proprietary code.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score of 0.0 and risk score of 0.2 are appropriate. Obfuscation is high but not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Model evaluation, heatmaps, confusion matrices; input data from arrays.\n- **Anomalies:** The import from `__future__` with an invalid feature name (`QIHHfthuwQRiSEsUVLgUmiztoeRaQxDT`). Heavy obfuscation.\n- **Analysis:** The code is for data visualization and metrics, with no network or system commands. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious code, but none is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score of 0.2 is slightly higher but acceptable given obfuscation. Overall, it seems to be a legitimate evaluation module.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Data processing, visualization, metrics; input arrays.\n- **Anomalies:** Same invalid `__future__` import with a nonsensical feature name. Obfuscated variable names.\n- **Analysis:** Performs standard visualization and data validation. No malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score of 0.1 and risk score of 0.2 are justified. Obfuscation appears to be a red herring or proprietary concealment.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- The **common red flag** across all reports is the `__future__` import with an invalid feature name (`QIHHfthuwQRiSEsUVLgUmiztoeRaQxDT`). This is **not valid Python syntax** and suggests obfuscation or placeholder code.\n- The code is heavily obfuscated with nonsensical class and variable names, which can be used to hide malicious behavior.\n- The functions imported from `onemetric` modules are unknown; they could be benign utility functions or malicious hooks.\n- No network activity, file system manipulation, or explicit malicious commands are observed in the static code snippets.\n- The core logic appears to be data processing, visualization, and evaluation, which are typical in ML workflows.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The suspicious import statement warrants a higher malware suspicion, especially if the code is executed. It could be a placeholder or an attempt to bypass static analysis.\n- The obfuscation and unusual import strongly suggest caution.\n- Without inspecting the external modules or executing the code, it's impossible to confirm malicious activity definitively.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Estimated Scores:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score (0-1) | Justification                                                                                 |\n|-------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**      | **0.5**      | The invalid `__future__` import and obfuscation are red flags; potential for hidden malicious code. The code could be benign but warrants caution. |\n| **Obfuscated**   | **0.8**      | Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical names and invalid import statement.                     |\n| **Risk**         | **0.6**      | Moderate to high risk due to obfuscation and suspicious import, but no direct malicious actions observed. |\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code exhibits signs of obfuscation and suspicious import statements that are invalid in standard Python, indicating potential concealment of malicious behavior. While the core functionality appears to be data visualization and evaluation, the obfuscation and import anomalies justify a cautious malware score of around 0.5 and a high obfuscation score. Further investigation into external modules and runtime behavior is recommended before deployment or further analysis.",
