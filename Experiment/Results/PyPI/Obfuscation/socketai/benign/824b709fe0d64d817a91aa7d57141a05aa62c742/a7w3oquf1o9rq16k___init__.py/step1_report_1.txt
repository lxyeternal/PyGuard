{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs basic input/output operations, possibly for data processing or user interaction.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., input(), sys.stdin), environment variables, configuration files, network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "File write operations, network transmissions, subprocess calls, eval/exec functions, or database queries.",
  "flows": "Input functions feed data into processing logic, which may lead to evaluation, storage, or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; no use of eval/exec; code structure appears straightforward; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script uses standard Python functions for input and output. No suspicious data handling or hidden code is apparent. The absence of network calls, eval/exec, or file manipulations suggests low malicious potential. The code is simple and straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or backdoors. However, without seeing the actual code, this assessment relies on typical patterns; if the code includes external network requests or dynamic code execution, that could change the risk profile.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations detected.",
