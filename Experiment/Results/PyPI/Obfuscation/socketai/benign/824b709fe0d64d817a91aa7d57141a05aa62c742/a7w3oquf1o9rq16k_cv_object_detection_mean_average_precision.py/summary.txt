  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for plotting object detection evaluation metrics. The suspicious import statement and obfuscated variable names suggest obfuscation but do not indicate malicious activity. No signs of malware, network activity, or system harm are present. The overall security risk is low, with the main concern being obfuscation that warrants further review."
