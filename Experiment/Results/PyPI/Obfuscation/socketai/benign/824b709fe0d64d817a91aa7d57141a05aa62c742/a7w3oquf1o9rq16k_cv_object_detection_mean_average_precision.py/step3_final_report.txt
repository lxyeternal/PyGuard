  "purpose": "Visualization of object detection evaluation metrics, specifically precision-recall curves.",
  "sources": "Input numpy arrays, class names, and internal data structures within the class method.",
  "sinks": "Matplotlib plotting functions that generate and save the evaluation plot image.",
  "flows": "Data is processed from input arrays to compute average precision metrics, then plotted on a figure, with labels and legends added before saving.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement from __future__ with an invalid feature 'QIHHfthuwQRiSEsUVLgUmiztoeRaQxDT' is nonsensical and invalid in Python, indicating obfuscation or placeholder code. Variable names are obscure and some variables are undefined, suggesting obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a dataclass for storing evaluation metrics, with a class method to instantiate it from lists of numpy arrays, averaging some values. The plotting method creates a figure, plots multiple detection curves, customizes axes and legend, and saves the figure. The suspicious import line from __future__ with a nonsensical feature indicates obfuscation. Variable names are intentionally obscure, and some variables are undefined, which suggests the code may be obfuscated or incomplete. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The core functionality is benign visualization, with obfuscation as the main concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for plotting object detection evaluation metrics. The suspicious import statement and obfuscated variable names suggest obfuscation but do not indicate malicious activity. No signs of malware, network activity, or system harm are present. The overall security risk is low, with the main concern being obfuscation that warrants further review.",
