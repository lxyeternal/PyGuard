{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to list files with specific extensions in a given directory and read lines from a specified file, returning non-empty lines.",
  "sources": "os.listdir (reads directory contents), open (reads file contents)",
  "sinks": "open file reading, list comprehensions processing data",
  "flows": "os.listdir provides filenames → filtering with endswith → reading file contents with open → processing lines",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names; no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious domain or IP connections, no obfuscated code, no embedded malicious commands.",
  "analysis": "The functions perform straightforward file system operations: listing directory contents and reading text files. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no evidence of data exfiltration or backdoors. The code's behavior appears typical for file handling and filtering. No anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard directory and file processing without malicious intent or security risks.",
