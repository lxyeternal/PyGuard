  "purpose": "Assign a string value 'object_pk' to a variable named ieLXtJDrgqpErUiCipbuNyAtFORXarhS.",
  "sources": "Variable assignment; no external input or data sources used.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no meaningful context or operations. No malicious code or logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a static string to a variable with a seemingly random name. There are no external inputs, no data manipulation, no network operations, no use of environment variables, or suspicious function calls. The variable name looks obfuscated, but this alone is not indicative of malicious intent; it could be part of a larger obfuscated codebase or a simple variable name. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward variable assignment with no malicious behavior, no security risks, and no obfuscation that suggests malicious intent beyond basic obfuscation. It appears benign.",
