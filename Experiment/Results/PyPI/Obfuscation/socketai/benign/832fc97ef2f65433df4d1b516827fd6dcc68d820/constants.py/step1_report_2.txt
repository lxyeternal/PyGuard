  "purpose": "Assignment of the string 'object_pk' to a variable named 'ieLXtJDrgqpErUiCipbuNyAtFORXarhS'.",
  "sources": "The string literal 'object_pk' assigned directly to the variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a string 'object_pk' to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no external inputs, no data processing, no function calls, or network operations. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated but does not perform any malicious activity. The code is straightforward and lacks any signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign; it performs a simple variable assignment with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
