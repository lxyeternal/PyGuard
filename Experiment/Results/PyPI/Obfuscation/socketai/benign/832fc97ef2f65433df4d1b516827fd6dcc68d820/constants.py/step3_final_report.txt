{
  "purpose": "Assigns the string 'object_pk' to a variable with an obfuscated name, likely as a placeholder or identifier.",
  "sources": "No external inputs, data flows, or data sources; the code is a direct string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects; no external communication or data processing.",
  "flows": "Simple source-to-sink: the string 'object_pk' assigned to a variable; no further data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no malicious code, no data exfiltration, no network activity; the code is minimal and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No external inputs, no network activity, and no malicious logic are present. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risk scores. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.2), reflecting superficial obfuscation without malicious purpose. Confidence in benign assessment is high (around 0.9).",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation is superficial and typical of minified or auto-generated code. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating no malware and minimal security concern.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.2,
