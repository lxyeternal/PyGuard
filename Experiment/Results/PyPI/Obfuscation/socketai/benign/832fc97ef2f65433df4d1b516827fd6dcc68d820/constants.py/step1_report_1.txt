{
  "purpose": "The code assigns a string value 'object_pk' to a variable with a seemingly random name.",
  "sources": "Assignment operation assigning a string literal to a variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only initializes a variable",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which can be suspicious, but the code itself is simple",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with an unusual variable name. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or suspicious control flow. The variable name may be obfuscated or autogenerated, which is common in minimized or obfuscated code but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. No external input, network activity, or secret handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malicious code or security risks based on this snippet.",
