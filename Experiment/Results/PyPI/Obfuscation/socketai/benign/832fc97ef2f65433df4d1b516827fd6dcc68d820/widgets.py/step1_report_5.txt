{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Django form widgets and a Wagtail widget adapter for an instance selector feature, likely used for selecting model instances within a Wagtail admin interface.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters in methods like gEpvBgaHzIgruALIcgIumjpVOFmsXUsQ, arGUOXsDtLBmwzPpKcErdZyrDKwayHAx, jqLNrCWyPxAxhXAYykBenXLwAlGTItuQ, and in the constructor; accesses metadata and model instances; uses URL reversing and rendering templates.",
  "sinks": "Generates URLs with reverse(); uses json.dumps() to pass configuration to JavaScript; renders HTML templates; calls model retrieval methods; outputs JSON-like configuration strings.",
  "flows": "Input data (e.g., pk) flows through methods like gEpvBgaHzIgruALIcgIumjpVOFmsXUsQ and arGUOXsDtLBmwzPpKcErdZyrDKwayHAx, then into URL generation and rendering functions; URL and configuration data flow into front-end widget initialization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly obfuscated variable names; inclusion of constants from an imported module with unlikely names; rendering of a widget with dynamic URLs and embedding IDs; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; the code structure appears intentionally complex but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of a custom widget for a Django/Wagtail project, with functions generating URLs and rendering templates for an instance selector component. The variable and class names are obfuscated or auto-generated, which could suggest an attempt to hide intent. However, the logic involves typical URL reversal, model instance retrieval, and template rendering, with no signs of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors. The module imports and usage are consistent with Wagtail and Django best practices. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious external calls are present. The obfuscation seems to be a naming pattern rather than malicious code obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a custom Wagtail widget for selecting model instances, with no evident malicious behavior. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or a code-generation artifact rather than malicious intent. No indicators of malware or security risks were identified.",
