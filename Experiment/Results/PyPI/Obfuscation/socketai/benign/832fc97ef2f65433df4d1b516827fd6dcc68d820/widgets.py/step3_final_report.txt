{
  "purpose": "Defines custom Django/Wagtail widgets for instance selection, involving URL generation, rendering, and safe JSON embedding.",
  "sources": "Model metadata, widget parameters, URL reversal functions, template rendering inputs.",
  "sinks": "HTML/JavaScript embedded via render_to_string, URL endpoints generated by reverse, JSON data embedded with json.dumps.",
  "flows": "Data flows from widget initialization and model metadata into URL generation, template rendering, and JSON serialization, ultimately into HTML/JS output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, but no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or external network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard custom widgets for Django/Wagtail, with URL reversals, template rendering, and JSON serialization. Obfuscation appears stylistic or generated, not malicious. No external connections, secrets, or payloads are present. The data flow is typical for such widgets, and no vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation raises scores but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation of custom Django/Wagtail widgets with obfuscated naming. No malware or security risks are detected. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not imply malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
