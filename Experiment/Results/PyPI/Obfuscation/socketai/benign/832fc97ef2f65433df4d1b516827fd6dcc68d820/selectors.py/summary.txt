  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign Django UI components with obfuscated naming, likely for proprietary or obscurity reasons. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not elevate the risk score. The overall assessment aligns with the previous reports, confirming a low security threat."
