  "purpose": "Defines a subclass of a Django app class with obfuscated class and attribute names, setting attributes based on module name and a static string.",
  "sources": "The class name, the __name__ variable, and class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network calls, or untrusted inputs are used.",
  "flows": "Class definition reads __name__, assigns derived string to class attribute, sets static string to another attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; use of __name__ to construct strings; no external data or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a subclass of a Django app class with obfuscated naming. It constructs a string from __name__ by joining all parts except the last, and sets a static string attribute. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious behavior are present. The obfuscation appears to be for internal purposes or to hinder straightforward analysis but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.2-0.7), justified by the complex naming pattern. The security risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with benign internal configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated Django configuration class with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely for internal or placeholder purposes, and the overall security assessment is that it poses minimal risk.",
