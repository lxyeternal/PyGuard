  "purpose": "Register custom admin URLs and insert CSS/JS assets into the Django/Wagtail admin interface.",
  "sources": "static() calls for CSS and JS files; import statements; decorator registration functions.",
  "sinks": "format_html() function rendering HTML with static URLs.",
  "flows": "static() outputs to format_html(), which injects HTML into the admin interface.",
  "anomalies": "The function names are obfuscated, using seemingly random strings; no apparent dynamic code execution or hidden backdoors; imports are standard.",
  "analysis": "The code registers admin URL patterns and injects static assets into the admin UI using Django and Wagtail hooks. The use of obfuscated function names may be an attempt to conceal intent, but the actual code is straightforward and benign—loading static CSS and JavaScript files, and returning a URL list. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious network activity are present. The static assets are likely local files, and no user input is processed or passed to dangerous sinks. Overall, the code appears to serve a UI purpose without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily registering admin URLs and injecting static resources, with obfuscated function names but no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attacks. It is safe based on the provided fragment.",
