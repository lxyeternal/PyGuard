  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the findings.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- The code snippets are highly obfuscated: nonsensical function names and variable names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply code minification.\n- Static files are loaded via Django's `static()` function, which is standard.\n- The URL returned from `urls.duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl` is dynamic and imported from a module with an obfuscated name.\n- No user input or external network activity is evident.\n- The static assets are local, not external, reducing immediate risk.\n- The main concern is the obfuscation and dynamic URL handling, which could hide malicious endpoints or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Discrepancies:\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code functions as described: registering URLs and injecting static resources. The suspicious parts are the obfuscated names and dynamic URL retrieval, which are consistent with the reports.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No explicit coding errors are evident. The obfuscation is suspicious but not necessarily a flaw. The static resource inclusion is standard.\n\n- **Scores and their reasonableness:**  \n  - **Malware scores:**  \n    Most reports assign low malware scores (0.2 or 0), which aligns with the absence of direct malicious code. However, the first report assigns a malware score of 0.2 based on suspicion from obfuscation and dynamic URL handling.  \n  - **Security risk scores:**  \n    Generally low (0.1 - 0.4), consistent with static resource loading and no evident malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n\n- The **obfuscation** is a red flag, but not conclusive evidence of malicious intent. Obfuscation can be used to hide malicious code, but it can also be used to protect proprietary code or reduce readability.\n- The **dynamic URL** from an imported module with an obfuscated name could be benign or malicious, depending on its contents. Without inspecting `instance_selector.urls`, we cannot confirm.\n- The static files are local, reducing risk, but if the static files are compromised, they could serve malicious scripts. The code itself does not show any signs of malicious payloads.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Scores should remain cautious but not overly high.**  \n  The malware scores could stay around 0.2-0.3, reflecting suspicion but not confirmed malicious behavior.\n\n- **The overall security risk remains low** unless the contents of the imported `urls` module or static files are malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score | Justification                                                                                     |\n|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **Malware**       | **0.2**           | Based on obfuscation and dynamic URL; no explicit malicious code detected.                     |\n| **Obfuscated**    | **0.7**           | Obfuscated function names and variables are present across reports, indicating high obfuscation. |\n| **Risk**          | **0.3**           | Slight suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic URL, but static resources are local and safe. |\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- The code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to customizing the Django/Wagtail admin interface.\n- Obfuscation and dynamic URL handling are suspicious but not definitively malicious.\n- No direct evidence of malware, data exfiltration, or supply chain compromise is present.\n- **Further review of the `instance_selector.urls` module and static files is recommended** to confirm their safety.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain a cautious stance, with malware and obfuscated scores around 0.2-0.3, and overall security risk low unless further evidence emerges.",
