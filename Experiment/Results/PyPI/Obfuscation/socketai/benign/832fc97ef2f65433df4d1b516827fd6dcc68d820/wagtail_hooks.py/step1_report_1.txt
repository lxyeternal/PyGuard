{
  "purpose": "Register admin URLs and insert global CSS/JS for the Django admin interface related to an 'instance_selector' feature.",
  "sources": "The code reads static file paths via 'static()' function and URL from 'urls.duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl'.",
  "sinks": "Embedding static file links in HTML, which could potentially lead to resource manipulation if the static files are compromised.",
  "flows": "Static file paths are embedded into HTML for inclusion in admin pages; the URL from 'urls' is returned for registration.",
  "anomalies": "The function names are nonsensical and obfuscated, which may indicate an attempt to hide purpose. The 'urls' import and usage appear suspiciously dynamic, possibly hiding malicious URL redirection or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code registers admin URL endpoints and inserts CSS/JS into the admin interface, which is typical for customizing Django admin. The use of obfuscated function names and variable names (YHzjGNBrjXoMIMGLMzdyJaRMeVGPqenl, qgBNOGCuFDbNoecSJeDYhBEIHQxSdoxl, duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl) raises suspicion. The static files are standard but could be replaced with malicious scripts if the static files are compromised. The URL returned from 'urls.duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl' is an external or internal link that could be maliciously controlled, especially if the 'urls' module is malicious or compromised. Overall, the code appears obfuscated intentionally, potentially to hide malicious intent or backdoors, although nothing explicit like system commands or data exfiltration is directly visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated, with suspiciously named functions and variables, and dynamically returned URLs. It registers admin interface modifications, which could be benign or malicious depending on the contents of 'urls'. The static resources are standard but could be replaced maliciously if compromised. The overall risk is moderate, leaning toward suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic URL handling.",
