{
  "purpose": "The code registers admin URLs and injects static CSS/JS resources into the Django/Wagtail admin interface, with obfuscated function names and a dynamic URL source.",
  "sources": "The function returning 'urls.duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl' from the imported 'urls' module.",
  "sinks": "Embedding static resources via format_html, and returning a URL from the 'urls' module; no untrusted input or network activity evident.",
  "flows": "The code calls the 'urls' module to retrieve a URL, and injects static CSS/JS into the admin interface, with obfuscated functions acting as intermediaries.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; dynamic URL source from an imported module; static files loaded locally but could be compromised; no direct malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code registers admin URLs and injects static resources with obfuscated identifiers, which could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent or simply code minification. The static files are local, reducing immediate risk, but the dynamic URL from an imported 'urls' module with obfuscated naming warrants scrutiny. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation and dynamic URL handling are suspicious but not conclusive of malicious behavior. The static resources are standard, and the code functions as a typical Wagtail extension. The overall risk is low, but the source of the 'urls' module and static files should be verified to ensure integrity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django/Wagtail admin extension with obfuscated naming. While obfuscation can be suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The static assets are local, and the dynamic URL source could be benign or malicious depending on its origin. Further verification of the 'urls' module and static files is recommended to confirm safety.",
