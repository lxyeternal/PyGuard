  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the code.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- Imports static file paths via `static()`.\n- Imports a URL variable from `instance_selector.urls`.\n- Registers a URL endpoint with a function returning `urls.duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl`.\n- Injects CSS and JS into the admin interface with obfuscated function names.\n- Uses format_html to embed static resources.\n\n---\n\n### **1. Issue Presence & Validity**\n\n- **Are the issues present?**  \n  The code clearly registers URLs and injects static resources, matching the reports. The obfuscated function names and dynamic URL reference are suspicious but not necessarily malicious.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  The main flaw is obfuscation—function and variable names are nonsensical, which could hide malicious intent. No direct evidence of malicious code like network calls, data exfiltration, or code execution is present.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Analysis of the Reports**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Suspicion:** Obfuscation, dynamic URL, static files potentially compromised.\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 (low).  \n  The report suggests suspicion but finds no explicit malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** 0.4 (moderate).  \n  Reasonable, given obfuscation and dynamic URL handling.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Suspicion:** Obfuscation, but static files are local, no malicious code.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (none).  \n  Correct; no malware detected.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low).  \n  Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Suspicion:** Obfuscated functions, static assets, no external network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Suspicion:** Obfuscated functions, standard static assets, no malicious behavior.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2.  \n  Appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Suspicion:** Obfuscated functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1.  \n  Slightly lower, which is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **3. Consistency & Recommendations**\n\n- The malware scores are consistent with the analysis—no explicit malicious code is evident.\n- The obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive.\n- Static files are loaded locally, reducing risk.\n- The dynamic URL from `urls.duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl` could be a concern if the `urls` module is malicious, but there's no evidence of network activity or code execution.\n\n### **4. Final Score Estimation**\n\nGiven the analysis:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (function names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (low, mainly due to obfuscation and dynamic URL handling, but no direct malicious activity)\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe code appears to be a standard Django/Wagtail admin extension with obfuscated naming. While obfuscation can be a red flag, there is no concrete evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The static assets are local, and the URL is returned from a module, which could be benign or malicious depending on context.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \n- Maintain awareness of the obfuscation.  \n- Verify the contents of `instance_selector.urls` to ensure the URL is safe.  \n- No immediate threat detected, but monitor for future updates or anomalies.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value | Justification                                               |\n|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0               | No evidence of malicious activity                          |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.7               | Function and variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2               | Low risk; mainly obfuscation and dynamic URL handling     |\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown or specific security recommendations.",
