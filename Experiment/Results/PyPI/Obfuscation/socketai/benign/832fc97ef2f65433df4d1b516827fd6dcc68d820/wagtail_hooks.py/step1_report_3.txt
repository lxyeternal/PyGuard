  "purpose": "Register admin URLs and inject CSS/JS assets into the Django admin interface for Wagtail CMS.",
  "sources": "import statements; static file paths in static() calls",
  "sinks": "return statements that provide URLs and HTML tags for inclusion in admin pages",
  "flows": "import data -> static file references -> formatted HTML output for admin interface",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like function names; return of URL from external module; inclusion of static assets, which is typical but should be checked for unexpected modifications",
  "analysis": "The code registers a URL endpoint and injects CSS/JS into the admin interface, which is standard for extending Wagtail. Function names are obfuscated but do not directly indicate malicious intent. The static asset paths are typical and retrieved via Django's static method. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The URL returned from 'urls.duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl' could potentially be manipulated if the 'instance_selector' package is compromised, but without external network calls or dynamic execution, this is not inherently malicious. The obfuscated naming might be suspicious but could also be a result of code minification or code obfuscation for other reasons.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard registration and asset injection for a Django/Wagtail admin extension. No clear malicious behavior detected. Obfuscated function names are suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. Overall security risk appears low.",
