  "purpose": "Register admin URL and insert global CSS/JS assets in Wagtail admin interface",
  "sources": "import statements, return statements for URL, static asset paths",
  "sinks": "returning URL from 'urls.duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl', embedding static files into HTML",
  "flows": "Imported URLs and static files are returned as functions to be used by Wagtail hooks; static files are embedded into HTML output",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated and non-descriptive; URLs variable is imported from 'instance_selector' without context; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; use of format_html with static files is typical for asset inclusion",
  "analysis": "The code registers Wagtail admin hooks to include custom URLs and static assets. The URLs function is obfuscated, which could be benign or suspicious depending on context, but there is no direct evidence of malicious intent. Static assets are loaded securely via Django's static framework. No suspicious data flows, no hidden code, and no insecure patterns are present. The obfuscated function and variable names are unusual but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code appears consistent with typical Wagtail customization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed to add custom URLs and static assets to the Wagtail admin interface. Despite the obfuscated naming, there is no evident malicious behavior or security risk. The structure and behavior are consistent with standard plugin or theme customization.",
