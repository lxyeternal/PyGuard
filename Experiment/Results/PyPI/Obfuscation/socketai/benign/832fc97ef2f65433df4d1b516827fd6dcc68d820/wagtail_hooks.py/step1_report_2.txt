  "purpose": "This code integrates custom URLs and CSS/JS resources into the Django Wagtail admin interface for a package called instance_selector.",
  "sources": "Reading static file paths via static() function, accessing URL list via urls.duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl",
  "sinks": "Embedding static resources into HTML output via format_html, potentially injecting external or local resources",
  "flows": "The code reads static resource paths and injects them into HTML templates, with no external or untrusted user input involved",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function names and variable names, which might be an attempt to conceal purpose, but no malicious code or hardcoded credentials detected",
  "analysis": "The code registers a custom URL function and CSS/JS injections for the admin interface. Function names are obfuscated, but they return static resource links and URLs from a module. No untrusted input sources are present. Static files are loaded locally, not from external domains. No suspicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation appears to be solely for concealment rather than malicious intent. No sensitive data handling, injection points, or insecure practices are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve a standard purpose of adding custom resources to the admin interface with obfuscated function names, which might be suspicious but are not inherently malicious. There is no evidence of malware, data leaks, or malicious behavior. It is considered low risk.",
