  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their findings with the code and assessing the validity of their conclusions and scores.\n\n---\n\n**Overall code review:**\n\n- The code registers admin URLs and injects static CSS/JS into the Django/Wagtail admin interface.\n- Function names are nonsensical and obfuscated, which is suspicious but not necessarily malicious.\n- Static files are loaded via Django's static() function, pointing to local resources.\n- The URL returned from `urls.duMZqEbJSomPEmmhSwSyuyQsYlSwAMLl` is dynamically obtained, which could be benign or malicious depending on its source.\n- No direct user input, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident.\n- The obfuscation may be for concealment or just code minification.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Findings:** Suspicious obfuscation, dynamic URL, static resource embedding.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.4 (moderate suspicion)\n- **Malware Score:** 0.2 (low, no explicit malicious activity)\n- **Analysis:** The report correctly identifies obfuscation and dynamic URL handling as suspicious but finds no direct malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** The risk score seems reasonable given the obfuscation and dynamic URL, but since no malicious activity is evident, a score slightly below 0.5 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Findings:** Obfuscation, static resources, no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (none)\n- **Analysis:** The report emphasizes the benign nature, with no suspicious behavior, which aligns with the code.\n- **Verdict:** The low risk and malware scores are appropriate. The obfuscation alone doesn't warrant higher scores without evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Findings:** Standard resource registration, obfuscated names, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low)\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The code appears typical for Wagtail customizations, with obfuscation being the only suspicious element.\n- **Verdict:** The scores are reasonable; obfuscation alone isn't enough to raise risk significantly.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Findings:** Similar to above, standard registration, obfuscated functions, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Consistent with other reports, no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate scoring.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated functions, static resource injection, no malicious activity.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low)\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** The code seems benign, and obfuscation might be for concealment but not malicious.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and Recommendations:**\n\n- The **malware scores** across all reports are appropriately low; no evidence of malicious activity is present.\n- The **obfuscated** scores are consistently high (~0.4-0.7), which is justified given the nonsensical function names.\n- The **security risk** scores are moderate to low, reflecting suspicion due to obfuscation but no concrete malicious activity.\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n- The static files are standard, local resources, unlikely to be malicious unless the static files themselves are compromised—this cannot be determined from the code alone.\n- The dynamic URL from the `urls` module warrants caution; if the module is compromised, it could redirect or serve malicious content, but there's no direct evidence here.\n- Obfuscation alone isn't malicious, but it warrants scrutiny, especially if the code is from an untrusted source.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.1** — no direct malicious activity detected, but obfuscation and dynamic URL handling are suspicious.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.6** — consistent with the reports, high due to function naming.\n- **Risk score:** **0.3** — moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic URL, but no concrete malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Continuous monitoring of the `instance_selector` package, especially the contents of the `urls` module and static files, is recommended to ensure no malicious modifications occur.",
