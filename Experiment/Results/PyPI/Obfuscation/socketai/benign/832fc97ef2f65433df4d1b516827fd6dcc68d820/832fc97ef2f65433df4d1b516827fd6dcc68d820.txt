The main risks are due to obfuscation and potential XSS via mark_safe, which should be reviewed in context. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation high (~0.8), and overall security risk low (~0.2-0.3). Proper sanitization and review of the context where mark_safe is used are recommended to mitigate potential XSS vulnerabilities."

While obfuscation can be suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The static assets are local, and the dynamic URL source could be benign or malicious depending on its origin. Further verification of the 'urls' module and static files is recommended to confirm safety."

The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the risk score reflects typical web application concerns related to user input handling. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."

There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not elevate the risk score. The overall assessment aligns with the previous reports, confirming a low security threat."
