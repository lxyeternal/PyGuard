  "purpose": "Definition of a custom exception class named XUQZKieGfzsyueFVivueVYYboEhElwfG",
  "sources": "No input sources; class definition does not read external data",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows; class is only a placeholder for an exception",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name, very obscure and non-descriptive, which could be used to hide malicious intent or obfuscation, but on its own it is not malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception with an obscure, nonsensical name. There are no additional methods, data handling, input/output, or behavior. The class appears to be a placeholder or obfuscated. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activity within this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition with an unusually obfuscated name, which alone does not indicate malicious intent. It is likely a placeholder or part of obfuscated code but does not contain malware or security risks in its current form.",
