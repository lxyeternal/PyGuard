  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named XUQZKieGfzsyueFVivueVYYboEhElwfG",
  "sources": "No input or data sources present in the code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data pathways",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious, but no active malicious behavior is evident",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition inheriting from Exception, serving as a custom exception. The class name is a long, seemingly random string, which might be considered obfuscated. However, it does not perform any actions, contain any logic, or interact with external systems. There are no imports, no code execution, or data handling present. The obfuscated class name alone does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution if used in a suspicious context.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines a custom exception class with a nonsensical name but contains no behavior or malicious logic. It does not exhibit malware characteristics or security risks in isolation.",
