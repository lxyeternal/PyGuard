  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named XUQZKieGfzsyueFVivueVYYboEhElwfG",
  "sources": "The class definition itself; no external data sources are read",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; class is only defining an exception",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a simple exception subclass with no methods or data processing",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception with an unusual, non-descriptive name. There are no methods, data, or behaviors that suggest malicious activity. The class is syntactically valid and does not perform any operations or access any resources. The obfuscated name could be suspicious, but on its own, it is not evidence of malicious intent. No other code is present to evaluate for malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, which by itself does not indicate malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks within this snippet.",
