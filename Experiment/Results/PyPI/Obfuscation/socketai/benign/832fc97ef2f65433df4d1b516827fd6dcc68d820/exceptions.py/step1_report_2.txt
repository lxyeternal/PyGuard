  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named XUQZKieGfzsyueFVivueVYYboEhElwfG",
  "sources": "Class definition does not read any external input or data",
  "sinks": "Class definition does not contain any sinks or points where untrusted data could cause harm",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the class is simply a placeholder for exception handling",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but this is not inherently malicious; no suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets are present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name. There are no methods, data flows, or external interactions. It is purely a custom exception class. No signs of malware or security risks are evident. The obfuscated name could be suspicious, but it alone does not indicate malicious intent without further context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception, with no malicious behavior or security issues. The obfuscated class name may suggest code obfuscation but does not constitute malicious activity on its own.",
