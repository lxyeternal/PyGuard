{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, likely used as a placeholder or for concealment.",
  "sources": "Class definition; no data input, external interactions, or data flow present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; class contains only a pass statement.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow beyond class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name, no methods or logic, minimal structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with an obfuscated name. It contains no data, no external data sources, no sinks, and no logic. The obfuscation of the class name suggests concealment or placeholder use but does not imply malicious intent. The absence of data flow, suspicious patterns, or malicious code indicates a benign purpose. The high obfuscation score reflects the nonsensical name, but the malware score remains zero due to lack of malicious behavior. The security risk score is low, acknowledging obfuscation but no active threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated exception class with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation alone does not constitute malicious intent, and the overall assessment confirms the code's harmless nature.",
