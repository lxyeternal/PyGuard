  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named XUQZKieGfzsyueFVivueVYYboEhElwfG",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this code",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points in this code",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths since the code only defines a class",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a random or obfuscated string; no functional code or logic present",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of a single class definition inheriting from Exception, with a nonsensical class name. There are no data sources, data processing, or external interactions. The class is an empty custom exception, which is common and not suspicious. The random-looking class name might suggest obfuscation but is not inherently malicious. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines a custom exception with an obfuscated name, but it contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a simple, benign class definition, possibly obfuscated for concealment but without any harmful intent.",
