  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom Wagtail/Django form and block classes with dynamic model resolution and lazy evaluation.\n- **Sources:** Reads model config, uses `resolve_model_string`, imports external modules.\n- **Sinks:** Calls methods on models, uses lazy evaluation, dynamic attribute handling.\n- **Flow:** From model string resolution to method invocation.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated class/variable names, use of `lazy`, dynamic model resolution.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior detected. Dynamic features are standard but could be risky if untrusted input influences model strings. The method call on models (`GvhQzlxZeuLQsBHGHadiUAlutSIXkKOW.KzZKJaBMMgZOzvIgvNSjlmFuDJApgcqG()`) is standard in Django ORM. No evidence of backdoors or malicious code.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate Wagtail extension with standard dynamic features. No malware, low security risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (low, due to dynamic model resolution).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar, defining custom Wagtail/ Django form and block classes with model resolution.\n- **Sources:** Model strings, external widget classes, registry methods, callables.\n- **Sinks:** Dynamic model resolution, widget instantiation, icon callables.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated class/variable names, use of `lazy()`.\n- **Analysis:** Heavy obfuscation raises suspicion, but no concrete malicious activity. Dynamic model resolution could be exploited if inputs are untrusted, but no evidence here.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated but appears legitimate. Potential risk if external inputs are malicious, but not evident.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0.2 (due to obfuscation and dynamic resolution), Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.3.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Custom Wagtail ChooserBlock with dynamic model resolution and adapter registration.\n- **Sources:** Model strings, registry, lazy evaluation.\n- **Sinks:** Model resolution, lazy attributes, registration.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of `resolve_model_string`, lazy, dynamic registration.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected. Dynamic resolution could be risky if model strings are untrusted, but within scope appears legitimate.\n- **Conclusion:** Secure, standard pattern, low malware risk.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Custom Wagtail blocks with external models and widgets.\n- **Sources:** Model resolution, external modules, lazy attributes.\n- **Sinks:** External method calls, icon callables.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated class/variable names, dynamic icon execution.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation is high, which raises suspicion. External method calls could be exploited if external modules are compromised, but no direct evidence.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated but no clear malicious behavior. Potential for misuse if external dependencies are malicious.\n\n**Score Justification:** Obfuscated = 0.8, Malware = 0.2 (due to obfuscation), Risk = 0.3.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Custom Wagtail components with dynamic model resolution.\n- **Sources:** Model strings, external modules.\n- **Sinks:** External registry calls, icon callables.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscation, dynamic execution.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected. External callables could be risky if externally controlled, but no evidence here.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, standard pattern, no malware.\n\n**Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.3, Risk = 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports are at or below 0.2, with no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated score:** High in reports 2 and 4 (0.8), moderate in 5 (0.3), low in 1 and 3.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0.2 in some reports due to dynamic resolution and obfuscation, but nothing indicates active exploitation.\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The code appears to be part of a legitimate Wagtail CMS extension with dynamic model handling.\n- Obfuscation and dynamic features are typical in CMS plugins but warrant cautious review.\n- No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0.1** (very low, no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.6** (moderate to high, especially in reports 2 and 4)\n- **Risk:** **0.3** (moderate, mainly due to dynamic resolution and obfuscation, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted)\n\n**Summary:** The code is likely legitimate but obfuscated to hinder analysis. No active malware or malicious behavior is evident, but the obfuscation and dynamic features should be monitored, especially if external inputs influence model strings or registry data.",
