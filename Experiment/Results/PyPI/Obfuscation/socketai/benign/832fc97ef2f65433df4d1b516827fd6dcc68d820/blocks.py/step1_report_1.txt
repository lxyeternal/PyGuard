{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom Wagtail/ Django form and block classes, including a chooser block with dynamic model resolution and a custom field block adapter, primarily for form rendering and model selection.",
  "sources": "Reads model configuration from parameters, uses resolve_model_string to dynamically resolve models, and imports from external libraries and modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially problematic code in 'zKzImvbKtAulTuUwyUoFdsmPjDXsjNIe' where a model's method is called, and in 'sRuxnVvqmYxSziwAjyYvuGREhuENlZND' where 'icon' may be called if callable.",
  "flows": "Source: model string resolution and external function calls -> sink: method invocation and dynamic attribute handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy evaluation for placeholder text, dynamic model resolution, and callable icon handling. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. The model resolution via 'resolve_model_string' could be manipulated if model string is untrusted, but context suggests intended use.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily focuses on defining custom Wagtail blocks and adapters, utilizing dynamic model resolution and lazy loading. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system damage. The dynamic resolution of models and lazy evaluation are standard practices but could be misused if untrusted input influences 'target_model'. The 'zKzImvbKtAulTuUwyUoFdsmPjDXsjNIe' function calls a method on a model object, which could be a concern if the method is maliciously overridden or manipulated, but within standard Django behavior, this is safe. The icon callable handling is typical for dynamic icons, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious external calls are present. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate form and block customization purposes, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of custom Wagtail blocks and adapters with dynamic model resolution and lazy loading. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware based on analysis. The use of dynamic features should be noted but appears to be within normal use cases. No immediate security threats are evident, though the dynamic model resolution could be risky if input is untrusted.",
