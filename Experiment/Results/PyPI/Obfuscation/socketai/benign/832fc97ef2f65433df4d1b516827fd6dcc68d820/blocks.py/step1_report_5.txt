  "purpose": "Custom Wagtail chooser and block adapter classes for dynamic model resolution and widget configuration.",
  "sources": "Input data from Wagtail CMS framework methods, model string resolution, and external widget/registry imports.",
  "sinks": "Model string resolution, widget instantiation, external registry method calls, and dynamic icon callables.",
  "flows": "Model string or widget input → resolution or widget instantiation → potential dynamic icon execution or external registry calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of lazy evaluation for model placeholder; dynamic execution of icon functions; indirect external registry calls; no hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom Wagtail form components with dynamic model resolution and widget configuration, utilizing lazy evaluation and cached properties. It calls external registry and widget functions, and potentially executes callables for icons, which could be malicious if external sources are compromised. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity is directly visible. The dynamic icon callable execution is a minor risk if externally controlled, but there's no evidence of malicious intent based on this code alone. The code's obfuscation is limited to meaningless class and variable names, but no encrypted or deliberately obscure logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard custom widget and block adapter setup with some dynamic resolution features. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks within this isolated module. External dependencies and their integrity are beyond this review scope. Overall, the risk is low, but caution should be taken if external callables are externally controlled.",
