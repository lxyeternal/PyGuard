  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom Wagtail/Django form and block classes, including dynamic model resolution.\n- **Sources:** Reads model config, uses `resolve_model_string`, imports external modules.\n- **Sinks:** Calls methods on models, uses lazy evaluation.\n- **Flow:** From model string resolution to method invocation.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of lazy, dynamic model resolution, obfuscated names.\n- **Analysis:** No evidence of malicious activity; standard pattern for dynamic model handling. The main concern is untrusted input influencing `resolve_model_string`, but in typical Wagtail use, this is controlled.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate code, low security risk, no malware.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2 (low), obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, custom Wagtail/Django form and block classes, with dynamic model resolution.\n- **Sources:** Reads model strings, imports obscure modules, registry calls.\n- **Sinks:** Dynamic model resolution, widget instantiation, potential callables (`icon()`).\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated class/variable names, dynamic behavior, use of `lazy`.\n- **Analysis:** Heavy obfuscation raises suspicion but no direct malicious activity. Dynamic resolution could be exploited if model strings are untrusted, but within context, seems legitimate.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated but appears legitimate, moderate concern due to obfuscation, malware score 0.2.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware 0.2, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.3 seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom Wagtail chooser block with dynamic model resolution.\n- **Sources:** Model strings, external modules, registry.\n- **Sinks:** Model resolution, widget creation, external calls.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of lazy, dynamic model resolution.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected; standard Wagtail pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, legitimate extension, malware 0.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2 is reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Custom Wagtail blocks with external models and widgets.\n- **Sources:** Model strings, external modules.\n- **Sinks:** External registry calls, dynamic icon execution.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscation, dynamic icon callables.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation raises suspicion, but no evidence of malicious behavior. External dependencies could be compromised, but not evident here.\n- **Conclusion:** Suspicious obfuscation but no clear malicious activity.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware 0.1, obfuscated 0.8, risk 0.2 is consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** Custom Wagtail widget setup with dynamic model resolution.\n- **Sources:** Model strings, external modules.\n- **Sinks:** Model resolution, icon callables.\n- **Anomalies:** Lazy evaluation, dynamic icon functions.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity; standard pattern.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, legitimate.\n\n**Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0.3, risk 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All are very low, indicating no malicious code detected.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Higher in some reports, especially 2 and 4, due to naming and module obscurity.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly elevated where obfuscation and dynamic resolution are present, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n\n### **My independent estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors).\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (significant obfuscation, obscure variable/class names).\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (dynamic model resolution and external dependencies pose some risk if inputs are untrusted, but overall, the code appears to serve legitimate purposes).\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe code appears to be a set of custom Wagtail CMS extensions, heavily obfuscated in some parts, but lacking concrete evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the obfuscation and dynamic resolution which could be exploited if external inputs are untrusted. However, within the scope of this analysis, it does not constitute a supply chain security threat.\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Review external inputs influencing `resolve_model_string`.\n- Verify the integrity of external modules and registry functions.\n- Consider de-obfuscating variable names for clearer security assessment.\n\n**Overall, I assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7\n- **Risk score:** 0.3",
