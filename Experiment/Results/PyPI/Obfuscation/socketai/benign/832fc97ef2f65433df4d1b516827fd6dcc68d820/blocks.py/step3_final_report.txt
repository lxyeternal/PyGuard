  "purpose": "Defines custom Wagtail/ Django form and block classes with dynamic model resolution and lazy evaluation.",
  "sources": "Model string resolution via resolve_model_string, external registry and widget calls, lazy evaluation.",
  "sinks": "Calls to model methods, dynamic attribute access, external registry functions, icon callables.",
  "flows": "From model string resolution to method invocation, to external registry calls, and dynamic icon execution.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and variable names, use of lazy evaluation, dynamic model resolution, callable icons.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard Wagtail patterns such as dynamic model resolution and lazy evaluation. No evidence of malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Obfuscation and dynamic features could potentially conceal malicious intent, but no concrete indicators are present. The external registry and widget calls are typical but should be validated if inputs are untrusted. The model resolution is a common pattern but warrants caution if model strings are influenced by untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve legitimate purposes within a CMS extension, with obfuscation and dynamic features that warrant cautious review but no direct malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, and no malware is detected.",
