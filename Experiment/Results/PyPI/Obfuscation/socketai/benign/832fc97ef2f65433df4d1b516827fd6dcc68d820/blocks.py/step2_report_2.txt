  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom Wagtail/ Django form and block classes with dynamic model resolution.\n- **Key points:** Uses `resolve_model_string`, lazy evaluation, and external registry functions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Standard dynamic model resolution, no suspicious external calls or backdoors. The only concern is potential misuse if the model string input is untrusted, but within this context, it appears intended.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, low security risk (0.2), malware score 0, confidence 0.8.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to above, heavily obfuscated, involving dynamic model resolution and widget registration.\n- **Key points:** Obfuscation, dynamic execution (`icon()`), external registry and widget calls.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Obfuscation and dynamic callables could hide malicious intent, but no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The external registry could be compromised, but no direct malicious behavior is evident.\n- **Conclusion:** Slightly higher obfuscation, malware score 0.2, security risk 0.3, confidence 0.7.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Custom Wagtail block with dynamic model resolution.\n- **Key points:** Uses `resolve_model_string`, lazy evaluation, no suspicious external calls.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Typical pattern for Wagtail customizations, potential risk if model strings are untrusted, but no malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, malware 0, confidence 0.8.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Custom Wagtail chooser and adapter classes, with obfuscation.\n- **Key points:** Obfuscated names, external module interactions, dynamic icon callables.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Obfuscation and external dependencies could be exploited, but no direct malicious activity detected.\n- **Conclusion:** Slightly higher obfuscation, malware 0.1, risk 0.2, confidence 0.8.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar custom Wagtail components with dynamic resolution.\n- **Key points:** Lazy evaluation, external registry, no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Flow & Anomalies:** Dynamic icon execution and external calls, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Low risk, malware 0, confidence 0.8.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or network activity. The highest malware score across reports is 0.2, which is low.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Some reports report obfuscation levels up to 0.8, but this appears to be intentional naming, not encryption or code hiding.\n- **Risk score:** Given the dynamic model resolution and external dependencies, the main concern is potential misuse if inputs are untrusted, but no concrete malicious activity is observed.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0.1** — No malicious activity detected; the obfuscation is not malicious per se.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0.5** — Moderate obfuscation due to naming conventions; not necessarily malicious but warrants caution.\n- **Risk score:** **0.3** — Slightly elevated due to dynamic resolution and external dependencies, but overall low.\n\n### Summary:\nThe code appears to serve legitimate purposes within a Wagtail CMS extension, with some obfuscation and dynamic features that could be misused if inputs are untrusted. However, based on the provided snippets and analysis, there is no evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.5\n- **Risk:** 0.3\n\nThese reflect a cautious but overall benign assessment.",
