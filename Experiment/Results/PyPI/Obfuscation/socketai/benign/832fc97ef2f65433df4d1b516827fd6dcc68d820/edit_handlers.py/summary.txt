  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated application code with no current evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The main risks are due to obfuscation and potential XSS via mark_safe, which should be reviewed in context. The malware score should remain at 0, obfuscation high (~0.8), and overall security risk low (~0.2-0.3). Proper sanitization and review of the context where mark_safe is used are recommended to mitigate potential XSS vulnerabilities."
