  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate backend logic for managing instances and embedded content, with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the risk score reflects typical web application concerns related to user input handling. Overall, the code is safe and well-structured."
