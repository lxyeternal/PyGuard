  "conclusion": "The code is primarily legitimate model code with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data theft, network communication, or sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. External dependency integrity should be verified, but the code itself is low risk."
