{
  "purpose": "The code defines transformer-based neural network modules and routines for loading pretrained weights, primarily used in vision models.",
  "sources": "Reads from external weight checkpoint files during model loading.",
  "sinks": "No external network communication or data exfiltration observed; data flows internally through tensor operations.",
  "flows": "Loads weights from files, processes tensors through model layers, and outputs transformed tensors.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names; reliance on external checkpoint files which could be tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard model definitions with complex naming and external weight loading. No signs of malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present. Obfuscation is high but appears to serve to conceal complexity rather than malicious intent. External files are a supply chain risk but are common in model deployment. The code structure and logic are consistent with legitimate deep learning workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily legitimate model code with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data theft, network communication, or sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. External dependency integrity should be verified, but the code itself is low risk.",
