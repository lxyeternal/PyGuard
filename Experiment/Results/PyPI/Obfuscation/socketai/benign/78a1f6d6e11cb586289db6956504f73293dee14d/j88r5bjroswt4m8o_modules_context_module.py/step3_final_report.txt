  "purpose": "Defines neural network modules with convolutional and attention mechanisms, likely for image or feature processing.",
  "sources": "Input tensor passed into the model's forward method; internal layer operations.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through convolutional layers, attention modules, concatenation, and residual addition within the model's forward pass.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names; no external communication or suspicious code behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard deep learning modules with convolutional and attention components. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. Obfuscation appears to be for proprietary concealment rather than malicious intent. The structure and functions are typical for neural network architectures, and no suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, system manipulation, or external data handling are evident. The obfuscation scores are moderate, reflecting naming concealment, but do not imply malicious behavior. Malware and security risk scores are zero and low respectively, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated neural network implementation with no signs of malware or malicious intent. Obfuscation likely serves proprietary purposes. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
