  "purpose": "Open-source background removal/image segmentation using deep learning models, supporting images, videos, and webcam input.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, local files, URLs, webcam streams, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Saved image/video files, display windows, network streams, base64 UI elements.",
  "flows": "Model download from external URLs or local files -> model loading -> image/video input processing -> output generation or display.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic import and eval usage, external URL downloads for models, base64 encoding for UI, environment variable reliance.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a background removal pipeline, dynamically loads models from external sources with hash validation, and employs obfuscation and dynamic code execution techniques. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation and dynamic URL fetching pose supply chain and concealment risks but do not confirm malicious intent. Use of eval() and external URLs should be carefully managed and verified in deployment environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate background removal tool with obfuscation and dynamic behaviors that warrant cautious deployment. No definitive signs of malware or sabotage are detected. The supply chain risk from external model URLs should be mitigated through source verification. Overall, the security risk is low, with a malware score around 0.1, obfuscation at approximately 0.7, and moderate risk (~0.3).",
