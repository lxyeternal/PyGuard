  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate background removal tool with obfuscation and dynamic behaviors that warrant cautious deployment. No definitive signs of malware or sabotage are detected. The supply chain risk from external model URLs should be mitigated through source verification. Overall, the security risk is low, with a malware score around 0.1, obfuscation at approximately 0.7, and moderate risk (~0.3)."
