  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, cache-enabled API client for GPT-4 and Claude with no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscated naming warrants moderate suspicion but does not imply sabotage. Malware score is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation suspicion is moderate (~0.4). The overall security posture is low risk."
