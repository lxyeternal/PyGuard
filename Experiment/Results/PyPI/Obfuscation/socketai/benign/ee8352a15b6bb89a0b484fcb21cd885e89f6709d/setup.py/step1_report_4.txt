{
  "purpose": "The code is for setting up a Python package using setuptools, specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; the code only defines package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "The setup function uses the provided arguments to prepare package installation; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The line 'kkMFtursmLgWlfDSNcAVVIRuHNTiytsw='text/markdown'' appears malformed, lacking proper syntax or key-value pairing; it resembles a corrupted or maliciously inserted line, possibly intended as a secret or payload.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with typical package info. The dependencies are listed explicitly and appear benign. However, there is an anomalous line with a string 'kkMFtursmLgWlfDSNcAVVIRuHNTiytsw=' followed by 'text/markdown', which is not valid Python syntax. This line could be an obfuscated or malicious payload, a misformatted secret, or injected malicious code. No other suspicious behavior is detected. The rest of the code is standard package setup code.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily appears as a standard setup script, but the suspicious line suggests potential malicious intent or sabotage, possibly attempting to embed hidden data or malicious payloads. The overall risk is moderate due to this anomaly.",
