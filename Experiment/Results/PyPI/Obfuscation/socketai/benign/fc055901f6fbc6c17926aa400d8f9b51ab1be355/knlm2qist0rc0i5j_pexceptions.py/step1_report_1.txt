  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named 'haiDpiHlfjFYQMdiWwvSwskjUBsvvymf'.",
  "sources": "Class definition does not read any external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class is only defined.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with a non-descriptive, seemingly random name. There are no functions, data handling, or external interactions. The obfuscated class name could indicate malicious intent, such as hiding malicious behavior or attempting to evade detection. However, the class itself is harmless and does not perform any malicious activity by itself. The code is very minimal and does not contain any suspicious logic or payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple class definition with an obfuscated name. It does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious logic, but the obfuscated name could be used in malicious contexts. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants caution due to naming.",
