  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named 'haiDpiHlfjFYQMdiWwvSwskjUBsvvymf'.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no potential data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines an exception class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a random string, which is unusual and could be indicative of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is minimal and does not perform any operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with a non-descriptive, seemingly random name. There are no data inputs, outputs, or behaviors. The class does not contain any malicious code, but the naming pattern is suspicious and might be used to obfuscate intent or evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior by itself, but the unusual class name raises suspicion about obfuscation. There are no security risks or malicious actions present in this snippet.",
