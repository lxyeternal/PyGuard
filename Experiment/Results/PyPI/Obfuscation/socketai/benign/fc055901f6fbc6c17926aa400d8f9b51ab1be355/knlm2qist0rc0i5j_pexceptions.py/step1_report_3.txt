  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named haiDpiHlfjFYQMdiWwvSwskjUBsvvymf.",
  "sources": "None; no input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling, output, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, as the code only declares a class with no methods or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated string; no meaningful or descriptive purpose is evident. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single exception class with an obfuscated name, which could be a sign of attempting to conceal intent or malicious obfuscation. However, there are no active operations, data handling, or external interactions. The class is a straightforward subclass of Exception, with no additional methods or attributes. The obfuscated name alone does not indicate malicious behavior but warrants caution due to lack of transparency.",
  "conclusion": "This code merely defines a custom exception with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscated class name is suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
