  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named haiDpiHlfjFYQMdiWwvSwskjUBsvvymf",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flow since no operations are performed beyond class definition",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name that appears randomly generated or obfuscated, no other suspicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single class definition for a custom exception with an obfuscated name. There are no data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The class is a subclass of Exception and contains only a 'pass' statement, indicating a placeholder or deliberately obscured naming. No suspicious behaviors or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple, non-malicious class definition with an obfuscated name, likely intended to serve as a custom exception. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
