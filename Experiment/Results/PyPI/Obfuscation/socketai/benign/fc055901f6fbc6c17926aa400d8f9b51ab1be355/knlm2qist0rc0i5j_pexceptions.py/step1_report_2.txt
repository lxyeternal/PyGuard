  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named 'haiDpiHlfjFYQMdiWwvSwskjUBsvvymf'.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling occurs in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink pathways present.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a randomly generated string, which may suggest obfuscation or obfuscated naming. The code contains only a class definition inheriting from Exception with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class definition for a custom exception with a seemingly random class name. No input handling, no data processing, no suspicious function calls, or data leaks are present. The class does not contain any executable logic, making it unlikely to be malicious by itself. The unusual class name could be an attempt to obfuscate, but without further context or code, it's not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be a simple, benign class definition, possibly generated or obfuscated, but not malicious.",
