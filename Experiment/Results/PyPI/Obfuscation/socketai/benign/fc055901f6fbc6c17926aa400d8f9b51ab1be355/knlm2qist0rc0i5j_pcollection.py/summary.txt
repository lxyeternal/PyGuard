  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with signs of potential malicious intent, such as suspicious import statements and malformed functions. While no explicit malicious payloads are evident, the obfuscation and structural anomalies justify a high security concern. It should be thoroughly deobfuscated and analyzed before deployment or further use."
