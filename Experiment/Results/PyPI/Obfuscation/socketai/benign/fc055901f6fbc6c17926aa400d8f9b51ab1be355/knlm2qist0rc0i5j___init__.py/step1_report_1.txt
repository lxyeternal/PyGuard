{
  "purpose": "Import modules and components from the petdb package, defining the package version and exportable symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing specific classes and functions from petdb modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; merely module imports and variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions (e.g., nonsensical variable names), but no malicious or suspicious code behaviors such as dynamic code execution or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from a package named petdb, assigns a version string, and declares __all__ for exports. Variable names appear obfuscated but do not execute or manipulate data. There are no network calls, file operations, or dynamic code execution observed. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical module initialization script with obfuscated variable names; it does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content.",
