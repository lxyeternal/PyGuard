  "purpose": "Module initialization with import statements, version info, and export declarations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'petdb' modules, version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "Imports and metadata setup; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and variable names, but no malicious code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, a version string, and an __all__ list. Variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation, but no dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling from untrusted sources is observed. The structure suggests a benign module setup or stub. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, though it warrants cautious review if more code is available.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module import and export setup with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware or security risks is detected. Obfuscation may be benign or part of code protection, but further review of actual module contents is recommended if available.",
