  "purpose": "Import and export definitions for the petdb service modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from petdb.service.pdb, petdb.service.pcollection, petdb.service.api modules.",
  "sinks": "None; static import statements do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "None; no runtime data flow or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, non-descriptive identifiers which could indicate obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names and an __all__ list. No data flows, network activity, or executable logic are present. The obfuscated identifiers raise suspicion but do not directly indicate malicious behavior. The lack of active code or data handling suggests benign intent, though obfuscation warrants cautious review. Malware scoring is appropriately low, and obfuscation scoring is high due to naming patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks is evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware risk remains minimal. Further review of the entire package is recommended before deployment.",
