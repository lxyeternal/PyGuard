  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and external API calls, which are suspicious and warrant further review. However, no explicit malicious activity is confirmed. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a moderate malware suspicion (around 0.3-0.4), high obfuscation (around 0.8), and moderate risk (around 0.4). Further analysis of the imported modules and the external API functions is necessary to determine malicious intent. Until then, treat this code with caution, especially regarding the external API functions and obfuscated components."
