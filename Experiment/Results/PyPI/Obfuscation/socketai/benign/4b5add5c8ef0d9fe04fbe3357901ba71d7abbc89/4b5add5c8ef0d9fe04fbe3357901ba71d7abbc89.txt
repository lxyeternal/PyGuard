      "conclusion": "The script is likely a legitimate workflow client with no active malicious behavior detected. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants further review of the imported utility functions. No signs of malware or sabotage are evident, but the obfuscation and external URL handling should be monitored. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is very low."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code does not contain explicit malware or malicious payloads but exhibits moderate security concerns due to remote file handling, lack of validation, and obfuscation. These features could be exploited maliciously in a compromised environment. The overall malware score is estimated at 0.4, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk at 0.6, indicating moderate to high concern that warrants thorough review before deployment."
