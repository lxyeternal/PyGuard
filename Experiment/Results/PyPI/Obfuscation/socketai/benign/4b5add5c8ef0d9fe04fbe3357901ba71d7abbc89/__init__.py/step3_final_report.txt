  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, stdin, or external data sources; code execution points such as eval/exec; hardcoded secrets; network communication functions.",
  "sinks": "Data output, network transmission, environment variable access, file modifications, or system commands that could lead to data exfiltration or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input through code execution or network functions to sinks such as data transmission or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code execution (`exec`/`eval`), hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, suspicious network connections, or unusual code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution (`exec`/`eval`) and hardcoded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent. Obfuscation is present, which complicates analysis but is justified by the suspicious traits. The code's purpose appears to involve data exfiltration or remote control. No benign patterns or standard library usage justify a low malware score. The security risk is high due to the potential for data theft and system compromise. Confidence in these findings is high, given the suspicious features identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high malicious potential, with obfuscation and dynamic execution indicating malicious intent. The scores reflect significant security concerns, and the code should be treated as malicious.",

  "obfuscated": 0.7,
