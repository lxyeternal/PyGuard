  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python module or script, possibly for data processing or utility functions, with no immediately apparent malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Code reads input from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly standard input or files (if present). No explicit external data sources are identified in the provided code fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, but none are explicitly present or suspicious in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (parameters, environment variables) through functions or processing steps without any indication of untrusted data leading to dangerous sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. The code structure appears straightforward. No backdoors or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code does not show signs of malware such as network exfiltration, reverse shells, or data theft. It primarily involves standard data processing, and all used libraries are common. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic. The security aspects seem standard; no insecure practices or vulnerabilities are evident based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activity or anomalies detected.",
