  "conclusion": "The code does not contain explicit malware or malicious payloads but exhibits moderate security concerns due to remote file handling, lack of validation, and obfuscation. These features could be exploited maliciously in a compromised environment. The overall malware score is estimated at 0.4, obfuscation at 0.7, and security risk at 0.6, indicating moderate to high concern that warrants thorough review before deployment."
