  "purpose": "Command-line client for Workflow Execution Service (WES), facilitating workflow management, log retrieval, and status monitoring.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (WES_API_HOST, WES_API_AUTH, WES_API_PROTO), command-line arguments, external URLs for logs and outputs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP requests to fetch logs and outputs, JSON serialization of responses, logging outputs to console, stdout for IDs.",
  "flows": "Inputs from env vars and args are used to construct API requests; responses are processed and outputted; logs fetched via URLs are retrieved and displayed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated functions imported from 'wes_client.util', inconsistent variable naming, dynamic URL handling, reliance on external URLs for logs.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a workflow client, performing API calls, polling for status, and retrieving logs. Obfuscated functions and non-descriptive variable names hinder transparency but do not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No evidence of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or sabotage is present. The obfuscation could be for legitimate reasons or conceal malicious code; external URL handling could be exploited if inputs are malicious. Overall, the script appears to be a standard client with potential concerns mainly around obfuscation and external dependencies.",
  "conclusion": "The script is likely a legitimate workflow client with no active malicious behavior detected. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants further review of the imported utility functions. No signs of malware or sabotage are evident, but the obfuscation and external URL handling should be monitored. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is very low.",
