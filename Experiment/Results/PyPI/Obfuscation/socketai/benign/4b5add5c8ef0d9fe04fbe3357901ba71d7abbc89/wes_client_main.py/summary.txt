  "conclusion": "The script is likely a legitimate workflow client with no active malicious behavior detected. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants further review of the imported utility functions. No signs of malware or sabotage are evident, but the obfuscation and external URL handling should be monitored. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is very low."
