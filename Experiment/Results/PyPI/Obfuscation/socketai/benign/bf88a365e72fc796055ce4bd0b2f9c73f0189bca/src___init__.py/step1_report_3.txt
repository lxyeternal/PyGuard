  "sinks": "No direct sink or data leak points are evident in this line",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code or data from a local module; no data flow to external sources or sinks",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'eqVZGIHYwQaSSHvmsObMmaDbAIkMIjNl' appears to be a nonsensical or obfuscated identifier, which is suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of an attribute or submodule with a highly obfuscated or random name, which can be a tactic to hide malicious intent. The import itself is straightforward, but the use of a nonsensical identifier may indicate obfuscation. No other code is present to analyze behaviors or data flows. The lack of additional context limits a full assessment, but the naming suggests possible obfuscation or concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a simple import statement with an obfuscated identifier. On its own, it does not explicitly perform malicious actions, but the obfuscation raises suspicion. Additional code would be necessary to confirm malicious behavior, but based solely on this line, there is a potential risk due to obfuscation.",
