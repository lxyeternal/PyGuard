  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security risks of the Python import statement involving an obfuscated member from a local module.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'eqVZGIHYwQaSSHvmsObMmaDbAIkMIjNl' from '.bbrf'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import source (local module) to the usage of the imported member; no further flow visible.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated member name, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious; no executable code or data flow.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal import statement with an obfuscated identifier, raising suspicion of obfuscation but lacking evidence of malicious activity. The scores across reports reflect high suspicion of obfuscation (0.8-0.9), low malware likelihood (0.0-0.2), and low risk (0.2-0.3). The absence of additional code or context prevents definitive conclusions. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary. Further review of the 'bbrf' module is recommended to determine if the obfuscated member is benign or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement's obfuscated identifier warrants caution but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low, with high suspicion due to obfuscation but no evidence of malware. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence; further investigation of the module contents is advised.",
