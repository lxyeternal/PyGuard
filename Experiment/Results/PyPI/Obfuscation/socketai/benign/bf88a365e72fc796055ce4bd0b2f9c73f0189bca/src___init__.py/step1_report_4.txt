  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this line.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from untrusted sources or to sinks is visible.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object name 'eqVZGIHYwQaSSHvmsObMmaDbAIkMIjNl' appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated identifier, which can be suspicious but may also be a normal part of obfuscation or code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single import statement from a relative module, importing an object with a highly obfuscated name. No other code is present, making it difficult to assess intent. The obfuscated import name could be a sign of attempts to conceal malicious intent or simply code obfuscation. There are no obvious signs of malicious behavior or malicious code execution in this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated identifier warrants caution, but without additional context or code, this appears to be a standard import with possible obfuscation. No malware or security risks are clearly identifiable from this snippet.",
