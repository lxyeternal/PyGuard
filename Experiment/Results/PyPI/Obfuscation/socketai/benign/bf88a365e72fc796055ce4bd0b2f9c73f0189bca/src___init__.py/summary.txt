  "conclusion": "The import statement's obfuscated identifier warrants caution but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low, with high suspicion due to obfuscation but no evidence of malware. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence; further investigation of the module contents is advised."
