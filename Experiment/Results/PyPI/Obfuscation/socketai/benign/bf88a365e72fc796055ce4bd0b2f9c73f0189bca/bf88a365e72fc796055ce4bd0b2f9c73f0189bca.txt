No direct malware or malicious payloads are detected, but the obfuscation and operational scope warrant cautious review. The scores are set as malware: 0.1, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 0.5 for a balanced assessment."

There is no direct evidence of malware or sabotage, but the obfuscation and insecure settings warrant cautious review and further analysis."

Suspicious reports (1, 2, 4) are appropriately scored high for malware and obfuscation, while benign report 3 is correctly scored low. Minor score adjustments could be made, but current values accurately reflect the assessed threat levels."
