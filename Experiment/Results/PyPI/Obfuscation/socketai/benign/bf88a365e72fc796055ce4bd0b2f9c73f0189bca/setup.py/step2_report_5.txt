  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, but no malicious activity detected.\n- **Errors/flaws?** The variable names are unusual but consistent; no functional errors or malicious logic.\n- **Scores?** Malware score = 0, Security risk = 0.1, Obfuscated = 0.8, Confidence = 0.9. These seem reasonable given the obfuscation but no malicious behavior.\n- **Justification for scores:** The high obfuscation score is justified; malware score is zero as no malicious activity is evident. The low security risk aligns with benign setup code.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar to report 1, standard setup with some malformed or suspicious variable names.\n- **Errors/flaws?** The line with `'CwhUTWidMQxYOfnwNBejiQxvZqdmZKXa='` appears malformed or possibly a typo, but it does not execute code or pose security issues.\n- **Scores?** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0.2, Obfuscated = 0.3, Confidence = 0.9. Slightly higher security risk due to malformed line but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Justification:** The malformed line is likely a typo or obfuscation, not malicious. The malware score remains zero.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard setup script, obfuscated variable names, but no malicious activity.\n- **Errors/flaws?** Variable names are unusual; obfuscation might be intentional or accidental.\n- **Scores?** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.6, Confidence = 0.9. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, so malware score remains zero.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Again, standard setup with obfuscated variable names.\n- **Errors/flaws?** Variable names are odd but used only for static strings.\n- **Scores?** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.7, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, obfuscation is superficial.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard setup script, obfuscated variable names.\n- **Errors/flaws?** Variable names are unusual but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores?** Malware = 0, Security risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.2, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Justification:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation minor.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for code aesthetics or minimal obfuscation, but no malicious logic is detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.8, mostly around 0.6. The variable names are nonsensical, which justifies a moderate obfuscation score.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the absence of malicious activity, network calls, or code execution, the overall security risk remains very low (near 0).\n\n### Final Estimations:\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.6** (variable names are deliberately obscure but not malicious)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal security risk, mainly due to obfuscation)\n\n**Summary:** The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact security. No changes to scores are necessary beyond confirming these assessments.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always recommend further static analysis or runtime checks if the obfuscation seems suspicious, but based on the provided code and reports, the package appears safe.",
