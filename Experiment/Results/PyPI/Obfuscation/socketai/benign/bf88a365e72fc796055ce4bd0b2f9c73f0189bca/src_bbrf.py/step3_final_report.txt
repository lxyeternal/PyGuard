  "purpose": "Management tool for security data, configurations, and agent operations, including URL/IP validation, database updates, and system commands.",
  "sources": "Config files, user input prompts, URL/IP parsing, API/database interactions, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Database documents, logs, network requests, system commands, configuration files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from configs/user input into database updates, API calls, and system operations; URL/IP parsing influences network interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, complex control flow, and functions for destructive operations like data deletion and server upgrade.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, with complex functions managing security data, configurations, and system commands. No explicit malicious payloads such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation and scope for misuse (e.g., data deletion, server upgrade) pose moderate security risks. The low malware score (around 0.1-0.2) aligns with the absence of direct malicious activity. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) is justified by variable naming and control flow complexity. The overall security risk (~0.5) reflects operational capabilities that could be misused but do not currently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate but heavily obfuscated security management CLI with potential for misuse. No direct malware or malicious payloads are detected, but the obfuscation and operational scope warrant cautious review. The scores are set as malware: 0.1, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 0.5 for a balanced assessment.",
