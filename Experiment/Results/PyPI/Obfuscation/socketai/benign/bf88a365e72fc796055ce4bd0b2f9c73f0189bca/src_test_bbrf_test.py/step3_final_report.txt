  "purpose": "CLI commands and test assertions for managing network assets, domains, URLs, services, and tags within a security management tool.",
  "sources": "Input data read from sys.stdin during tests, command-line arguments for managing internal data structures.",
  "sinks": "Function calls like bbrf() processing commands; outputs include assertions and JSON parsing; no evidence of data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into command functions; processed internally; outputs verified via assertions and JSON responses.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads detected; code is primarily test and command definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of command definitions, test assertions, and input simulations for a network security management tool. No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or malicious system calls are present. Data flows involve reading from stdin and command arguments, typical for such tools. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The malware score is correctly set to 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code. Obfuscation score is 0, consistent with the clear code structure. Overall, the code appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of command definitions and test assertions for managing network assets. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
