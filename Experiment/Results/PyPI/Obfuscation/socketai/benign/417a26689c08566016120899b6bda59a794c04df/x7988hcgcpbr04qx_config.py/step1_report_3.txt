  "purpose": "Configure application models and database connections with provided connection string.",
  "sources": "Function parameter bkdbyIlZeOxdTqVTZJGuXEuloNxuEInx used as input for connection string.",
  "sinks": "Return statement constructing a dict with connection details; no external output or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Input parameter is directly used to set 'default' connection in the returned dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a string input and returns a dictionary with configuration details, including a connection string and model references. The code is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leakage mechanisms. Variable naming is obfuscated but consistent, and there are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors or hidden data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration helper function with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated variable names do not suggest malicious behavior, and the code structure is simple and secure.",
