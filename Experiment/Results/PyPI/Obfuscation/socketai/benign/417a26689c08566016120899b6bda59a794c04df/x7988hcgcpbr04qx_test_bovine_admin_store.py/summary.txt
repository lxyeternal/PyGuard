  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code shows suspicious patterns such as obfuscation and external network interactions but lacks concrete evidence of malicious payloads or behaviors. The scores are appropriate, reflecting moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and network activity. Further review of imported modules and full context is recommended before confirming malicious intent."
