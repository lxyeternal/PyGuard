  "purpose": "Define several enumeration classes for different categories or states used in an application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with string assignments within each Enum member.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks such as network or file operations present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines enums.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated class and variable names; no external input or data processing; no clear malicious intent; no code execution, data leakage, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains enum class definitions with string values, with obfuscated class and variable names. There are no input handling, data processing, or system operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code segments are present. The structure is straightforward, and the content appears to be for categorization or configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign set of enumeration definitions with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks are detected.",
