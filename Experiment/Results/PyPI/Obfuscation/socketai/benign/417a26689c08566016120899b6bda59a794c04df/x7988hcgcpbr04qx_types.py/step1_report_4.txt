  "purpose": "Define multiple Enum classes with string constants, likely for configuration or categorization purposes.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions with string assignments",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; enums are static definitions",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical, obfuscated class and variable names; no meaningful documentation or comments; all string values are simple identifiers, no code injection or dynamic code execution observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines several Enum classes with string constants that appear obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical. There is no user input, network access, file operations, or dynamic code execution present. The code serves as static configuration or categorization constructs. The unusual naming could suggest an attempt at obfuscation, but no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions are evident. The structure is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated enum definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. There are no signs of malware, data leaks, or malicious logic. The primary concern is the obfuscated naming, which might hinder understanding but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
