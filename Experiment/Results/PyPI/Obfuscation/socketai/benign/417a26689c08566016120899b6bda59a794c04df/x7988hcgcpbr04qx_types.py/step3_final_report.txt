  "purpose": "Static enum definitions serving as configuration or categorization constants with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions with string constants, no external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A – static definitions only, no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no dynamic code or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum classes with string values, with obfuscated names that could suggest an attempt at concealment. No dynamic behavior, data processing, network activity, or code injection is present. Malware scores are correctly set to 0, indicating no malicious activity. The obfuscation score of 0.8 reflects the nonsensical naming, which is appropriate. The low security risk score of 0.1 aligns with the benign static nature of the code. Confidence in benign assessment is high (~0.8-0.9). No logical errors or suspicious patterns are identified. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, but warrants cautious interpretation. Overall, the code appears as benign configuration with superficial obfuscation, and the scores are consistent with this conclusion.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated enum definitions with no malicious or security threats. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
