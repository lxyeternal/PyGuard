{
  "purpose": "The code defines several Enum classes with string values, likely used for categorizing or managing different states or types within a larger application.",
  "sources": "The source data is the hardcoded enum members and their string values within the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not perform any input/output operations, network requests, or data processing that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the enums are statically defined and do not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "The enum class and member names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be a sign of code obfuscation or attempt to hide malicious intent. However, the content itself is simple enumeration definitions with no dynamic or reflective code, no hidden code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three Enum classes with members assigned fixed string values. There are no functions, input/output operations, or external interactions. The obfuscated names might suggest an attempt at hiding intent, but the actual code is benign. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious logic are present. The absence of dynamic execution, external data processing, or network operations indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward declaration of enums with obfuscated names, likely to mask internal logic or for code obfuscation purposes. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment.",
