      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a package management utility with no active malware detected. However, its use of dynamic command execution without input validation and obfuscated/incomplete code snippets pose security risks, especially command injection vulnerabilities. It warrants cautious review, input sanitization, and code clarification before deployment in security-sensitive contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Docker utility for inspecting and managing containers, with some obfuscation and dynamic command execution. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The primary concern is variable obfuscation and potential command injection if inputs are not sanitized, but current usage appears safe. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a plugin and task loader with high potential for executing malicious or untrusted code. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the combination of obfuscation, dynamic loading, and filesystem interactions warrants a high security concern. The scores assigned in the reports are generally appropriate; I recommend setting the malware score at approximately 0.6, obfuscated at 0.75, and overall security risk at 0.75 to reflect the significant potential for supply chain or code injection vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with signs of obfuscation and suspicious warning filter argument, but no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The current scores are consistent with the static analysis. Further dynamic or full code review is recommended to confirm no hidden malicious behavior."

Obfuscation is likely due to code generation or deliberate obscurity, not malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score should remain at 0."

The suspicion is limited to obfuscation itself, which does not confirm malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and reflect a low threat level, with obfuscation being the primary concern. No immediate action is necessary beyond standard monitoring."

The scores are generally appropriate and justified, with no significant inconsistencies. Slight adjustments could be made to reflect the degree of suspicion more conservatively, but current scores are reasonable."
