  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated with no evidence of malicious activity or data exfiltration. The suspicion is limited to obfuscation itself, which does not confirm malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and reflect a low threat level, with obfuscation being the primary concern. No immediate action is necessary beyond standard monitoring."
