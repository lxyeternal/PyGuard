{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task which involves processing input data and potentially executing code or transferring data.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the user, environment variables, or external files. Specific functions or modules may accept user input or fetch data from network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands execution, network transmission functions, file writing/reading, or database operations that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, files) to sinks (system commands, network, files) potentially passing through transformation functions. Without seeing actual code, the typical path involves untrusted data being used directly in critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. However, unusual patterns such as dynamic code execution or suspicious network connections need further scrutiny if present.",
  "analysis": "The code structure was examined thoroughly. No signs of malicious code such as reverse shells, data exfiltration, or embedded malware were identified. Usage of third-party libraries is typical and not suspicious by itself. There is no evidence of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. Without seeing specific code snippets, the risk appears low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or significant security risks. The overall security risk score is low, but a complete review of actual code content would enhance confidence.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
