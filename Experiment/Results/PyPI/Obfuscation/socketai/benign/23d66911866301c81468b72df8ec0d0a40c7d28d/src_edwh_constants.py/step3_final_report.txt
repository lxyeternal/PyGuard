  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Potential data inputs such as environment variables, user inputs, network data, or file reads.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, system commands, file modifications, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs or external communications).",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval/exec, hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, or unusual code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The absence of eval/exec or suspicious network activity supports a low malware risk. Slight concerns about dynamic execution patterns in some reports are noted but not confirmed. Scores are consistent with the described code behavior, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0. and risk scores generally low (~0.2). The only exception is a cautious potential risk in Report 3, which is justified if untrusted inputs or eval/exec are involved, but without explicit evidence, the overall risk remains low.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code is assessed as benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation detected. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No significant security threats are identified, and the overall security posture is low risk.",
