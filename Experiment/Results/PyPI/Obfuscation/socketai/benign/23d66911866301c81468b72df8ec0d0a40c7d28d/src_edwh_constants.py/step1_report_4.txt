  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard Python module intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose indicated by the visible code.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from standard input, files, or environment variables (if any present). Specific source points are not evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data is written to output functions, files, or network calls if present. No explicit sink points are visible from the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks is not clearly established in the given code snippet, indicating standard data handling without suspicious pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs are evident. The code structure appears normal; no obfuscation or misleading variables detected.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the entire code reveals typical programming patterns with no malicious or suspicious behaviors. The code utilizes standard library functions and follows normal control flow. No code injection, data leakage, or insecure operations are apparent. No external network activity, system modifications, or cryptominers are observed. The absence of hardcoded secrets and the straightforward logic suggest low likelihood of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, with no evidence of malware or security risks. It performs standard data processing tasks without suspicious behavior. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code is safe for use.",
