  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Docker utility for inspecting and managing containers, with some obfuscation and dynamic command execution. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The primary concern is variable obfuscation and potential command injection if inputs are not sanitized, but current usage appears safe. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero."
