{
  "purpose": "Container management and inspection functions interacting with Docker CLI, parsing JSON outputs to retrieve container statuses, IDs, and health information.",
  "sources": "Run commands via Context.run() to execute Docker CLI commands, such as 'docker ps', 'docker inspect', and 'docker compose ps'.",
  "sinks": "JSON parsing of command outputs, warnings, print statements, and return of data structures containing container info.",
  "flows": "Input data (container names, IDs) flow into command strings; command outputs are captured and parsed into Python data structures; no untrusted data flows into sensitive sinks beyond command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic command string construction with variables; obfuscated variable names in some functions; use of shell=True in subprocess calls; minor variable naming issues that could indicate obfuscation or code quality concerns.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with Docker via CLI commands, processes JSON outputs, and manages container statuses. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscated variable names are used, which reduce readability but are not inherently malicious. The dynamic command strings could pose injection risks if inputs are uncontrolled, but within this context, inputs appear controlled. The use of warnings.warn for deprecation is benign. Overall, the code performs standard container management tasks without evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Docker utility for inspecting and managing containers, with some obfuscation and dynamic command execution. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are detected. The primary concern is variable obfuscation and potential command injection if inputs are not sanitized, but current usage appears safe. The security risk is low, and the malware score is zero.",
