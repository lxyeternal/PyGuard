{
  "purpose": "Module setup importing various utilities, constants, and submodules, with signs of obfuscation and suspicious warning filter argument.",
  "sources": "Import statements, variable assignments, and warnings filter line",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flow or external interactions observed",
  "flows": "Import statements and variable initializations; no runtime data flow or untrusted input handling",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., YLumXBtKgclEtuFIhZWlkNPJTMWBmjxr), suspicious warnings filter argument 'VjHTnFtVtHRKjUVdiTfHFccUVEQhigjy=CryptographyDeprecationWarning' which appears malformed or nonsensical",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of import statements with obfuscated identifiers and a suspicious warnings filter line. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscation and malformed warning argument suggest possible concealment or auto-generation, but no direct malicious behavior is evident. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, as no malicious activity is detected. Obfuscation scores are moderate to high, justified by variable naming patterns. Security risk remains low due to lack of active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module setup with signs of obfuscation and suspicious warning filter argument, but no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The current scores are consistent with the static analysis. Further dynamic or full code review is recommended to confirm no hidden malicious behavior.",
