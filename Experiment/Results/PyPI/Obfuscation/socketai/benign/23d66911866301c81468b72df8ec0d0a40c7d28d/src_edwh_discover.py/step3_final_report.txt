{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign Python utility or data processing module, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, user input, and possibly performs system or network operations, but no suspicious data sources are identified.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes to files, network sockets, or system resources, but no untrusted data flows or malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks like network or file output, with no suspicious transformations or injections observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual dynamic execution functions such as eval or exec are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard data processing and system interactions. No suspicious patterns, malicious network activity, or obfuscation techniques are detected. The confidence level is high (0.9), given the lack of code snippets indicating malicious intent. The scores reflect this assessment, with malware and obfuscated scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 to account for general caution in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the overall assessment indicates a safe dependency. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
