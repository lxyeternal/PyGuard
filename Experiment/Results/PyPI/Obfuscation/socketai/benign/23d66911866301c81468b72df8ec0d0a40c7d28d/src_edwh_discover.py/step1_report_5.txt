{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to perform some data processing or utility functions involving external modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from imported modules and possibly from environment variables or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communications, file writes, or execution of commands if such code exists, but none are explicitly shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user input, environment, or modules) to processing functions, and potentially to outputs or side effects like file/network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious functions are observed. The code structure appears standard, with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code reveals that it imports standard and third-party modules, with no indications of malicious behavior such as network connections to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated segments are present. The code's logic appears typical for utility functions, with proper handling of inputs and outputs. Absence of dynamic code execution, suspicious imports, or hidden behaviors suggests low malicious intent. Without specific external or hidden dependencies, there are no immediate security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a benign utility module with standard practices. The overall security risk is low, with high confidence in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
