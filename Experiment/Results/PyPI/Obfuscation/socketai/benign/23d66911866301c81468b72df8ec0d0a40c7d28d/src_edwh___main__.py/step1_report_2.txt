{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing or system operations, but the exact intent is unclear without detailed inspection.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from local files, environment variables, and possibly user input (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, subprocess calls, or data writes to files or external systems.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (files/env/input) to sinks (network, files, subprocesses), potentially passing through processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious function calls are visible. No obfuscated code, but lack of comments makes analysis harder. No unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code has been examined at multiple points, including initial setup, core processing functions, and termination. No malicious payloads such as network exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors are evident. Usage of standard libraries suggests typical functionality. The absence of cryptic code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns indicates low likelihood of hidden malicious intent. However, limited context prevents full certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the visible code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The script appears to perform its intended functions without evident security risks. The overall security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
