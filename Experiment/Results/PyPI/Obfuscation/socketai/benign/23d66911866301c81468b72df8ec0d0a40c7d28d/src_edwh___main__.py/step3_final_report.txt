  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and code anomalies.",
  "sources": "Potential input sources include environment variables, user inputs, file reads, and network calls.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve network transmissions, file writes, system calls, or environment variable access that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through code execution paths to sinks (outputs or external systems), possibly involving dynamic execution or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious patterns such as dynamic code execution (`exec`, `eval`), hardcoded secrets, obfuscated variable names, or unusual control flow structures.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with some reports indicating dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation. These patterns suggest moderate suspicion but lack definitive malicious code snippets. The confidence scores reflect this, with higher confidence in benign assessments and moderate confidence where suspicious patterns are noted. The malware scores align with the suspicion levels, with the highest in Report 3 due to observed dynamic execution and secrets. Obfuscation scores are consistent with the presence of obfuscated variables. Overall, the assessments are justified based on the described patterns, with minor room for adjustment if concrete code snippets confirm or refute suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; however, certain patterns like dynamic execution and obfuscation in Report 3 raise moderate suspicion. The scores are generally appropriate and justified, with no significant inconsistencies. Slight adjustments could be made to reflect the degree of suspicion more conservatively, but current scores are reasonable.",
