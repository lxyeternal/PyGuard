  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; however, certain patterns like dynamic execution and obfuscation in Report 3 raise moderate suspicion. The scores are generally appropriate and justified, with no significant inconsistencies. Slight adjustments could be made to reflect the degree of suspicion more conservatively, but current scores are reasonable."
