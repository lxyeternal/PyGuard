  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a package management utility with no active malware detected. However, its use of dynamic command execution without input validation and obfuscated/incomplete code snippets pose security risks, especially command injection vulnerabilities. It warrants cautious review, input sanitization, and code clarification before deployment in security-sensitive contexts."
