  "purpose": "Package setup and module import configuration for a Python project, including version handling and export definitions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_version, _reader, _writer), reading version info, and defining __all__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows; no network, file, or environment variable operations.",
  "flows": "Import source (_version) to alias variable, fallback to 'unknown'; static import of modules to __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name for version info, use of try-except block, minimal code structure, no external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a version string with an obfuscated alias, with a fallback. It also imports reader and writer modules, then defines __all__ for exports. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be stylistic or for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no network operations, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The obfuscation is minor and typical in some projects, not necessarily malicious. The fallback to 'unknown' is standard. Overall, the code is a benign package setup snippet with minor obfuscation, no malicious activity, and minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscated variable names serving likely stylistic or minor concealment purposes. No evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security vulnerabilities is present. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate, with a moderate obfuscation score reflecting variable name obscurity.",
