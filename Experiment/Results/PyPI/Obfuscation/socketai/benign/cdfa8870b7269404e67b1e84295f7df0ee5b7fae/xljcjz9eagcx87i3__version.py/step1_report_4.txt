{
  "purpose": "Assign version information to variables, likely for package metadata or version control.",
  "sources": "Constant string '0.3.0' assigned to a variable, and a tuple (0, 3, 0) assigned to another variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Assignment from constant values to variables; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly random variable names; no meaningful operations or security-sensitive code; no hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two variable assignments with constant values, which appear to be version identifiers. The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, but they do not execute any logic, perform input/output, or interact with external systems. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. The structure and content suggest benign metadata initialization.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, merely setting version variables with no malicious intent or security risks. The unusual variable names do not indicate malicious behavior but could be obfuscated naming. Overall, the code appears safe.",
