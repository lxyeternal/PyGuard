{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information, likely for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning string and tuple values to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, user input, or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly random variable names without context; no clear malicious activity. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two variable assignments: one string indicating a version ('0.3.0') and one tuple with version components (0, 3, 0). Variable names appear obfuscated or random, but this alone is not malicious. There are no data inputs, no data leaks, no external network operations, and no suspicious behaviors. The code is straightforward and typical for version declarations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as version metadata. No malicious intent or security risks detected.",
