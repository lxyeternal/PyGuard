  "purpose": "Assign version information to variables, likely for package versioning or configuration.",
  "sources": "Code assigns string and tuple values to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual for standard code; no meaningful context provided.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two variable assignments with obfuscated names. No input, external data, or control flow is present. The variable values are static literals. The naming does not follow typical conventions, which could suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or data leakage. There are no functions, network calls, or other suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to set version-related variables with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior, malicious data flow, or security issues are evident. The obfuscated variable names may suggest an attempt at concealment, but without additional context, this appears benign.",
