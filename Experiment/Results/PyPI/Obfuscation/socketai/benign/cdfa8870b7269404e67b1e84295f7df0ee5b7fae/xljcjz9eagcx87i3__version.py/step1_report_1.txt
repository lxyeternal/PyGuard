{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version information, likely for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning string and tuple values to variables.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Variables are assigned obfuscated or non-descriptive names, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and a tuple representing version components to variables with non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated names. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets beyond version info, and no suspicious network or file operations. The variable names might be intentionally obscure, but this is common in some codebases and does not necessarily indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as version metadata with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
