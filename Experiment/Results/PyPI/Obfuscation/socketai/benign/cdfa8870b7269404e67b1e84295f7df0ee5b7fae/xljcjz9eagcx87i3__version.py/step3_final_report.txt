  "purpose": "Assigns version information to variables, serving as metadata for a package.",
  "sources": "Variables 'SAmjkdLdmLXwoddPePmswCvZXQtxhwex' and 'TRuCXnXvgnmykapHhwWmjakFOSTfgMRu' hold static version data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of static strings and tuples to obfuscated variables; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names without descriptive identifiers; no malicious code or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, assigning version info to obfuscated variables. No external inputs, network activity, or code execution. Obfuscation is present but not indicative of malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores at 0. The obfuscation scores vary but are justified given the variable names. No security risks or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as version metadata with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
