{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version-related variables, likely for a package or module.",
  "sources": "Assignments of string '0.3.0' and tuple (0, 3, 0) to variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, output, or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are assigned static values",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, which do not follow typical naming conventions; no explicit malicious behavior or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns hardcoded version information to variables with unusual variable names. No input/output operations, network calls, or code execution are present. The variable names are obfuscated but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simply defining version variables with obfuscated names. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
