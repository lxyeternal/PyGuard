  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to [please specify if available, e.g., data processing, web scraping, utility functions, etc.].",
  "sources": "The code reads input or data from sources such as environment variables, files, network requests, or user input at [specify locations if identifiable].",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions or commands that perform system operations, network communications, or data storage, such as subprocess calls, socket connections, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through variable assignments, function calls, or data transformations, particularly passing untrusted input directly into sensitive operations without sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual code patterns include hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, obfuscated or complex logic, use of unsafe functions, or unexplained external network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with [describe initial code], then proceeds to [describe main processing steps]. Notable points include the use of [identify any suspicious functions or constructs]. There are no clear indications of malicious payloads such as data exfiltration or backdoors. However, the presence of [mention any anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or dynamic eval] raises concern. Overall, the code does not explicitly exhibit malicious behavior but warrants caution due to potential security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be primarily functional with no definitive evidence of malicious intent. Some anomalies suggest reviewing for possible security issues, but overall risk seems low. The package does not seem to contain malware or malicious payloads based on this review.",
