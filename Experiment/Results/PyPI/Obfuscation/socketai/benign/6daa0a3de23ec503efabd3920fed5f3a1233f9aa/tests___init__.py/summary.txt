  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but Report 3's suspicious traits justify a high malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.8) score, with a high security risk (0.7). Report 4 warrants a moderate risk (0.45) due to dynamic code execution. The other reports are consistent with low or no malicious activity. The overall assessment indicates cautious but justified scoring, with no immediate need for adjustment."
