  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Potentially untrusted input sources such as environment variables, user input, network data, or files.",
  "sinks": "Sensitive functions like system commands, network communication, data storage, or dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted sources flow into sinks via functions like eval/exec, network calls, or file operations, possibly leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or dynamic code execution without clear intent.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion when eval/exec are used with untrusted input, especially if obfuscated or communicating externally. Reports 3 and 4 show notable anomalies justifying higher malware and risk scores. Reports 1, 2, and 5 are consistent with benign or low-risk code, with no significant anomalies. The scores assigned align with the described behaviors, with Report 3 showing the highest malicious potential due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. The moderate concern in Report 4 is justified by eval/exec usage. Overall, the scoring reflects the evidence accurately.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but Report 3's suspicious traits justify a high malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.8) score, with a high security risk (0.7). Report 4 warrants a moderate risk (0.45) due to dynamic code execution. The other reports are consistent with low or no malicious activity. The overall assessment indicates cautious but justified scoring, with no immediate need for adjustment.",
