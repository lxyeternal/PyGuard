      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious activity. Malware scores are correctly set to 0. Obfuscation is present but does not indicate malicious intent. Risk scores should be slightly lowered to reflect the benign nature. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, consisting of internal static imports with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The overall risk is low, but further review of the imported modules is advised to ensure they do not contain hidden malicious code."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated API documentation generator with no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but it does not appear to contain malware or backdoors based on static analysis. The primary concern is the potential misuse of dynamic reflection and complex code paths if inputs are compromised."

      "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, benign type validation with obfuscated naming and suspicious import statements. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or activity. The obfuscation warrants further review of the broader codebase, but based solely on this snippet, it is considered safe. The malware score remains at 0, with a low security risk score, but the obfuscation should be addressed for maintainability."

      "conclusion": "The analyzed code functions as a set of Flask request handling utilities with significant obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or system compromise. The primary concern is the obfuscated naming, which warrants further review in a broader security context, but based solely on this code, it appears benign."

      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, but Report 3's suspicious traits justify a high malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.8) score, with a high security risk (0.7). Report 4 warrants a moderate risk (0.45) due to dynamic code execution. The other reports are consistent with low or no malicious activity. The overall assessment indicates cautious but justified scoring, with no immediate need for adjustment."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Flask API test suite with static secrets and complex decorators. No active malware or malicious payloads are detected, but the obfuscation and static credentials create a moderate security risk if misused in production. Vigilance and refactoring to remove obfuscation and replace static secrets are recommended before deployment."
