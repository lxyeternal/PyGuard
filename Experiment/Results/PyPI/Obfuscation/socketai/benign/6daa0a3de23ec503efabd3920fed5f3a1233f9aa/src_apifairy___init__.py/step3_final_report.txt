  "purpose": "Static import statements from internal modules with obfuscated identifiers, likely part of package setup or internal structure.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .core, .decorators, and .fields modules with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static imports do not process external input or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution beyond import statements; no source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers in import statements, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements from internal modules with obfuscated names. No executable logic, data processing, network activity, or external communication is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not directly indicate malicious intent. Malware scores are low (0 or 0.1), reflecting no evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.8), consistent with the naming pattern. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), appropriate given the static nature of the code. Further inspection of the imported modules is recommended to rule out hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, consisting of internal static imports with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The overall risk is low, but further review of the imported modules is advised to ensure they do not contain hidden malicious code.",
