  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, consisting of internal static imports with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. The overall risk is low, but further review of the imported modules is advised to ensure they do not contain hidden malicious code."
