{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an initializer that stores two parameters as instance variables.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from sources to sinks in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could indicate intentional obfuscation or concealment, but no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code introduces a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The constructor stores two parameters as instance variables. There are no external data inputs, network activity, or other behaviors that could be malicious. The obfuscated naming may be suspicious in some contexts but could also be benign obfuscation. No indicators of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely defines a custom exception class with obfuscated naming; it does not perform any malicious actions or contain security risks. The obfuscation alone is not sufficient to classify it as malicious, though it warrants cautious review if part of a larger suspicious codebase.",
