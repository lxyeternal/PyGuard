  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious activity. Malware scores are correctly set to 0. Obfuscation is present but does not indicate malicious intent. Risk scores should be slightly lowered to reflect the benign nature. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern."
