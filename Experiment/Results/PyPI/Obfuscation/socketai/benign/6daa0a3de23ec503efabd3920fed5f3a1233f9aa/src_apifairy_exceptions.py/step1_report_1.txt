  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition, possibly used for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No input sources; no data reading operations.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication points present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; class only defines an exception with an initializer.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive class name and variable names; no evidence of malicious code or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with an __init__ method that assigns parameters to instance variables. There are no external calls, data transmissions, or suspicious code patterns. Variable and class names are intentionally obfuscated, but this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward custom exception class with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
