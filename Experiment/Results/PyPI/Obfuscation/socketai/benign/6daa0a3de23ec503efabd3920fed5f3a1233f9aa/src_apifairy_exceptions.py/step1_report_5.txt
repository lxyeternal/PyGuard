{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with an initializer storing two parameters.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; class and method definitions without data input or external data reads.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; class is purely definitional.",
  "anomalies": "Unusually obfuscated class name; no apparent practical purpose; no other suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception subclass with a cryptic name, inheriting from Exception. The __init__ method stores two parameters as instance variables. No external data reads, no use of environment variables, network calls, or other suspicious activities. The class appears to serve as a custom exception placeholder, potentially obfuscated but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with obfuscated naming but no malicious intent or security risks. It lacks any suspicious behavior or malicious code segments.",
