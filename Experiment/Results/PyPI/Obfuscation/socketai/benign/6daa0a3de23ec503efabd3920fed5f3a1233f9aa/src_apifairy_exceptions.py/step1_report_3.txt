  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition for handling specific errors with associated messages",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines a class and its constructor",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data flows, input/output, or external interactions",
  "flows": "No data flow present, as the class only stores provided arguments",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class name, but no malicious activity or suspicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with a non-descriptive, obfuscated class name. The constructor stores two parameters as instance variables. No external data input, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be a standard class definition with obfuscated naming, which might be a pattern to evade detection, but it does not contain malicious behavior itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception, with obfuscated naming but no malicious intent or security issues identified.",
