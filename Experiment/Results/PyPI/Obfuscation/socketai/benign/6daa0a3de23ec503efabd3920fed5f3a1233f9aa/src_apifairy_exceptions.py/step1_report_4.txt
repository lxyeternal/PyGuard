  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class with an initializer to store specific data attributes.",
  "sources": "The class constructor parameters 'SjyFKbDslhqMvbWmLVoPoumcqhjhTgdw' and 'messages'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or file I/O.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are assigned to class instance variables; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no apparent malicious activity or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The __init__ method assigns input parameters to instance variables, possibly to store contextual information when the exception is raised. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but this does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no external calls, data leaks, or suspicious patterns present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a custom exception with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this fragment.",
