{
  "purpose": "This code module imports several enumerations from the 'gw.enums' package and defines an export list for these enums.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'gw.enums' submodules",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; only static imports and __all__ declaration",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply imports constants and exports them",
  "anomalies": "The imported enum names are obfuscated and appear to be randomly generated, which is unusual for standard enum naming conventions. There is no actual data processing or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements of enumerations with obfuscated names, followed by a list exporting these enums. There is no evidence of data flow, dynamic execution, or handling of untrusted input. The obfuscated enum names may indicate code that was generated or intentionally obscured, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The code does not perform any operations or contain any hidden or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module importing predefined enums and exporting them for use elsewhere. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The obfuscated names are unusual but not inherently malicious.",
