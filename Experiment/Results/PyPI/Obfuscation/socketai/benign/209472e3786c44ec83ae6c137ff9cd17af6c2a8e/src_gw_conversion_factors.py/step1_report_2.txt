  "sinks": "Division operation involving pgcmJfaBmvlsARmAzEfwubTfXIFpxCEg and HPTGoLmzTWPxxYtWKaMLyBRyxLQeiLgq, result stored in variable, no external output or data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Variable initialization flows into subsequent calculations; no data from untrusted sources, no outputs to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Variables are named with seemingly random strings; no input handling, no external data sources, no apparent user interaction.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward variable assignments and a division operation. All variables are statically assigned, with no input validation, external data sources, or dynamic code execution. The naming appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no suspicious data leaks, no network activity, and no backdoors or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple, self-contained calculations with no malicious behavior detected. The unusual variable names suggest obfuscation, but this is not inherently malicious. No security risks or malware indicators are present based on this snippet.",
