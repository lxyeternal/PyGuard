{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform simple arithmetic calculations, likely for data processing or configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hard-coded variables: AZhUmkoYYlYqovAOVucbfytwNZLzDrfp, pgcmJfaBmvlsARmAzEfwubTfXIFpxCEg, HPTGoLmzTWPxxYtWKaMLyBRyxLQeiLgq, veHwykqOzfsuEkNygAFQmlVgsqVVmmex, and UhtIHyWdgwBlChNsdjYmFopiJuxcKFjA.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks are present; the code performs internal calculations only, with no output or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "The variables are assigned and used internally in calculations, with no external data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are present. Variable names are nonsensical but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns constants to variables, performs a division operation, and uses these variables in calculations. There are no external inputs, no data leaks, no use of environment variables, and no network activity. The structure is straightforward and does not exhibit signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and performs basic arithmetic operations with hard-coded values. There is no evidence of malicious intent, security risks, or supply chain sabotage.",
