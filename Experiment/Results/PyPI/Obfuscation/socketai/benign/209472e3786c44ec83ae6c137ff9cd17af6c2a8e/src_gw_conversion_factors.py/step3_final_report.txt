{
  "purpose": "Performs basic calculations with hardcoded numeric values, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned static numeric values; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network connections, or output functions present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of constants to variables, followed by a division operation between two variables.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no dynamic code execution, secrets, or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, static, and performs simple arithmetic with obfuscated variable names. No external data flow, network activity, or malicious indicators are present. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is zero, and security risk is minimal. The obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming, but overall, the code is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is the only suspicious aspect but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
