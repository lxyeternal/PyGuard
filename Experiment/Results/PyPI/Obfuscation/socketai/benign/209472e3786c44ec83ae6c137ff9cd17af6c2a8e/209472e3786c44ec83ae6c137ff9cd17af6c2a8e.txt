The high obfuscation score reflects naming obscurity but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible."

The high obfuscation score is justified, but there is no evidence of malware or active security risks in this snippet. Further review of the entire package is recommended, but based solely on this fragment, the security risk is low."

It likely serves as a structural component or placeholder within a larger codebase. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall security risk remains low. No immediate concerns are identified."

The obfuscation and placeholder data warrant caution, but based on the static analysis, it does not pose an active security threat. The overall security risk is low, though the obfuscation could be exploited to hide malicious payloads if further context is provided."

The superficial obfuscation and placeholder mappings suggest an attempt to conceal complexity but do not indicate active malicious behavior. Overall, it poses low security risk but warrants ongoing review if integrated into larger systems."
