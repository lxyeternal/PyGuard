  "purpose": "Defines an enum class with various class methods for value retrieval and mapping related to market price units.",
  "sources": "Imports, class methods accessing class variables, dictionary lookups, and input parameters such as 'symbol' and 'btENOSSdZBjZJYosoXYuzWwuplzrzwxO'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable methods that perform key lookups in dictionaries using untrusted inputs ('symbol', 'btENOSSdZBjZJYosoXYuzWwuplzrzwxO'), and the method 'MmAinsCSgiqSuwAvLnRHkXSOcHlIODRH' which raises errors based on string inputs.",
  "flows": "Input parameters 'symbol' and 'btENOSSdZBjZJYosoXYuzWwuplzrzwxO' flow into dictionary lookups; 'symbol' is used to retrieve mapping values, 'btENOSSdZBjZJYosoXYuzWwuplzrzwxO' determines values from pre-defined dicts, potentially exposing key-based data.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions (obfuscated identifiers), dictionary initializations with placeholder values, use of class methods that perform lookups without validation on input sources, and the presence of placeholder mappings like '000' and 'USDPerMWh' with minimal context. The method 'MmAinsCSgiqSuwAvLnRHkXSOcHlIODRH' raises errors on invalid types, indicating input validation but no apparent malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class methods to retrieve constants or map values based on string inputs, with some methods performing dictionary key lookups. The dictionaries are initialized with placeholder data, and the code contains obfuscated variable names, which complicates understanding. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious side-effects. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. Input validation appears to be in place for certain methods, reducing risk of injection. Overall, the code functions as a configuration or mapping utility with obfuscated identifiers but no malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a utility for handling market unit values and mappings with obfuscated naming and placeholder data. There are no indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The use of placeholder mappings and obfuscation suggests possible attempt to hide details but does not indicate malware. The overall security risk is low.",
