{
  "purpose": "This code defines an obfuscated enum-like class with methods for value retrieval, validation, and static mappings related to market units and currency codes.",
  "sources": "Class methods accessing internal dictionaries and class variables, including dictionary comprehensions and static data.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; internal class methods operate on static mappings and class attributes.",
  "flows": "Methods retrieve or validate data from internal dictionaries based on input parameters; no external data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, placeholder values ('000', 'USDPerMWh'), and malformed dictionary comprehension referencing an undefined variable, which would cause runtime errors.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated, likely auto-generated or designed to conceal its purpose. It manages static mappings and enum-like behavior without external data interaction. The malformed comprehension indicates potential obfuscation or incomplete code, but no evidence of malicious activity such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system manipulation is present. The obfuscation and malformed constructs are suspicious but do not constitute active malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated configuration or enum management code with no signs of malicious intent. The heavy obfuscation and potential runtime errors suggest caution and further manual review, but there is no direct evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
