  "purpose": "Defines an enum-like class for currency units with methods for retrieval, validation, and mapping between symbols and names.",
  "sources": "Class methods accessing class variables, dictionaries mapping currency codes to names, and input parameters for validation.",
  "sinks": "Methods returning currency codes, names, or default values; validation functions raising exceptions on invalid input.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., currency symbols) flow into validation functions, which access dictionaries to return corresponding values or defaults.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and method names; placeholder mappings ('000', 'UNKNOWN'); broken or suspicious dictionary comprehensions referencing undefined variables; import from an opaque module 'gw.enums'.",
  "analysis": "The code employs heavy obfuscation with meaningless identifiers and placeholder data, such as mapping all currency codes to '000' or 'UNKNOWN'. Several methods perform validation and mapping, but some contain syntax errors or references to undefined variables, indicating incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code. No network activity, file operations, or system manipulations are present. The placeholder mappings and obfuscation could be used to hide malicious logic, but no direct malicious activity or backdoors are evident from static analysis. The broken comprehension and placeholder data suggest the code is either incomplete or designed to conceal intent, but without active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with placeholder mappings and some syntax issues, but there is no evidence of malicious activity or malicious intent. The obfuscation and placeholder data warrant caution, but based on the static analysis, it does not pose an active security threat. The overall security risk is low, though the obfuscation could be exploited to hide malicious payloads if further context is provided.",
