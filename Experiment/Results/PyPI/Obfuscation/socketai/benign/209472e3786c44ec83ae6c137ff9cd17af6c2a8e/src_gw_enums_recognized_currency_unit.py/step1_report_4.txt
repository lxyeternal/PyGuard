{
  "purpose": "This code defines an enum-like class for recognized currency units, with methods for mapping, validation, and retrieval of currency symbols and codes.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from method parameters (e.g., 'btENOSSdZBjZJYosoXYuzWwuplzrzwxO', 'symbol'), and from class variables such as 'igCXaDmfXNrKDXCDVYsdvPBYwTYqwwPP' and 'zagNLHbRqRQFCZxgWvdMYCQmMNaTCzRP'.",
  "sinks": "Returns values based on input parameters, but no actual data sinks or external data transmission are present.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated and mapped through internal dictionaries; no external data flow or network activity occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'igCXaDmfXNrKDXCDVYsdvPBYwTYqwwPP', 'zagNLHbRqRQFCZxgWvdMYCQmMNaTCzRP') suggests code obfuscation. Dictionaries are initialized with string mappings, but with repetitive placeholder values ('000'). The class methods return static strings and dictionary lookups, with no dynamic or external data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement an enum-like class for recognized currency units, with methods for retrieving currency codes, mapping symbols, and validation. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which is a common indicator of attempts to hide functionality. The dictionaries used for mapping ('igCXaDmfXNrKDXCDVYsdvPBYwTYqwwPP', 'zagNLHbRqRQFCZxgWvdMYCQmMNaTCzRP') contain placeholder or repetitive mappings ('000'), which could suggest incomplete implementation or deliberate obfuscation. No network activity, file I/O, or external data transmission is present, and the code does not appear to perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated implementation of a currency recognition and validation utility. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware, but the obfuscation and placeholder mappings suggest it may be incomplete or intentionally obscured. It does not contain malicious intent based on the analyzed code.",
