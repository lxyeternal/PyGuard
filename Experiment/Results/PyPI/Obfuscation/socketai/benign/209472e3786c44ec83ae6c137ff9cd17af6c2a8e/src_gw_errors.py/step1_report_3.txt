{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names",
  "sources": "Class definitions at the start of the code",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or untrusted input handling present",
  "flows": "None; no data flows or source-to-sink paths observed",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class names that do not serve clear functionality; no functional code beyond class declarations",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of four custom exception classes with intentionally obfuscated names. There are no data inputs, no handling, and no operations that could lead to security issues. The obfuscation of class names could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but in isolation, defining empty exception classes is benign. There are no suspicious behaviors, malicious payloads, or secret handling detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines obfuscated custom exception classes without any functional or malicious behavior. While obfuscation can sometimes indicate malicious intent, in this context, it appears to serve as a basic, possibly obfuscatory, coding style without malicious activity.",
