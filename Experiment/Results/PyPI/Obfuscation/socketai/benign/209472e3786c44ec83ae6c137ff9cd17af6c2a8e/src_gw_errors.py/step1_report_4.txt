  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger Python project.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; only class definitions for exceptions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class declarations with no methods or logic.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated class names that appear to be random strings. No actual implementation or logic included.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with obfuscated names, which do not contain any logic, data handling, or security-sensitive operations. The class names do not correspond to meaningful identifiers, and there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful actions. This pattern might be used to obfuscate intent, but on its own, it does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines several uniquely named exception classes with no methods or behavior. It appears obfuscated but contains no malicious code or security risks. The unusual class names could be an attempt at obfuscation, but without further context, it is benign.",
