  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with exception inheritance, no input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing, no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; only class declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly random or obfuscated class names; no other unusual code behavior or security-related actions.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of defining custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There are no input sources, data handling, or sinks. The naming pattern suggests possible obfuscation or intentional concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any actions beyond class declarations.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a set of obfuscated exception class definitions without any malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual naming may suggest obfuscation but does not inherently imply malicious intent.",
