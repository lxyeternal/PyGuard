{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names for potential use in larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output actions detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink; classes are not instantiated or used here.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple classes with highly obfuscated, non-descriptive names; no functional code or comments explaining purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of defining four custom exception classes with intentionally obfuscated names. There are no methods, no data handling, no input/output operations, and no logic. Obfuscated class names may suggest an attempt to hide intent or complicate understanding, but without additional code, it does not indicate malicious behavior per se. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious actions are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated setup for custom exceptions, possibly part of a larger project. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could hinder code review but does not imply malicious intent on its own.",
