  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names.\n- No data input, output, or logic is present.\n- The obfuscation appears to be solely in class naming, not in behavior.\n- No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network operations, or backdoors, are evident.\n- The reports uniformly conclude benign intent, with no security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed review per report:**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Obfuscated exception classes, possibly for error handling or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe code is benign, and the reasoning aligns with the minimal code. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Define custom exception classes.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, the code is harmless. The low scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Define obfuscated exception classes.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous findings; no malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Obfuscated exception classes.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nNo issues; scores align with the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Obfuscated exception classes.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.9\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, consistent with the previous assessments.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary and recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code's simplicity, malware scores should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** The high obfuscation scores are justified due to the nonsensical class names.\n- **Risk scores:** Since the code is purely definitional with no behavior, risk scores should be very low, ideally around 0.1 or less. Report 5's risk score of 0.2 is slightly higher but still acceptable given the obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Final assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores for this code:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.8-0.9** (consistent with class name obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** **0.1** (minimal, due to obfuscation alone)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, and the scoring reflects that. No adjustments are necessary unless additional context from the larger codebase suggests otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Note:**  \nIf this pattern appears elsewhere with more code, further review would be necessary. But based solely on these snippets, the current scores and reasoning are appropriate.",
