{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for error handling or as a form of code obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions for custom exceptions; no input or data reading mechanisms present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potentially harmful operations identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; classes are standalone definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical, obfuscated class names that resemble random strings; no meaningful logic, only class declarations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of four custom exception class definitions with obfuscated, nonsensical names. There are no functions, no data input, no external interactions, and no logic or behavior that could indicate malicious intent. The purpose appears to be either placeholder code, code obfuscation, or an attempt to conceal real functionality. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors, are present. The code is minimal and does not execute any harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines obfuscated custom exception classes without any malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be either placeholder, intentionally obfuscated, or part of a larger codebase. No immediate security threats are identifiable.",
