  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, obfuscated import/export statement with no signs of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but there is no evidence of malware or active security risks in this snippet. Further review of the entire package is recommended, but based solely on this fragment, the security risk is low."
