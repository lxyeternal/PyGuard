{
  "purpose": "Define enumerations and class methods, including placeholders for future implementation, with no immediate operational code.",
  "sources": "No active data input sources; class methods do not process external input data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; methods either return static data or raise exceptions.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; no active data processing or transmission occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class and method names, placeholder methods raising NotImplementedError, and a method that returns input argument unchanged. No clear purpose or functional logic. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of an Enum, with methods that either return static data, None, or raise exceptions. The method names and class names are intentionally obscure, which could suggest an attempt at obfuscation, but no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system access is evident. All methods are either placeholders or simple return statements. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a deliberately obfuscated placeholder module with no active malicious or security-related functionality. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present. It may be part of a larger, incomplete, or intentionally obscured package, but on its own, it poses no security threat.",
