{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated enum-based class with placeholder methods, likely serving as a structural or interface component without active logic.",
  "sources": "Class and method definitions; no external data sources or input handling observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external communications, or data processing points identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; methods are either trivial or raise NotImplementedError.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and method names; methods are placeholders; no active logic or data manipulation.",
  "analysis": "The code is an obfuscated, incomplete structure with no active or malicious behavior. Methods are either returning input, raising exceptions, or returning None. No network activity, data exfiltration, or security-sensitive operations are present. The obfuscation appears intentional for obscurity or placeholder purposes, not malicious intent. The lack of data flow or external interactions further supports benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated skeleton or interface with no signs of malicious activity or security threats. It likely serves as a structural component or placeholder within a larger codebase. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall security risk remains low. No immediate concerns are identified.",
