  "purpose": "Package setup script that reads version, description, dependencies, and configures package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads local files ('redis_utils/version', 'readme.rst', 'requirements.txt', 'test-requirements.txt') and imports setup modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processed maliciously; no network activity or external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Reads files into variables; no external or untrusted data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious. It performs straightforward file reads and module imports without network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation may be stylistic or concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are present. All evidence points to benign package configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero.",
