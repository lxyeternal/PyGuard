{
  "purpose": "The code clears all Redis keys and invokes bootstrap functions, likely for setup or reset purposes.",
  "sources": "Retrieves 'redis_conn' from kwargs and accesses its 'keys()' method to list Redis keys.",
  "sinks": "Deletes Redis keys via 'delete()' method; calls bootstrap functions which may execute further code.",
  "flows": "From 'redis_conn' to 'keys()' and 'delete()' methods, then to bootstrap function calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; dynamic invocation of bootstrap functions; destructive Redis key deletion without safeguards.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to instantiate an object with obfuscated parameters, retrieves a Redis connection, deletes all Redis keys, and calls a bootstrap function. No evidence of malicious payloads such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present. The obfuscation and destructive operations pose security concerns if misused. The malware score is low (0.2), reflecting no explicit malicious activity, but the high obfuscation (0.7) and potential for misuse justify a moderate security risk score (0.6). The destructive nature of deleting all Redis keys without safeguards increases the risk profile. Overall, the code is a utility that can be exploited maliciously but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but has high obfuscation and destructive capabilities that could be misused. The scores are appropriate, with a low malware likelihood but elevated risk due to potential misuse.",
