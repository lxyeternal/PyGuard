{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract base class with abstract properties and methods, possibly intended for subclassing and implementation.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class and method definitions with hardcoded string variables.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code primarily defines an abstract interface.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded string values within abstract property methods; no functional code or logic beyond class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an abstract class with multiple abstract properties and methods, each containing hardcoded string variables. The string values appear arbitrary and do not contribute to any apparent malicious activity. No external inputs, network connections, or suspicious behaviors are present. The class could be part of a larger framework, but in isolation, it does not exhibit malicious intent. The use of abstract properties and methods without concrete implementation suggests it is meant for subclassing, not malicious activity. No signs of data exfiltration, system manipulation, or malicious code are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a purely structural, abstract class definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. The hardcoded strings are likely placeholders or documentation markers. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
