  "conclusion": "The code functions as a macOS automation utility with significant system interaction capabilities and obfuscation. While no direct malicious payloads are evident, its potential for misuse warrants caution. The obfuscation and system access features elevate its security concern, especially in supply chain contexts. The malware score is estimated at 0.3, obfuscation at 0.6, and overall security risk at 0.5, indicating moderate concern due to potential covert activities and system manipulation capabilities."
