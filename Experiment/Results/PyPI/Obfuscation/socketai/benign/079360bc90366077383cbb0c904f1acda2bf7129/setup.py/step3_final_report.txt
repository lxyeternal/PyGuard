{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, utilizing functions to read configuration files such as requirements.txt, with obfuscated function and variable names.",
  "sources": "File reads from filenames like 'requirements.txt' and other local configuration files.",
  "sinks": "The code reads files and passes their contents to setup(), with no external data or untrusted input processed into dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads into variables used in the setup() call; no external or untrusted data is injected into critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names suggest concealment but do not indicate malicious intent; no network activity or code injection observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup tasks with obfuscated identifiers. Static analysis shows no malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation could be stylistic or an attempt to hide intent but does not constitute malicious behavior. File reading is performed safely without evident vulnerabilities. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the obfuscation score reflects the non-descriptive naming. The overall security risk remains low, around 0.2, due to obfuscation but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. The static analysis supports a low malware and security risk score, with obfuscation being the primary concern but not indicative of malicious intent.",
