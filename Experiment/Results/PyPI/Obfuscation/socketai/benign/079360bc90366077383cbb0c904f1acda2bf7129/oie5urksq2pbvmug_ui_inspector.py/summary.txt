  "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns consistent with covert data collection or surveillance, driven by obfuscation, external dependencies, and continuous polling. While no explicit malicious actions are visible, the design raises concerns about potential malicious intent, especially in supply chain scenarios. A malware score of approximately 0.6, an obfuscation score of 0.8, and a security risk score of 0.55 are justified based on the observed behavior."
