{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define a class with utility methods for string escaping, normalization, coordinate validation, and environment checking, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The only explicit source of data is the parameter 'wildcard' in method lKNjMHsfMooaQIEqTgbrNkMVVDxnHHlp, and 'QfuJFrKkzAmLKVeAMQbXRLfpzzoZfMoz' in NjKFNOLNUfmKrBavHZqaNlNJggffcSLf, as well as 'button_name' and 'supported_names' in rclOOzbtbwkqyusDzpArgiqejfDWRJLC. No input reading from external sources like network, files, or environment variables is evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network communication, file writing, or environment modification are present. No untrusted data flows to dangerous operations.",
  "flows": "Data flows involve string processing within methods, such as escaping or replacing characters, and validation of button names and coordinate types. No external data flow or untrusted source to sink is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes a mysterious import from a relative module ('..') and an obfuscated class and method naming scheme, which could suggest attempts at hiding intent. The initial variable 'gbPDptzclFBkelOXOzzIcejFCsJXsnHD' assigned an email address appears unused, possibly a marker or decoy. The method 'NjKFNOLNUfmKrBavHZqaNlNJggffcSLf' replaces specific unicode characters, which is normal but the naming is intentionally obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility methods for string escaping, normalization, coordinate validation, and environment version checking. No network, file, or sensitive data handling is present. The obfuscation and minimal data flow suggest an attempt to hide functionality, but nothing malicious such as data exfiltration, command execution, or system modification is evident. The initial variable with an email address seems unused, possibly an obfuscation or decoy. Overall, the code appears benign and intended for internal validation or string manipulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but functionally straightforward and does not contain malicious behavior. It seems to be utility code with no active malicious or suspicious operations. The lack of network or system modification operations reduces concern. The main risk lies in the obfuscation which could hide malicious intent, but based on this fragment alone, no malicious activity is detected.",
