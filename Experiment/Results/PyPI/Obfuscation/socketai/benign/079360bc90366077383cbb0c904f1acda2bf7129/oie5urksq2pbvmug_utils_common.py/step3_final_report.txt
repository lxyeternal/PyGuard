  "purpose": "Utility functions for regex pattern creation, string normalization, validation, and environment checks.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded email variable, input parameters to methods, environment info via sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "None directly; validation functions raise exceptions on invalid input",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow through validation and normalization functions; no external data or network activity",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and method names; hardcoded email address; relative import from parent directory",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for regex pattern generation, Unicode normalization, coordinate validation, button name validation, and environment version check. The presence of a hardcoded email 'f1ashhimself@gmail.com' appears unused and likely benign. Obfuscated naming may be intentional for internal concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, file operations, or system modifications are present. The functions raise custom exceptions for validation failures, which is standard. Overall, the code is benign, with minor anomalies such as obfuscation and embedded contact info.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with obfuscated identifiers and a hardcoded email, likely for internal or debugging purposes. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious sabotage. The low malware score is justified; obfuscation is high but typical of internal code. The embedded email does not indicate malicious intent but warrants caution. Overall, the code appears benign with minor anomalies.",
