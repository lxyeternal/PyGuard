  "purpose": "A Python class implementing a client for the Notion API, handling token retrieval, API requests with retries, pagination, and content extraction.",
  "sources": "Environment variable for token, API endpoints for blocks, databases, search, and page content.",
  "sinks": "API requests to Notion endpoints, data retrieval, and content processing; no data leaks or untrusted data effects observed.",
  "flows": "Token source (environment variable or constructor) → API request functions → data processing and pagination → content extraction.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or auto-generated but not malicious; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client for Notion, with secure token handling, retry logic, and pagination. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation used maliciously, or sabotage. Variable naming is obscure but not malicious. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious signals. Obfuscation is minor, justified by variable naming, scored around 0.2. The security risk is low (~0.1-0.2), given proper token management and standard API interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured Notion API client with no malicious activity or sabotage detected. The obfuscation is superficial and not malicious. The supply chain security risk is minimal. The scores are appropriate: malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.2, security risk = 0.2.",
