{
  "purpose": "The code implements a Python class for interacting with the Notion API, enabling fetching and querying pages, databases, and search results from Notion.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'NOTION_INTEGRATION_TOKEN' for the API token; HTTP request functions for API communication; input parameters like 'block_id', 'query', and list of page/database IDs.",
  "sinks": "Requests made via the 'requests' library to external Notion API endpoints; potential data leaks through API responses; environment variable access for API credentials.",
  "flows": "Environment variable retrieval for token → API request construction → API calls via 'requests' → Response handling and data extraction → Returning page IDs or content.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials other than environment variable; no suspicious URL endpoints; the code's structure is standard for API client libraries; no obfuscated code or unusual runtime behaviors; no data exfiltration or hidden network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as a client for the Notion API, with methods to fetch page contents, database IDs, and search results. It uses environment variables for credentials, which is standard. The request method includes retries with exponential backoff for rate limiting, indicating awareness of API limits but no malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present, and all external URLs and data handling appear intended for legitimate data retrieval. The overall structure and logic are consistent with typical API wrapper code. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious activities. It does not obfuscate its logic, and the code is straightforward in its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard Notion API client for data retrieval. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware. It uses environment variables securely for tokens and performs expected API interactions without suspicious payloads or network activity. The overall security risk is minimal.",
