  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function from the 'llama_index.readers.notion.base' module and define the publicly accessible objects.",
  "sources": "The import statement importing 'CWFLnAVuYygBTfuJdJhQJmbilIGxIJHx' from the module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or user input are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports and defines an export list.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'CWFLnAVuYygBTfuJdJhQJmbilIGxIJHx' appears as a non-descriptive, possibly obfuscated or placeholder identifier. No other code or context is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward import of an identically obscure object name from a module, and then sets an export list with a string 'NotionPageReader'. There are no functions, data processing, or logic. The import name does not reveal its purpose, which could be a form of obfuscation, but there is no active malicious behavior. No code injection, data leaks, or suspicious operations are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, performing a basic import and defining an export list. The import name's obfuscation could suggest an attempt to hide the real object, but with no further context, it does not indicate malicious activity. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are apparent.",
