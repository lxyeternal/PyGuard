  "purpose": "Minimal import of an obfuscated object from llama_index.readers.notion.base, likely for internal use or extension.",
  "sources": "Import statement from llama_index.readers.notion.base",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow, user input, or untrusted data processing present",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or non-descriptive imported name 'CWFLnAVuYygBTfuJdJhQJmbilIGxIJHx'",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with an __all__ declaration. The imported name appears obfuscated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No functions, data processing, or network activity are present. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. Security risk is low, given the minimal code and lack of active data handling. The obfuscated name warrants verification but is not definitive evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, performing a straightforward import with an obfuscated name. While the obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
