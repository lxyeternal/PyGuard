  "purpose": "Import the class CWFLnAVuYygBTfuJdJhQJmbilIGxIJHx from the notion base reader module for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a class from an external module within the llama_index.readers.notion.base package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code does not execute or evaluate untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external input to sinks; it's a straightforward import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The imported class name appears as a seemingly random string, which could indicate obfuscation or a placeholder, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from a module within a package and defines __all__ for export control. The class name appears non-descriptive and potentially obfuscated, which warrants caution, but there's no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors. The import itself is standard Python practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import statement with no apparent malicious behavior. The obfuscated class name may be unusual but is not inherently malicious. No security risks are evident based solely on this snippet.",

  "obfuscated": 0.6,
