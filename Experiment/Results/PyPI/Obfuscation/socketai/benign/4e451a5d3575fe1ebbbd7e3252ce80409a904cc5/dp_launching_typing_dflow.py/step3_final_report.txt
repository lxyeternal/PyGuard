  "purpose": "Utility classes for data serialization, schema updates, and configuration handling, with obfuscated class and method names.",
  "sources": "Input data via method parameters, class instantiations, and type checks.",
  "sinks": "Base64 encoding of input data, updating schema dictionaries, creating class instances.",
  "flows": "Input data → type checking → base64 encoding (if bytes) → class instantiation → schema update or data yield.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; exception messages referencing an undefined variable 'value'; consistent pattern of high obfuscation without malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple classes that perform data encoding (mainly base64) and schema updates, accepting various data types such as str, bytes, dict, or class instances. The obfuscated naming pattern suggests either auto-generated code or attempts to conceal intent. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious payloads are present. The exception messages referencing 'value' seem inconsistent, possibly due to obfuscation or code generation artifacts. Overall, the code appears to serve as utility modules for configuration or data serialization, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily handling data encoding and schema updates with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or malware is detected. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk remains low.",
