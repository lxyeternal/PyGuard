{
  "purpose": "The code is a relative import statement, likely intended to import all modules, functions, and variables from the current package/module.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement itself, which reads the current package or module's contents.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks in this code snippet, as it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code imports data from its own package/module but does not process or pass data further.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and typical for Python modules, with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs. The use of 'import *' can sometimes be discouraged but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement using relative import syntax. It does not perform any data processing, network communication, or system modification. As it stands, it neither shows nor suggests malicious behavior. The simplicity and lack of complexity or hidden behavior indicate a benign intent, assuming the broader context is a standard Python package.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is likely part of a larger module, and on its own, it does not pose any threat.",
