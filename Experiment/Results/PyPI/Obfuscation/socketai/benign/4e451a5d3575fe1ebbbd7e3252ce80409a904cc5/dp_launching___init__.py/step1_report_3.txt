{
  "purpose": "The code is a module import statement, intended to import all symbols from the current package.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement itself, which reads the current package's namespace.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as data output, network calls, or file operations in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible from a single import statement; it only affects the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from . import *' can obscure which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unwanted code, but the statement itself is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code is a standard Python relative import that imports all symbols from the current package. It does not contain any executable logic or data handling. Without additional context or code, it is impossible to determine malicious intent solely from this line. The use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution, but it does not indicate malicious behavior by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple relative import statement that does not show signs of malicious behavior on its own. It could be part of a larger package, and further code review is necessary to assess security risks. There are no apparent malicious actions or anomalous patterns in this single line.",
