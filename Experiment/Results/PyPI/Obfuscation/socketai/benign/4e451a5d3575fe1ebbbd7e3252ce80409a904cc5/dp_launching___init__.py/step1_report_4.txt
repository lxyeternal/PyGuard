{
  "purpose": "The code imports all modules and objects from the current package, which is a common practice in Python packages for convenience.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads all modules and objects from the current package.",
  "sinks": "The import statement itself does not directly lead to data leaks or security effects; however, it could indirectly involve dynamic or malicious modules if the package contents are malicious.",
  "flows": "No specific data flows are evident in this snippet, as it only performs a wildcard import.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from . import *' can obscure which modules or objects are imported, potentially hiding malicious modules or unintended code execution. The line itself is minimal, but its impact depends on the package contents.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import statement from the current package. This pattern is sometimes used for convenience but can be risky if the package contains malicious or untrusted modules. Since the code does not specify what is imported, it is impossible to assess the contents or identify malicious behavior directly. The lack of further code limits the ability to identify specific flows, sinks, or anomalies. Overall, the snippet alone does not indicate malicious behavior but warrants caution depending on the package's trustworthiness.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code performs a wildcard import from the current package, which by itself does not indicate malicious intent but can conceal malicious modules if present. The security risk depends on the contents of the package. No immediate malicious behavior or data leaks are evident from this snippet alone.",
