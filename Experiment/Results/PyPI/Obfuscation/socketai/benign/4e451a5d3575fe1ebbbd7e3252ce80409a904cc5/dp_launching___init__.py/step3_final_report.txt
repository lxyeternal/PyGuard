  "purpose": "Minimal Python module import statement, likely intended to import all symbols from the current package.",
  "sources": "The relative import from the current package/module (`from . import *`).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are observable in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure namespace and potentially hide malicious modules if present; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no embedded malicious behavior. The primary concern with such imports is namespace pollution and potential concealment of malicious modules, but the snippet itself is benign. No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities is present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0) are appropriate. The security risk score (around 0.2) reflects the potential risks of namespace pollution but not actual malicious activity. Confidence levels vary but are generally moderate to high, consistent with the minimal context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation; the main risk lies in the potential for hidden malicious modules within the package, which cannot be confirmed from this snippet alone. The assigned scores are appropriate, with minimal threat indicated.",
