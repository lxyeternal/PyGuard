{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the current package/module, potentially to expose all internal components for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statement at the beginning of the code, which pulls in all definitions from the current package/module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; it only performs an import operation.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this code only imports content without data flow beyond the import process.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a relative import with '*' can obscure which components are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code from initial review. No other code is present, making it impossible to analyze further behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement that imports all symbols from the current package/module. This practice can hide malicious or unintended behavior within the imported components, especially if the package contains malicious code. Since no other code is provided, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. The import statement itself is not malicious but can be risky if the imported module is malicious or contains malicious components. The lack of additional code or context limits the ability to evaluate behavior beyond the import statement itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet performs a standard import, but the use of 'from . import *' can be dangerous if the imported module is malicious or poorly maintained. No direct malicious activity is evident, but this pattern can hide malicious code in the imported module, warranting caution.",
