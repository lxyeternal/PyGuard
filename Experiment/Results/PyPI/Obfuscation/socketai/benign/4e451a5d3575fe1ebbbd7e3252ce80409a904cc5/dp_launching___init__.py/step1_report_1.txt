{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import all definitions from a local module or package within the current package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module/package in the same directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present; the statement itself does not process data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there is no data processing, only an import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from . import *' can lead to unclear namespace and potential hidden imports, but it is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement which imports all contents from a local module. This practice can obscure which parts of the code are imported and may hide malicious or unintended code if the imported module contains malicious content. However, the statement alone does not execute code or perform any malicious actions. No additional context or code is provided to determine malicious intent. It is a common pattern in Python packages, though not recommended for clarity.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The code is minimal and does not perform any harmful actions. The primary concern is the lack of explicit namespace management, but no malicious activity is evident.",
