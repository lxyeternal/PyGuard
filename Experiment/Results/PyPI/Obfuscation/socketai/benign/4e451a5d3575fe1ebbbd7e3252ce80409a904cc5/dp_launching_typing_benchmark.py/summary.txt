  "conclusion": "The code is a set of intentionally obfuscated data container classes with schema management methods. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation seems to be a tactic to hide simplicity, not to conceal malicious behavior. The security risk is low, and the malware score is correctly set to 0."
