  "purpose": "Defines multiple data models and utility functions for managing and generating reports related to metrics, docking, and visualization components.",
  "sources": "Input data from JSON files, user-provided output directories, and glob patterns for file matching.",
  "sinks": "Reading JSON files and writing reports to output files; no untrusted data directly flows into system or network operations.",
  "flows": "File reading operations (json.load) from specified paths, data serialization with self.json(), and report writing to files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic class methods, and conditional import with obscure module names. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly sets up data models using pydantic, includes a dynamic method for glob pattern matching, and a report saving function. The import obfuscation and naming conventions are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent. No external network connections, data exfiltration, or system manipulations are present. The code structure appears focused on data handling and report generation. The dynamic import and obfuscated method names might be suspicious but seem to serve a non-malicious purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data modeling and report management script with unusual naming and import patterns that could be obfuscation but are not inherently malicious. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior detected. Security risks are minimal, primarily related to unclear naming conventions.",
