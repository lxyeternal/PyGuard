{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple data models and utility functions for generating and handling visualizations and reports related to molecular docking and metrics.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries, third-party libraries (pydantic, wcmatch), and dynamic import based on a condition; reading JSON files in class methods.",
  "sinks": "Reading JSON files in class method 'XSwGuhgnzAjydPulnYlvHmsPlUPomXYg' and writing report files in 'boGdCYrAKLsPIoDPqiIhTzkfiAmnnQks'. No network or system command execution observed.",
  "flows": "File reading occurs when loading JSON data to instantiate objects; file writing occurs when exporting report data to disk.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import alias names (e.g., 'rhbCskKHfBNlsfUQXMDaUzkByJRkLEpF') and class names that appear randomly generated. The code uses dynamic import with conditional logic, but no malicious side effects are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data models using pydantic for structured data handling, with functions for exporting and importing JSON reports. The only potentially risky activity is file I/O, which is standard. No code injection, network activity, or system commands are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic identified. The obfuscated naming suggests code obfuscation but not malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate purposes related to data visualization and report generation without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for modeling, exporting, and importing visualization and report data. No malicious behavior or malware is evident. The obfuscated variable names suggest code obfuscation, but this alone is not malicious. Overall security risk is low.",
