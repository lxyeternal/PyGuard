{
  "purpose": "Defines data models and utility functions for report configuration, visualization, and serialization/deserialization of report data.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files, glob patterns, and external file paths for report data and configuration.",
  "sinks": "Reads JSON files, writes JSON reports, and serializes report objects to disk.",
  "flows": "Source data (JSON files, glob patterns) flows into data models, which are then serialized or deserialized; no network or system commands involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, conditional import from obscure modules, dynamic globbing, and conditional class methods; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles data modeling, report configuration, and file I/O operations. Obfuscated naming suggests an attempt to conceal details but does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration observed. The use of dynamic globbing and file operations is typical for report utilities. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious, and the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign report configuration and serialization utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation may serve to conceal internal details but does not pose a security threat.",
