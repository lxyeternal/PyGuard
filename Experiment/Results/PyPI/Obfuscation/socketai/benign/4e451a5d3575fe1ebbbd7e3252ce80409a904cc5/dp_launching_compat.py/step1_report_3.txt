  "purpose": "The code retrieves the version of the pydantic library and checks if it starts with '2.'",
  "sources": "Importing P_VERSION from pydantic.version",
  "sinks": "The startswith check on the version string",
  "flows": "Retrieving version info -> Checking version prefix",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code; variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a well-known library (pydantic). It assigns this version to a variable with an obfuscated name, then checks whether the version string begins with '2.', which could be part of a feature toggle or environment check. The obfuscated variable names may be intended to evade casual review but do not perform any malicious actions or data exfiltration. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no network calls, no file operations, or suspicious code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version check with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a compatibility or feature detection process. No malicious intent is evident.",
