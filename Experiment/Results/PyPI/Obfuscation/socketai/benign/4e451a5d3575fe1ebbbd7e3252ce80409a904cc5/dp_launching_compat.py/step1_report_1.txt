  "sinks": "The variable checking the version string for a specific prefix",
  "flows": "Import from pydantic.version -> Variable assignment -> String method call to check prefix",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names that do not describe purpose; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no network calls or system modifications",
  "analysis": "The code imports the VERSION attribute from pydantic.version, assigns it to an obfuscated variable name, then assigns a boolean indicating whether the version string starts with '2.' to another obfuscated variable. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external data handling, no system modification, and no malicious code behavior detected. The code appears to be a simple version check, potentially for compatibility purposes, but the variable names suggest obfuscation or attempt to hide intent. Overall, the code does not perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward version check with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
