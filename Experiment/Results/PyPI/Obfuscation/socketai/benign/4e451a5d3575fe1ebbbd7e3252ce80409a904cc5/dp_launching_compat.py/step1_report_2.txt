  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no clear reason for variable name complexity; no external input or output; simple version check",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from the pydantic library, assigns it to a variable with an obfuscated name, then checks if this version string starts with '2.'. The purpose appears to be identifying if pydantic is version 2.x. The obfuscated variable names do not serve a functional purpose and might suggest an attempt to hide intent. There are no external inputs, network communications, or suspicious behaviors. The logic is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign check on the installed pydantic version, using obfuscated variable names without malicious intent. No malicious behavior or security risks are present.",
