  "purpose": "Check if the pydantic version starts with '2.' to determine compatibility or feature support.",
  "sources": "Imports from pydantic.version, assigns to obfuscated variables, performs a string start check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, no network activity, no system modifications.",
  "flows": "Import -> assign to obfuscated variable -> check string start ('2.')",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple version check, assigning the version string to obfuscated variables and verifying if it starts with '2.'. No external inputs, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning a malware score of 0, low security risk (~0.1), and moderate obfuscation scores (~0.4-0.8). The high confidence scores (~0.9) are justified. No evidence suggests malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version check with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is likely stylistic rather than malicious. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0.4-0.8, security risk=0.1 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
