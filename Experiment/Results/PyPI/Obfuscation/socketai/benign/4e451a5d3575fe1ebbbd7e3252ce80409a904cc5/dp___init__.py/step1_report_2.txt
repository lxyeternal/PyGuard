  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for package distribution and management.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Import pkg_resources to declare namespace, fallback to pkgutil.extend_path if ImportError occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and exception handling for namespace declaration; no suspicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare the current package as a namespace using pkg_resources. If that module is unavailable, it falls back to using pkgutil to extend the package's __path__. Both modules are standard in Python packaging. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution. The code appears to be standard namespace package boilerplate, with no obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is standard namespace package boilerplate for Python distribution. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior. The code simply ensures the package can function as a namespace package across different environments.",
