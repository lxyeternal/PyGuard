  "purpose": "Namespace package declaration using conditional imports of 'pkg_resources' and 'pkgutil'.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'pkg_resources' and 'pkgutil', and the __import__ calls.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> declaration or extension of namespace -> no data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard boilerplate code with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package by importing 'pkg_resources' and calling 'declare_namespace(__name__)'. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to extending '__path__' with 'pkgutil.extend_path'. Both are common practices in Python packaging for namespace support. The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows well-established patterns without any obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are present. The code does not handle untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain hidden code. The logic is clear and standard, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package boilerplate with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It is safe, well-understood, and poses no security risks.",
