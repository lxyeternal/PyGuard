  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for Python distribution, allowing multiple packages to share the same namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements (__import__ functions) and __path__ extension",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data output or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "Importing modules and extending __path__ for namespace packages",
  "anomalies": "Standard namespace declaration pattern; no suspicious or unusual behavior observed; no hardcoded secrets or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using pkg_resources, falling back to pkgutil if ImportError occurs. This pattern is common for defining namespace packages. It involves importing modules and modifying the __path__ variable to include additional paths for package sharing. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The code is minimal, straightforward, and follows conventional practices for namespace declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation for namespace packages and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and used to support package modularity.",
