{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up namespace package declarations for a Python package, enabling it to be split across multiple distributions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the __name__ variable, attempts to import 'pkg_resources' to declare a namespace, and falls back to importing 'pkgutil' if 'pkg_resources' is not available.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any data sinks that could lead to data leaks or security issues. It mainly modifies package namespace configuration.",
  "flows": "The code imports a module based on a conditional and then uses functions to declare or extend namespace paths. No untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to perform standard namespace setup for Python packages using known techniques. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to declare a namespace for a package using 'pkg_resources'. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to using 'pkgutil' to extend the package path. Both are common methods for namespace package management. The code does not execute any untrusted code, send data over networks, or include obfuscated logic. Its structure and logic are typical for package namespace handling, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard namespace package setup without any malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical pattern used in Python packaging systems.",
