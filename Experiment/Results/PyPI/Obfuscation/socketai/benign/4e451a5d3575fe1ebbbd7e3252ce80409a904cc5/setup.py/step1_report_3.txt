  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'dp-launching-app'.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from the import statements, string literals, and the setup() function parameters.",
  "sinks": "None identified that could lead to data leaks or security issues directly; no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the setup process appears standard.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual base64-like string 'AfqRXgPlcZkJpmtdfNVhGJuqdsvdUtSd=' used as 'long_description' which could be obfuscated or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a typical package setup using setuptools, specifying package info and dependencies. The 'long_description' contains a base64-like string, which is unusual and warrants further investigation. All dependencies appear standard and benign. No code injection, network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident. The import statement is standard, and the setup() call is straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, environment variables, or dynamic code execution are present. The suspicious string might be obfuscated or a placeholder, but in isolation, it does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with an unusual string in 'long_description'. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The string's purpose is unclear but not inherently malicious based on this snippet alone.",
