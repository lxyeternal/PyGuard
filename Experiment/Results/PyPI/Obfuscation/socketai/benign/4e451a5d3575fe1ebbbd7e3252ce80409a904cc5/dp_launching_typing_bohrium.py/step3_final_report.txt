{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes for validation, normalization, and encoding of various Bohrium-related identifiers and resource types, primarily for internal data handling within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Reads input data via class methods, including untrusted data types such as strings, bytes, bytearrays, and memoryviews.",
  "sinks": "Encodes data into base64 format, updates schema dictionaries with specific formats, and yields class instances; no external system calls or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through type validation, possibly base64 encoding, and into class instances or schema updates.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or autogenerated class names and some unusual naming conventions; extensive base64 encoding of untrusted data, but no malicious payloads or external communications.",
  "analysis": "The code performs data validation and normalization for identifiers and resource types, with encoding routines that are standard for data serialization. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscated naming appears stylistic or autogenerated rather than malicious. The code's behavior is consistent with benign data handling modules, and no security vulnerabilities or malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign data classes used for validation and encoding within a larger system. There is no evidence of malware, malicious backdoors, or harmful behavior. Obfuscation appears stylistic or autogenerated, not malicious. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal.",
