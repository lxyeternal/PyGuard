  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as performing multiple relative imports using wildcard syntax from local modules.\n- No external network activity, data handling, or code execution is visible.\n- Wildcard imports (*) are used, which can lead to namespace pollution and obscure the origin of imported symbols.\n- The code appears to be a typical package initialization pattern, likely in an `__init__.py` file.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues in the Code:\n- The code only contains import statements; no malicious code, external communication, or data flow is present.\n- The use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged because it can cause namespace conflicts and obscure code origin, but it is not inherently malicious.\n\n### Logical and Reasoning Flaws:\n- The reports correctly identify that wildcard imports can be risky from a maintainability perspective but do not indicate malicious intent.\n- Some reports suggest potential maliciousness due to obscurity, but without evidence, this is speculative.\n- No assumptions about malicious behavior are justified solely based on these import statements.\n\n### Score Evaluations:\n- **Confidence:** Generally high (0.7–0.9), which is reasonable given the simplicity of the code.\n- **Obfuscated:** Correctly set to 0, as the code is straightforward, albeit using wildcard imports.\n- **Malware:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Security Risk:** Low (0.1–0.2), which is appropriate given the lack of malicious behavior but acknowledging that wildcard imports can cause maintainability issues.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes needed unless further context reveals malicious modules or code within the imported modules.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (not obfuscated; straightforward import statements)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1–0.2 (low, mainly due to wildcard import practices)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minor maintainability concern but no security risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports correctly identify that this code snippet is a standard package import pattern with no malicious intent. The use of wildcard imports is a concern for code clarity but not a security threat. The assigned scores are appropriate and should remain as is unless additional context indicates otherwise.",
