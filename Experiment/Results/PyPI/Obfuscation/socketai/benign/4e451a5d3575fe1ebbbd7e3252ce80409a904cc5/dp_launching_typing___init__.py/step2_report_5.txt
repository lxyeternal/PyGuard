  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same pattern: multiple relative imports using wildcard syntax from local modules.\n- No external data, network activity, or code execution is visible.\n- The main concern raised is the use of wildcard imports (*), which can cause namespace pollution and potentially hide malicious code if present within the imported modules.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity detected directly in this snippet.\n- Security risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), which aligns with the benign nature of import statements.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code is straightforward and does **not** contain any malware, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior in itself.\n- The use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged because it can obscure what is imported and potentially mask malicious code within the modules, but it is not malicious by itself.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports uniformly suggest that the code is benign, which is accurate given only the import statements.\n- They do not consider that the imported modules themselves could contain malicious code. However, since the focus is on this code snippet, that is acceptable.\n- The reasoning is consistent; no false positives or unwarranted concerns are apparent.\n\n### Scores evaluation:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), which seems reasonable.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.8-0.9), justified by the simplicity of the code.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.2, which is appropriate.\n- Since the code is just import statements, a risk score above 0.5 would be unjustified unless there is evidence of malicious content within the imported modules.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- The malware score remains 0 across all reports, which is correct based solely on this snippet.\n- If the imported modules are malicious, that would not be reflected here unless the analysis extended into those modules.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume that wildcard imports are not malicious; this is reasonable.\n- They do not assume malicious intent solely based on import statements, which is correct.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: minimal risk, no malware, and standard import pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1-0.2 (appropriate given the context)\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, mainly due to wildcard imports which can cause maintainability issues but are not malicious)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is benign, with the main concern being the use of wildcard imports, which could be problematic for maintainability but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n**Final recommendation:** Keep the malware score at 0, obfuscated at 0, and assign a low risk score (~0.1-0.2). No changes needed unless additional context about the imported modules indicates otherwise.",
