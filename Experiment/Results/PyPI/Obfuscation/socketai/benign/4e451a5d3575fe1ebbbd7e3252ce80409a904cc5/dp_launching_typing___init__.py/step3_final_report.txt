  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .basic, .benchmark, .bio, .bohrium, .dflow, .io",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external network or data flow present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; purely import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) which can cause namespace pollution and obscure symbol origins, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of multiple relative import statements using wildcard syntax, typical in __init__.py files for package aggregation. No external data, network activity, or code execution is evident. Wildcard imports are discouraged for maintainability but do not constitute malicious behavior. The imported modules' contents are unknown, so potential malicious code could reside within them, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscated to 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the benign nature of import statements with minor maintainability concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing standard package initialization with wildcard imports. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The low security risk score is justified, and the malware score remains at 0. No changes are necessary.",
