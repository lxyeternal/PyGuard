The obfuscated naming does not impact functionality but warrants caution. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is detected. The footnote content is managed internally, and the creation of HTML elements with data attributes is typical for such extensions. The pattern matching and element creation are straightforward and do not pose security risks. The obfuscation may be stylistic or for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code is a benign Markdown extension for footnotes with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious behavior, external system interaction, or security vulnerabilities is present. The high obfuscation score reflects naming complexity but not malicious intent. The overall security risk is low. The malware score is zero, and the code appears safe for use in standard environments.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.6,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
