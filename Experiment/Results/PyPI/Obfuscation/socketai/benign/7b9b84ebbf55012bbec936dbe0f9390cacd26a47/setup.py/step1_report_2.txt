  "purpose": "To define the setup configuration for a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; standard setup invocation.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sensitive data exposure.",
  "flows": "N/A, as the code does not process or transfer data.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any unusual code or hidden behaviors. The code is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' library and calls 'setuptools.setup()' with default parameters. This is a typical pattern for Python package setup scripts. No suspicious activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscated or malicious code present. The script solely initiates package configuration using default settings.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard minimal setup script for Python packages with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
