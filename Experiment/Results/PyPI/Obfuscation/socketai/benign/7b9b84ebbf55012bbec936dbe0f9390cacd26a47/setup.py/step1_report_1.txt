  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package using setuptools",
  "sources": "setuptools.setup() call (which may read package metadata and configuration)",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; the setup function primarily processes package configuration",
  "flows": "N/A (no untrusted data flow identified)",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no anomalies or suspicious patterns present",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and invokes the setup() function with no arguments. This is a standard package setup script that is typically used to configure package distribution. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs. The script does not include any dynamic code execution or external data access beyond standard setup processing.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security issues detected. It appears to be a typical minimal package configuration file.",
