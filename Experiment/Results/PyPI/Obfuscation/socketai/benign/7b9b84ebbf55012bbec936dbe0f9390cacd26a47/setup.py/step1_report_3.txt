  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths in this minimal setup.",
  "anomalies": "The code is extremely minimal and standard for a setup script; no unusual or suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and calls its setup() function with default parameters. This is typical for Python packaging and does not contain any malicious logic, data handling, or security concerns. There are no hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or network activity. Given its simplicity, it appears to be a benign setup script with no signs of obfuscation or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python package setup script with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It poses no security risks.",
