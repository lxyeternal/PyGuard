  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, anomalies, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Any code reading untrusted input, environment variables, network or system commands, or handling sensitive data.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, file operations, environment variables, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as untrusted input or environment variables to sinks like network transmission or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, unusual code patterns, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are minimal or absent, limiting definitive assessment. All reports correctly identify the lack of suspicious patterns, malicious code, or obfuscation. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of evidence. Security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting cautious suspicion due to limited context but no concrete issues. Confidence levels are moderate, appropriate given the limited code visibility. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The reasoning across reports is consistent and cautious, avoiding false positives.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited information, the code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The current scores (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the assessments. No adjustments are necessary.",
