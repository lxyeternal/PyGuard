      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact security. The overall security risk is minimal. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.7, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with this assessment."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The dependency contains code with significant obfuscation and dynamic execution features, indicating a high potential for malicious behavior. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the signs warrant a high malware score (~0.75) and overall security risk (~0.7). Benign reports are correctly scored near zero. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for confirmation, but current scores are appropriate given the evidence."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "This is a plugin management wrapper with no evident malicious activity. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external plugins and loader modules. Obfuscation and dynamic loading introduce potential risks if sources are compromised, but no direct malicious behavior is observed. Continuous validation and integrity checks are recommended."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code snippets do not exhibit confirmed malicious behavior. The potential for exploitation exists in dynamic execution points, but no active malicious activity is present. Malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is moderate (~0.2–0.45), reflecting cautious assessment of dynamic features. The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses and the observed code behaviors."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The package contains moderate obfuscation and suspicious dynamic code execution, warranting cautious handling. While no definitive malware is confirmed, the high obfuscation and eval/exec usage justify a malware score of approximately 0.4 and a security risk of about 0.4. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, if obfuscated, static analysis plugin for suppression comment handling. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and complex suppression logic, but the code itself is benign."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate monitoring plugin with significant obfuscation. No signs of malicious behavior or active threats are detected. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but overall, the code's purpose seems benign. Continuous monitoring and source verification are recommended if deployed in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated plugin primarily used for code region analysis and metrics validation. There are no signs of malicious activity, but the heavy obfuscation warrants cautious review. The overall security risk is low, with a malware likelihood close to zero, but the obfuscation score remains high due to naming and control flow complexity."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated data analysis and reporting tool, likely used for metrics or security analysis. Despite the obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and risk scores should remain low. The overall assessment indicates a low threat level, with the obfuscation being the primary concern for further review."
