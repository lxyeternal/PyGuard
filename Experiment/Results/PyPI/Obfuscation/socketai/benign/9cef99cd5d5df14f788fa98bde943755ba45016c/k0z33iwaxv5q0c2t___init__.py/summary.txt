  "confidence": 0.85,
  "conclusion": "The dependency contains code with significant obfuscation and dynamic execution features, indicating a high potential for malicious behavior. While no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed, the signs warrant a high malware score (~0.75) and overall security risk (~0.7). Benign reports are correctly scored near zero. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended for confirmation, but current scores are appropriate given the evidence."
