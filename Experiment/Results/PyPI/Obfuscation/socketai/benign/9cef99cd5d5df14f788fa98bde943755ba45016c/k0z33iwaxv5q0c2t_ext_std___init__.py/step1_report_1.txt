{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, and potentially external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in subprocess calls, which could lead to data leaks or unintended execution.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from sources such as input prompts or environment variables to sinks like network sockets or file writes, passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic evaluation, or unconventional variable names suggest possible obfuscation. Hardcoded credentials or URLs are absent but should be verified explicitly.",
  "analysis": "Initial code inspection shows standard imports and function definitions. No evident malicious functions such as network connections to suspicious domains, or system command executions with unsanitized inputs. Some dynamic code execution or obfuscated constructs, if present, should be closely examined for hidden malicious behavior. The code does not contain obvious malware signatures such as data exfiltration or backdoors. However, without executing or further analyzing the runtime behavior, absolute certainty cannot be achieved.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not display clear malicious intent based on static analysis; however, potential obfuscation or hidden logic warrants cautious review. No immediate security risks or malware indicators detected.",
