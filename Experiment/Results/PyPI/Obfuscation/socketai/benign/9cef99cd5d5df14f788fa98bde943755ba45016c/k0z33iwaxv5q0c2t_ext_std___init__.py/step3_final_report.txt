  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python package for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Dynamic code execution functions (eval, exec), environment variables, network addresses, input functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, environment variables, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as eval/exec and input functions lead to sinks like network and file operations, indicating potential malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, high obfuscation scores, suspicious network addresses, misleading variable names, and dynamic code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are common indicators of malicious intent. Report 3 notably highlights eval/exec usage and network activity, justifying high malware (0.6) and obfuscation (0.8) scores. Other reports show minimal or no suspicious activity, with low scores. The overall pattern suggests moderate risk primarily driven by the suspicious traits in Report 3. The confidence in these findings is high due to explicit indicators, but static analysis alone cannot confirm malicious payloads without runtime testing.",
  "conclusion": "The package contains moderate obfuscation and suspicious dynamic code execution, warranting cautious handling. While no definitive malware is confirmed, the high obfuscation and eval/exec usage justify a malware score of approximately 0.4 and a security risk of about 0.4. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
