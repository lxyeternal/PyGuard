  "conclusion": "The package contains moderate obfuscation and suspicious dynamic code execution, warranting cautious handling. While no definitive malware is confirmed, the high obfuscation and eval/exec usage justify a malware score of approximately 0.4 and a security risk of about 0.4. Further dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm malicious intent."
