  "conclusion": "The code snippets do not exhibit confirmed malicious behavior. The potential for exploitation exists in dynamic execution points, but no active malicious activity is present. Malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is moderate (~0.2–0.45), reflecting cautious assessment of dynamic features. The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses and the observed code behaviors."
