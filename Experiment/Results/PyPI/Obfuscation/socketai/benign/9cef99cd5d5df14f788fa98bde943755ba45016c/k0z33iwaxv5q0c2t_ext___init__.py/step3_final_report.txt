  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, dynamic code execution (eval/exec), subprocess calls, input handling, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, data exfiltration channels.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) to dynamic execution or network sinks, potentially via subprocess or eval/exec.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec without validation, hardcoded or unvalidated environment variables, suspicious subprocess calls, incomplete code snippets with missing context.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets primarily perform routine data processing or environment variable access. Some snippets involve dynamic code execution (eval/exec) and subprocess calls, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. The use of unvalidated inputs poses moderate security risks, but without confirmed malicious activity, scores remain low. Obfuscation is not detected. Confidence levels vary based on completeness of code; overall, assessments are cautious and aligned with observed behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets do not exhibit confirmed malicious behavior. The potential for exploitation exists in dynamic execution points, but no active malicious activity is present. Malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and security risk is moderate (~0.2–0.45), reflecting cautious assessment of dynamic features. The reports' scores are consistent with their analyses and the observed code behaviors.",
