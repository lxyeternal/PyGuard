  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply executes a setup process with no data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for packaging; no anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' module and calls 'setup()' with default parameters. It is a typical minimal setup script for packaging Python projects. It does not perform any data processing, network activity, or sensitive operations. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected. The code is straightforward and standard for Python packaging.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
