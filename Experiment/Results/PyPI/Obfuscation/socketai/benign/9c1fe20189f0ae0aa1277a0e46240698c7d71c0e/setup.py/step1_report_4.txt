  "purpose": "Basic setup script for packaging a Python project using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading; uses imported setup function from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code simply invokes setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code structure; no hardcoded credentials, no unusual code patterns, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools and calls it with default arguments. It is a minimal and standard packaging script, with no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The simplicity reduces risk and indicates typical usage for package distribution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, standard setup script for packaging Python modules. No malicious intent, no suspicious code detected.",
