  "purpose": "Assessment of supply chain security risks in the analyzed Python package code.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external modules, hardcoded strings, user input, network/system functions, dynamic execution points like eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network communication functions, file I/O, system commands, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network/system functions or dynamic execution points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, hardcoded credentials or API keys, obfuscated variable names, convoluted code structures, suspicious data flows to network/system functions.",
  "analysis": "Benign reports (1-4) show no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity, with scores reflecting low threat levels and high confidence. The high-confidence benign assessments are consistent with the absence of anomalies. Report 5 indicates multiple suspicious behaviors, including dynamic execution and hardcoded secrets, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.6), and security risk (0.8) scores. These scores align with the described malicious indicators, and no adjustments are necessary unless code specifics contradict these findings.",
  "conclusion": "The scores in reports 1-4 are appropriate given their benign nature. Report 5's high scores are justified by the suspicious behaviors described. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the evidence, and no revisions are needed.",
