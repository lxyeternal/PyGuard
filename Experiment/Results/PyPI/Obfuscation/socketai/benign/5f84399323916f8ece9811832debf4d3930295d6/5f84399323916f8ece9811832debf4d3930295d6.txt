      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign or low-risk, with some suspicion around dynamic execution and network activity that warrants monitoring. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments could be made if explicit evidence of malicious functions ('eval', 'exec') is found. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on current information, but vigilance is advised for code with potential dynamic behaviors."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated MkDocs plugin focused on navigation and content management. Despite the heavy obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk remains low. The obfuscation score is high but justified by the naming style, and the overall risk is minimal."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing straightforward string and pattern processing with superficial obfuscation. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation does not currently conceal malicious intent, and the code's purpose appears to be documentation or filename manipulation. The security risk is low, and no action is necessary."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign recursive data flattening utility with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, external communication, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely intentional but does not indicate malicious intent. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis."
