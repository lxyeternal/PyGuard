  "conclusion": "The majority of the code appears benign or low-risk, with some suspicion around dynamic execution and network activity that warrants monitoring. Scores are generally appropriate; minor adjustments could be made if explicit evidence of malicious functions ('eval', 'exec') is found. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on current information, but vigilance is advised for code with potential dynamic behaviors."
