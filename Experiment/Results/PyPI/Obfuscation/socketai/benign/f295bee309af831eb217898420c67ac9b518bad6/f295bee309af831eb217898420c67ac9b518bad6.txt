      "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing native dependencies in a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity. The main concern is external file and environment trustworthiness, which could be exploited in supply chain attacks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is low (~0.2), and the security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3), justified by external dependency trust issues but no active malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. There is no malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. The obfuscation is superficial and not indicative of malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or escalation is necessary."
