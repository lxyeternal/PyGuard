{
  "purpose": "Load native libraries required for the 'pyembree' package, depending on Python version and environment.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.environ.get, open() reading from a file, importlib.metadata.version",
  "sinks": "os.add_dll_directory, WinDLL calls, environment variable modifications",
  "flows": "Source of environment variables and file contents leading to DLL loading via add_dll_directory and WinDLL",
  "anomalies": "Dynamic DLL loading based on environment and file contents; use of environment variables to modify DLL search behavior; reading a load order file and loading DLLs accordingly.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages the loading of native libraries for 'pyembree' in a version- and environment-specific manner. It adjusts environment variables and loads DLLs dynamically, which is standard for native library setup but can be risky if the load order file or environment variables are tampered with. The load order file is read from disk and each DLL specified is loaded via WinDLL, which could be exploited if an attacker influences the file or environment. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obvious malicious code are present. The use of environment variable modifications and dynamic DLL loading are points that warrant review but are not inherently malicious. No network activity, data leakage, or code injection is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intended for standard library loading procedures for 'pyembree' with environment-specific handling. It does not exhibit signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware. The only concern is reliance on external files and environment variables for DLL loading, which could be exploited if compromised, but this is typical for native library management.",
