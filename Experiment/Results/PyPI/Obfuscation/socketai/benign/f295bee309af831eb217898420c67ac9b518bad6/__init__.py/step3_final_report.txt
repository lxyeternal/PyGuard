{
  "purpose": "Load native libraries for the 'pyembree' package, handling different Python versions and environment configurations, including DLL loading and environment variable adjustments.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.environ.get, os.environ.pop, os.add_dll_directory, open(load order file), importlib.metadata.version",
  "sinks": "DLL loading via WinDLL or os.add_dll_directory, environment variable modifications",
  "flows": "Environment variables influence DLL search paths; load order file specifies DLLs to load; DLLs are loaded dynamically based on these sources",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic DLL loading without explicit validation; environment variable manipulation; reading load order file; variable names obfuscated",
  "analysis": "The code loads native DLLs for 'pyembree' with platform and version-specific logic, manipulating environment variables and reading a load order file to load DLLs dynamically. It retrieves package version info via importlib.metadata. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are present. The environment variable modifications and DLL loading are standard but could be exploited if external files or environment variables are compromised. The obfuscation is minimal, primarily in variable naming. Risks are associated with DLL hijacking or tampering, but no active malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing native dependencies in a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity. The main concern is external file and environment trustworthiness, which could be exploited in supply chain attacks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is low (~0.2), and the security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3), justified by external dependency trust issues but no active malicious intent.",
