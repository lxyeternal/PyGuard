  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for managing native dependencies in a Python package, with no signs of malicious activity. The main concern is external file and environment trustworthiness, which could be exploited in supply chain attacks. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is low (~0.2), and the security risk is moderate (~0.2-0.3), justified by external dependency trust issues but no active malicious intent."
