{
  "purpose": "The code loads a native library related to 'pyembree' depending on the Python version, either by adjusting DLL search paths or loading DLLs directly from a specified directory, and retrieves the 'pyembree' package version.",
  "sources": "os.path.abspath, os.environ, sys.version_info, os.path.exists, open() for reading the '.load-order-pyembree-0.2.11' file, importlib.metadata.version",
  "sinks": "os.add_dll_directory, WinDLL(os.path.join(...)), os.environ modifications, reading the '.load-order-pyembree-0.2.11' file",
  "flows": "Environment variables and DLL search paths influence dynamic library loading, reading DLL load order from file influences DLL loading, package version retrieval",
  "anomalies": "Conditional DLL directory addition based on Python version, dynamic DLL loading with WinDLL, manipulation of environment variables, reading load order from a file named '.load-order-pyembree-0.2.11' in a specific directory",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically adjusts DLL loading paths depending on Python version, using os.add_dll_directory for newer versions, or manually loading DLLs listed in a load order file for older versions. It modifies environment variables temporarily for specific Python versions, potentially to influence DLL search behavior. The code retrieves the 'pyembree' package version via importlib.metadata. All actions involve standard library functions and are focused on loading native libraries needed by the 'pyembree' package, with no evident obfuscation or suspicious behavior. There are no hardcoded credentials, network activity, or data exfiltration. The dynamic DLL loading appears to be standard for ensuring compatibility across environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily concerned with environment-specific native library loading for the 'pyembree' package, using standard Python techniques without any signs of malicious behavior. There are no indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. It performs expected setup for native dependencies based on system configuration.",
