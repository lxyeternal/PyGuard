  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; simple assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated-looking variable name; no apparent malicious code or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a static string '0.2.11' to a variable with an intentionally obscure name. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The variable name appears obfuscated but does not, in itself, indicate malicious intent. No suspicious patterns or behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
