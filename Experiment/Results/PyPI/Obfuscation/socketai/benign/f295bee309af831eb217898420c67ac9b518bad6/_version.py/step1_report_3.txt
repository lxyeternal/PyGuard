{
  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely indicating a package version.",
  "sources": "The code reads a string literal assigned to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only contains a variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears as a random string, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '0.2.11' to a variable named 'WCGBLvBXuDZThAYqMmYPDXreDoeVvnUL'. The variable name appears random and non-descriptive, which could be a sign of obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent. However, the assignment itself is straightforward and does not involve any malicious functions or data flows. There is no evidence of input reading, data leakage, or malicious behavior. The simplicity suggests no malicious intent or security risk.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple variable assignment of a version string with an obfuscated variable name. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues.",
