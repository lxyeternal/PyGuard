  "purpose": "Import modules related to Windows Runtime (WinRT) system and UI input core functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements loading modules 'winrt.system' and 'winrt._winrt_windows_ui_input_core.RadialControllerIndependentInputSource'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely imports modules and defines __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Limited to import statements with no additional logic; no anomalies detected. Usage of WinRT modules may be unusual in some contexts but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific WinRT modules related to system and UI input. The presence of 'RadialControllerIndependentInputSource' suggests interaction with Windows hardware features. No data processing, network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal and appears to set up for UI input handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import setup for Windows Runtime components, likely used in a larger application that interacts with hardware input devices. It shows no malicious behavior or security risks based on this snippet alone.",
