{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific modules related to Windows Runtime (WinRT) APIs, possibly for input device management or handling hardware input sources.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'winrt.system' and 'winrt._winrt_windows_ui_input_core', which load external WinRT modules and classes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points where untrusted data is processed or exported; the code mainly imports modules and defines an export list.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code does not process or manipulate input data, just imports modules and declares exports.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors. The code is minimal and straightforward, with standard WinRT API usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Windows Runtime modules related to system and UI input input sources. It exports a class 'RadialControllerIndependentInputSource'. There is no evidence of data handling, network activity, or suspicious logic. The imports are typical for Windows-specific applications that interact with hardware input devices. No obfuscated patterns or malicious constructs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module that imports specific Windows Runtime classes for UI input handling and exports them. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. It appears to be legitimate and safe, assuming the context of use is appropriate.",
