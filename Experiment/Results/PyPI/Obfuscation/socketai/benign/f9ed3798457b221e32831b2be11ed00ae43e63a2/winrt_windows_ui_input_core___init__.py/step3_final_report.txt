{
  "purpose": "Minimal import of Windows Runtime APIs related to UI input sources, likely part of a larger Windows application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'winrt' modules, specifically 'winrt.system' and 'winrt._winrt_windows_ui_input_core.RadialControllerIndependentInputSource'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or system modifications present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static; no data flows or untrusted data from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and contains only import declarations and an __all__ list.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple module that imports specific Windows Runtime components related to input sources and defines an export list. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution. The code's structure is clear, with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. Given the absence of data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscation, the code is benign. The minimal security risk stems from the fact that it involves system API imports, which are standard in Windows applications, but pose no inherent threat in this context. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and the security risk score is effectively 0, with a very conservative 0.1 in some assessments due to the context of system module usage. Overall, the code is safe and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import setup for Windows Runtime input source modules. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
