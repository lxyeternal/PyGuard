  "purpose": "Import statements from internal modules (.covidcast, .plotting, .geography) with obfuscated identifiers, likely for data handling and visualization.",
  "sources": "Internal modules (.covidcast, .plotting, .geography) with obfuscated function/variable names.",
  "sinks": "None; only static import statements, no data flows or external communications.",
  "flows": "No data flows; imports are static and do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of identifiers; no active malicious code or behaviors present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with nonsensical, obfuscated names. No data processing, network activity, or file operations are evident. The obfuscation could be benign (e.g., code protection) or malicious (concealing harmful code). Given the absence of active logic, data flows, or external interactions, there is no evidence of malicious intent. Malware scores are appropriately low or zero, and obfuscation scores are high due to identifier naming. The security risk remains minimal as no active threats are demonstrated.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is benign, consisting only of import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent; the malware scores should be adjusted to 0 where currently above zero, especially in report 5, which currently assigns 0.1. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, and no active malicious activity is evident.",
