  "purpose": "Defines a class inheriting from Warning, with a single class variable containing an obfuscated string.",
  "sources": "The class definition and the assignment to the class variable QkTSViidnkUaLtirfdxsJDoNmzRLZccx.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data is processed or transmitted to external sources within this snippet.",
  "flows": "The class declaration sets a static string; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and variable name appear obfuscated, and the string assigned looks like a random sequence, which may suggest obfuscation or hiding intent. No other code or context is provided.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from Warning, which is a built-in Python exception class, and assigns a seemingly random string to a class variable. The obfuscation might be benign or malicious; however, without further code, no malicious activity can be confirmed. The class itself does not perform any actions, data processing, or network operations. The presence of obfuscated identifiers may indicate an attempt to hide purpose or functionality, but with only this snippet, the intent remains unclear.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated but does not demonstrate any malicious behavior within this snippet. It is a simple class definition with a static string. No security risks or malware are evident from the provided code.",
