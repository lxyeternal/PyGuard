  "purpose": "Define a class inheriting from Warning with a class attribute containing an obfuscated string.",
  "sources": "Class definition and class attribute assignment.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class attribute assignment is static.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a class name that appears obfuscated or intentionally complex; no functions or methods present; string value stored may be obfuscated or malicious, but static assignment alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from Warning, which is a standard Python warning class. It includes a class attribute with a seemingly random string. There is no dynamic code execution, no input handling, and no external data sources. The string could be obfuscated or benign, but without further context, it appears to be a static data assignment. No suspicious behavior, external network activity, or malicious intent is evident from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple class definition with a static string attribute. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
