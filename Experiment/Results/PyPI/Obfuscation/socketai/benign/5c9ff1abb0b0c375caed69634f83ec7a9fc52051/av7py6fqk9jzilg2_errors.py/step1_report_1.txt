  "purpose": "Define a custom warning class with a class attribute containing a string value.",
  "sources": "The class attribute 'QkTSViidnkUaLtirfdxsJDoNmzRLZccx' initialized with a string.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; no input or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class and a string attribute.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated-looking class name and attribute name, but no active malicious behavior or code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from the 'Warning' class, which is standard in Python for custom warnings. It contains a class variable with an obfuscated name holding a string. There are no methods, no input/output operations, no network activity, and no code execution beyond class definition. The obfuscated naming might be for concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, input handling, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign class definition with obfuscated names, likely intended for custom warning handling. No malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
