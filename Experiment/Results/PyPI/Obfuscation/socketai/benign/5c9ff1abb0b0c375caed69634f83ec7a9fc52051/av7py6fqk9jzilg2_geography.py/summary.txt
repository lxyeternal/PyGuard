  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geographic data lookup utility with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation appears cosmetic or for code minimization, not malicious. Security risks are minimal, and malware scores are zero. The supply chain is considered safe, and no further security measures are necessary beyond standard review."
