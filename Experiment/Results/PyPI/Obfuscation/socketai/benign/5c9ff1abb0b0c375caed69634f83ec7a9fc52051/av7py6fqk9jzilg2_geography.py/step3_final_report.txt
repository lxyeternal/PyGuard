{
  "purpose": "The code performs geographic data lookups using CSV files loaded from package resources, providing functions to retrieve geographic identifiers and names based on input codes or names.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files from package resources containing county, MSA, and state census data; functions accept input codes or names for lookup.",
  "sinks": "No external data transmission, network activity, or file writing; internal data processing only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (codes/names) are matched via regex or direct comparison against CSV data, returning matched geographic identifiers or names.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are obfuscated or nonsensical, likely due to code minification or obfuscation, but no malicious patterns or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code loads static CSV data and provides lookup functions with regex matching options. No network, system modifications, or data exfiltration are observed. The obfuscated variable names do not correlate with malicious behavior but suggest code obfuscation. The functions perform straightforward data filtering and matching, with warnings for ambiguous matches. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are detected. The overall behavior aligns with a benign geographic data utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard geographic data lookup utility with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation appears cosmetic or for code minimization, not malicious. Security risks are minimal, and malware scores are zero. The supply chain is considered safe, and no further security measures are necessary beyond standard review.",
