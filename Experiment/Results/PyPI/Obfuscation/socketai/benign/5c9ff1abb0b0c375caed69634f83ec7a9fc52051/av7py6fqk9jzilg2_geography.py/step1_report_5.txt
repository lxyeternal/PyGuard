{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide functions for mapping geographic identifiers (such as county, MSA, state) to their names or codes using CSV datasets. It facilitates geographic data lookups based on input codes or names.",
  "sources": "Reads CSV files from package resources: 'county_census.csv', 'msa_census.csv', and 'state_census.csv'. These files are accessed via pkg_resources.resource_filename, which indicates reading static data embedded within the package.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications. No output or data leakage mechanisms are apparent.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (codes or names) are processed through matching functions (mainly qcuXfmbMIdAiCFJEZQoZpmHIUvGsPGjr). These functions perform regex searches or direct matches against data columns from loaded CSVs, then produce lists of matched geographic identifiers or names.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code uses regex for matching but in a straightforward manner. No obfuscation or hidden behaviors detected. Warnings are only used for non-uniqueness in matches, which is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script loads geographic data from CSV files packaged within the module, then provides lookup functions to match geographic codes or names to corresponding identifiers or labels. These functions perform regex searches, handle case sensitivity, and manage multiple matches with options for 'first' or 'all'. The code is structured cleanly, with descriptive variable names (albeit obfuscated), and does not perform any data exfiltration, system modification, or network operations. The use of warnings for multiple matches is benign and typical for data lookup utilities. Overall, the code appears to be standard geographic data lookup functionality with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for geographic data lookups. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are present. The code functions as expected for a data mapping utility without hidden or harmful operations.",
