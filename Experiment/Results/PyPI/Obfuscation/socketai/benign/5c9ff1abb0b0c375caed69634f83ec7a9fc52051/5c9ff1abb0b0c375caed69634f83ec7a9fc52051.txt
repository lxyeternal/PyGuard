      "conclusion": "The code is a standard geographic data lookup utility with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation appears cosmetic or for code minimization, not malicious. Security risks are minimal, and malware scores are zero. The supply chain is considered safe, and no further security measures are necessary beyond standard review."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code fragment is benign, consisting only of import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports are consistent; the malware scores should be adjusted to 0 where currently above zero, especially in report 5, which currently assigns 0.1. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, and no active malicious activity is evident."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily for legitimate COVID-19 data collection and processing, with high obfuscation levels that could be used to hide malicious activity. No concrete evidence of malware or supply chain attacks is present. The malware score is low, and the overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation. Further static analysis is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static class with obfuscated names, posing no security threat or malicious intent. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious behavior but may be used for concealment. Scores should reflect zero malware and low security risk, with moderate obfuscation."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate geospatial visualization toolkit with significant obfuscation, likely for concealment rather than malicious purposes. No signs of malware or sabotage are evident based on the static analysis. The current malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk remains low (~0.2). Further dynamic analysis and inspection of external modules are recommended for complete certainty."
