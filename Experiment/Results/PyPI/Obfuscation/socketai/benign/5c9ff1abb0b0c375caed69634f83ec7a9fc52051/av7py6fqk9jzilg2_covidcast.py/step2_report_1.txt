  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, compare their findings, and assess the appropriateness of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on obfuscation (variable names, unnecessary imports), complex logic, and warnings of code concealment. No concrete malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.1, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.3, Confidence 0.6.\n- **Assessment:** Given the high obfuscation and some complexity, but no evidence of malicious behavior, these scores seem reasonable. The malware score is low, consistent with the absence of direct malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on obfuscation, dynamic variable names, deprecated functions, and API interactions. No signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.3, Confidence 0.7.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher malware score than Report 1, which is acceptable given the persistent obfuscation and deprecated warnings. The risk score remains low, aligning with the findings.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on standard data fetching and processing, with minimal obfuscation. No evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.0, Obfuscated 0.2, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The low obfuscation and zero malware score are consistent. The risk is low, matching the report's conclusion.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to previous, with obfuscation signs, but no direct malicious activity. Warnings about obfuscation and deprecated functions.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.4, Confidence 0.6.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly higher risk and malware scores than others, justified by the persistent obfuscation and complex code structure. Still, no concrete evidence of malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern—heavy obfuscation, complex API handling, but no malicious actions. Slightly lower malware and obfuscation scores.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.1, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.2, Confidence 0.6.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate, given the consistent obfuscation but lack of direct malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- The **obfuscation scores** are generally high (0.7-0.8), reflecting the intentionally obscure variable names and complex logic.\n- The **malware scores** are low (0.0-0.2), consistent with the absence of concrete malicious actions.\n- The **risk scores** are moderate (0.2-0.4), mainly due to obfuscation and potential concealment tactics.\n- The **confidence levels** are moderate to high, reflecting the suspicion but lack of definitive malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **obfuscation scores** are justified; they reflect the code's intentionally obscure variable names and complex structure.\n- The **malware scores** should remain low, as no direct malicious activity is evident.\n- The **risk scores** could be slightly increased to 0.4 for reports with higher obfuscation and deprecated warnings (e.g., Reports 2 and 4), but overall, they are reasonable.\n- No changes needed for the scores based on the evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** ~0.1 (consistent with the reports)\n- **Obfuscated score:** ~0.75 (average of 0.7-0.8)\n- **Risk score:** ~0.3 (considering the obfuscation and deprecated functions)\n\nThese estimates align with the reports' conclusions and the observed code characteristics.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' scores are reasonable and consistent with the observed obfuscation and lack of explicit malicious activity. The main concern is code concealment, but no concrete malware or supply chain attack evidence is present.",
