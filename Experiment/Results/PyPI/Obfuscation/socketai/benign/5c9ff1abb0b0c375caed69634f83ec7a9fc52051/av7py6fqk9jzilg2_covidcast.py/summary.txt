  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for legitimate COVID-19 data collection and processing, with high obfuscation levels that could be used to hide malicious activity. No concrete evidence of malware or supply chain attacks is present. The malware score is low, and the overall security risk is moderate due to obfuscation. Further static analysis is recommended before deployment."
