  "flows": "Reading README.md into variables, passing variables to setuptools.setup()",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names that do not follow typical naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which do not perform any malicious or suspicious operations. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input handling is present. Dependencies are standard packages. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not impact security. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious intent or security risks are detected. The obfuscation is superficial and does not compromise security.",
