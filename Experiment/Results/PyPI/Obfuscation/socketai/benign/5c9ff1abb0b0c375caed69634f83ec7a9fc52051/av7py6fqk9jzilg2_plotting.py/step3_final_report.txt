{
  "purpose": "The code provides geospatial visualization functions for US regions, including shapefile processing, spatial joins, plotting, and GIF creation, primarily for COVID-19 data mapping.",
  "sources": "Reads shapefiles, pandas DataFrames, and external modules; processes spatial data; loads shapefiles from resource paths.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data exfiltration, network activity, or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from shapefiles and DataFrames, merged and processed through spatial joins, then visualized via plotting functions, with optional GIF creation.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy variable and function name obfuscation; import of an invalid or suspicious module 'ogzTZoakhEwItfIccRiGWkrfWiELlvLO' from datetime; placeholder or nonsensical function names; reliance on external shapefiles and internal modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard geospatial data processing and visualization tasks. Obfuscation and suspicious imports suggest concealment but do not demonstrate malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The invalid import indicates possible obfuscation or placeholder code. No evidence of malicious routines or backdoors is present. The heavy obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate geospatial visualization toolkit with significant obfuscation, likely for concealment rather than malicious purposes. No signs of malware or sabotage are evident based on the static analysis. The current malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk remains low (~0.2). Further dynamic analysis and inspection of external modules are recommended for complete certainty.",
