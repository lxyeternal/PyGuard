  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate geospatial visualization toolkit with significant obfuscation, likely for concealment rather than malicious purposes. No signs of malware or sabotage are evident based on the static analysis. The current malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall security risk remains low (~0.2). Further dynamic analysis and inspection of external modules are recommended for complete certainty."
