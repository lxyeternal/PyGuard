{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle geospatial data visualization and manipulation, specifically related to US geographic regions, likely for epidemiological or demographic analysis.",
  "sources": "Data is read from shapefiles via pkg_resources and pandas DataFrames, with input data supplied externally to various functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is merged, transformed, and visualized using matplotlib and geopandas; no untrusted data directly flows into system commands or network operations.",
  "flows": "Data sources (shapefiles and input DataFrames) flow into spatial joins and transformations, which then feed into visualization functions that generate plots and images.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated variable and function names (e.g., FhXMvSNbXXGwWquzSIIWyiuReHbUDIMC), which is atypical for clean, open-source code. Usage of hard-coded geographic file paths and in-line data translation/manipulation might suggest attempts to mask intent. No obvious malicious logic is evident from data handling; no network or system calls are made.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple functions focused on geospatial data processing, merging, and plotting. The obfuscated naming pattern suggests an attempt to hinder understanding, but the code itself performs legitimate spatial joins, data filtering, and plotting routines typical for geospatial analysis. No code injections, network calls, or data exfiltration activities are present. The functions do not process or leak sensitive data such as credentials or environment variables. The heavy obfuscation appears to be an effort to obscure the code’s purpose, but no malicious behaviors such as backdoors, data theft, or malware delivery are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mainly concerned with geospatial data processing and visualization. Despite obfuscated variable and function names, no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware is observed. It appears to be a legitimate geospatial analysis tool with obfuscation likely aimed at obscurity rather than malicious activity.",
