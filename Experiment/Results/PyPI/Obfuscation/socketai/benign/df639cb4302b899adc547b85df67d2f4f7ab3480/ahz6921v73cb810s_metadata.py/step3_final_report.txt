  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal placeholder, declaring UTF-8 encoding without any executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a comment line declaring encoding.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data sources are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist due to lack of executable code or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a simple encoding declaration with no suspicious or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a UTF-8 encoding declaration, with no functions, variables, data sources, sinks, or logic. This minimal content indicates a benign placeholder or header. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's benign nature. The high confidence score of 1 reflects certainty in this assessment. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns, and the code does not perform any operations that could pose security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only a UTF-8 encoding declaration with no executable or malicious content. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's minimal nature. No further action or warnings are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
