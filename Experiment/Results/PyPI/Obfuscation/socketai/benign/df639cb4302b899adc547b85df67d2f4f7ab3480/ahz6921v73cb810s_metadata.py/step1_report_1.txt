  "purpose": "The provided code contains only a coding declaration and no functional logic or executable statements.",
  "sources": "No sources of input or data are present in the code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data could be processed or leaked are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow exists due to lack of operational code.",
  "anomalies": "The code is limited to a file encoding declaration and does not include any operational code; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a single line indicating the source file encoding (UTF-8). It does not include any functions, variables, imports, or data processing logic. Because it contains only a coding declaration, there are no sources, sinks, data flows, or potential security concerns. No malicious behavior or obfuscation can be inferred from such minimal content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is trivial and contains no executable logic or suspicious constructs. It poses no security risks or malicious intent. It is likely just a file encoding declaration with no malicious content.",
