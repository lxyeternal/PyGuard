  "anomalies": "The code only contains a UTF-8 encoding declaration and no executable logic, input/output, or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is minimal and only specifies the source file encoding. It does not perform any operations, read input, or contain any suspicious patterns. No external or untrusted data sources are present, and there are no sinks or data flows. The lack of actual code means there are no detectable security issues, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation. Given the minimal content, it appears to be a benign placeholder or standard file header.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, consisting solely of an encoding declaration with no executable or malicious content. No security concerns are identified.",
