  "purpose": "The code is a simple header specifying UTF-8 encoding, likely serving as the start of a larger script or module.",
  "sources": "No data sources, input reads, or external data sources are present in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks, data outputs, or points where untrusted data is processed or stored are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or logic flow is present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only an encoding declaration; no anomalies, suspicious code, or malicious constructs are observable.",
  "analysis": "This code fragment is a standard encoding declaration comment. It does not execute any logic or perform any data processing. It lacks any input handling, data transformation, or external interactions. Since it is only a file header, it provides no avenues for malicious activity, data leaks, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, standard header comment indicating UTF-8 encoding. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet.",
