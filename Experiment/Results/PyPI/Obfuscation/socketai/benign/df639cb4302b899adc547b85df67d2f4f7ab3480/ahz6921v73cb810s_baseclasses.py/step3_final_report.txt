  "purpose": "Documentation and interface description for the GeoArray class handling geospatial raster data.",
  "sources": "Parameter definitions and class/method descriptions; no data input or external data reading logic.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code is purely descriptive with no executable data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, logic, or suspicious patterns; extensive verbose documentation may suggest auto-generation but not obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of detailed docstrings outlining parameters, intended use, and data handling descriptions for a geospatial raster data class. No executable logic, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code is present. The documentation does not include any hardcoded secrets, obfuscation techniques, or suspicious patterns. Given the static, descriptive nature, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as comprehensive documentation for a geospatial data handling class. It contains no executable logic, no malware, no obfuscation, and poses no security risk. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1 to 0.2, which can be confidently set to 0 given the static, documentation-only content.",
