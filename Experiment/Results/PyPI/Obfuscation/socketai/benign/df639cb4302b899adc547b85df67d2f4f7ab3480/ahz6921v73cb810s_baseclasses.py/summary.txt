  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as comprehensive documentation for a geospatial data handling class. It contains no executable logic, no malware, no obfuscation, and poses no security risk. The current malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.1 to 0.2, which can be confidently set to 0 given the static, documentation-only content."
