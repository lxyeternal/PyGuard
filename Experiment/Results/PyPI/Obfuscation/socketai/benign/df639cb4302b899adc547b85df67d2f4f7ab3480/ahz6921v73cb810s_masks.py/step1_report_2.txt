  "flows": "None; no data flow or source-to-sink paths because the code does not execute any logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a comment, which is benign and common in Python files; no suspicious or unusual code elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a comment specifying the file's character encoding as UTF-8. There are no executable statements, functions, or imported modules. As such, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security concerns.",
