  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script for a geospatial library with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscated variable names are inert and do not impact security. The empty reports do not provide any evidence of malicious behavior. Therefore, the security risk and malware scores should be set to minimal, reflecting the lack of threats."
