{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module intended for data processing, possibly involving network communication or data transformation.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from variables, functions, or possibly external sources such as files or network streams (if present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Data may be sent over the network, written to files, or executed via eval/exec statements, depending on the code content.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks where it could be transmitted or executed.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation detected. Unusual function calls or dynamic execution are absent or not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets, unnecessary dynamic code execution, or communication with suspicious domains. Usage of third-party libraries is not inherently suspicious but should be verified for trustworthiness. The overall structure appears standard without obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no apparent signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no evident malicious intent or malware. The security risk score is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
