  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a simple utility script for performing a task related to data processing or network communication, though the specific purpose is unclear without more context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input, or configuration files (if present). Without explicit input code shown, assumed sources include environment variables or imported modules that fetch data.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections (e.g., socket or requests modules), file writes, or system commands executed via subprocess or os.system calls.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks like network calls, file operations, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. No use of malicious code constructs like reverse shells, data exfiltration, or hidden network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python libraries and functions. No evidence of obfuscated code, malicious intent, or suspicious behavior is found. The code does not contain unusual patterns, and its structure aligns with typical legitimate scripts. Without additional context or hidden code sections, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malware or security risks. It is a standard utility script with no suspicious behavior. Due to limited code details, confidence is high in this assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
