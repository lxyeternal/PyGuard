  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation, which raises suspicion but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The external functions and modules should be reviewed for their behavior. The current low malware score (around 0.3) and high obfuscation score (around 0.75) are appropriate. The overall security risk remains moderate (~0.4), primarily due to obfuscation and reliance on external, potentially untrusted modules. Further analysis of imported functions is recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."
