  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for legitimate geospatial map generation but employs obfuscation techniques that could be exploited maliciously if used with malicious inputs. It does not show direct evidence of malware or malicious activity but should be reviewed further, especially input validation and URL sources. The overall malware score is low (~0.2), obfuscation high (~0.8), and security risk moderate (~0.45). Continuous monitoring and input validation are recommended."
