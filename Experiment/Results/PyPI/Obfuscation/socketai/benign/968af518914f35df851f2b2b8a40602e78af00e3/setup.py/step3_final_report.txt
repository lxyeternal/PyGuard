{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated setup/configuration script importing a nonsensical class/function, with embedded secret string, likely used for package installation or deployment.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'distutils.core', hardcoded string 'g9ks2l90dewya048', package metadata parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of embedded secret in package setup, no direct data leaks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated class/function -> call with package metadata including secret string -> execution of entry point 'geos.scripts.runserver:run_app'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class/function name, import from 'distutils.core', embedded secret string, nonsensical variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a obfuscated entity from 'distutils.core' and calls it with package info, including a hardcoded secret. The obfuscation and embedded secret suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent or exfiltrate secrets. No active malicious actions are visible, but the structure and signals are suspicious. The embedded secret could be a credential or token, raising the risk of malicious use. The obfuscation level is high, and the presence of a secret increases concern. Static analysis indicates moderate to high risk, warranting further dynamic inspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and embedded secrets, indicating potential malicious intent or backdoor functionality. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the signals suggest caution. Further analysis is recommended before deployment.",
