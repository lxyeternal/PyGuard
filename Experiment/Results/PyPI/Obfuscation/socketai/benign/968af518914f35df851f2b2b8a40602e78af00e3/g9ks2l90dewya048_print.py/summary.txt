  "conclusion": "The code functions as a map tile downloader and renderer with obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or intellectual property reasons. The security risk is low, and the malware score should be near zero. The obfuscation score remains high due to variable naming complexity. Overall, the code appears legitimate for geographic visualization tasks."
