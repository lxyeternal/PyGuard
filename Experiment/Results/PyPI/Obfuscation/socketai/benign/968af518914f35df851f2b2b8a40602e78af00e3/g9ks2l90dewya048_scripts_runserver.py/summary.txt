  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Flask application setup with significant obfuscation but no malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in understanding variable purposes, but the overall security risk remains low. The malware score is justified at zero, and the low risk score is appropriate. No modifications are necessary; the code appears safe but warrants attention during code review for transparency concerns."
