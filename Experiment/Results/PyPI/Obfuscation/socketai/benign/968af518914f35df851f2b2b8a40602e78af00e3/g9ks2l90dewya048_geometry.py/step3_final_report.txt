  "purpose": "A geographic coordinate and spatial region processing library for mapping and GIS applications, performing coordinate transformations, tiling, and spatial intersections.",
  "sources": "Input parameters from class constructors and functions, internal generator functions producing coordinate ranges, class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks, network activity, or system interactions; calculations are internal and self-contained.",
  "flows": "Data flows through mathematical transformations within classes and functions, from input parameters to computed coordinate and region objects.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation via variable names and complex class structures; no external communication, secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code implements spatial utilities such as coordinate conversions, region intersections, and tiling. Obfuscated variable names and nested generator functions suggest attempts to conceal complexity, but no network calls, secrets, or malicious patterns are present. The operations are consistent with GIS processing. The obfuscation likely serves to hinder readability or reduce size, not to hide malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, geographic utility library. No evidence of malicious behavior or active security risks was found. The obfuscation does not necessarily imply malicious intent, and the overall security risk is low.",
