  "sources": "Import statement for 'geos.server'",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing or external data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow beyond module import and Flask app instantiation",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'CZQhAbLQKaWWdQPtraFZuXPanhEAlTGR' used for the Flask app instance; no other suspicious code or secrets detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports Flask and creates an application instance with an obfuscated variable name. It also imports a potentially custom or third-party module 'geos.server'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious external connections. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated but does not imply malicious intent. The code is minimal and does not execute any further actions or contain malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a simple setup for a Flask application with an unusual variable name. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks are present based on the provided snippet.",
