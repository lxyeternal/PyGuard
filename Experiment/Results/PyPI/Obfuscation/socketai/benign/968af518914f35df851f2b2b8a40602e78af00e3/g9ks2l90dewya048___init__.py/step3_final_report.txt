  "purpose": "Evaluate the provided Python code snippet for potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on supply chain security criteria.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'import geos.server' and the variable assignment 'CZQhAbLQKaWWdQPtraFZuXPanhEAlTGR = Flask(__name__)', which reads module imports and variable initialization.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks or malicious actions could occur if 'geos.server' is malicious, especially if it performs network communication or data exfiltration; however, no such behavior is evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code initializes a Flask app with an obfuscated variable name and imports 'geos.server'. No data flows or untrusted data handling are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'CZQhAbLQKaWWdQPtraFZuXPanhEAlTGR' is highly obfuscated, and the import of 'geos.server' is unusual and warrants caution; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a Flask application with an intentionally obfuscated variable name, which suggests obfuscation but not necessarily malicious intent. The import of 'geos.server' could be benign or malicious; without further context, it remains suspicious. No data flows, input handling, or malicious code are present. The minimal code indicates low security risk, but the obfuscation and external module import should be flagged for further review.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation, with obfuscation and an external module import that warrant caution. No active malicious behavior is evident. The overall security risk is low, but further investigation of 'geos.server' is recommended.",
