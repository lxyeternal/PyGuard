  "sources": "Reading module imports and Flask app initialization",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs",
  "anomalies": "Variable name 'CZQhAbLQKaWWdQPtraFZuXPanhEAlTGR' is unusually long and nonsensical, which might indicate obfuscation or code obfuscation attempt. Import of 'geos.server' could be benign or suspicious depending on context, but alone is not necessarily malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Flask framework and creates an app instance with a highly obfuscated variable name. It then imports a module named 'geos.server'. The obfuscated variable name may be an attempt to conceal code intent or evade detection. The import of 'geos.server' is unusual; without additional context, it could be benign or could suggest malicious intent if 'geos.server' is a malicious module. No other code, input handling, or data processing is present. There are no obvious signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network calls, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple Flask app setup with obfuscated variable naming. No clear malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscated name warrants caution, and the imported 'geos.server' module should be reviewed for legitimacy.",
