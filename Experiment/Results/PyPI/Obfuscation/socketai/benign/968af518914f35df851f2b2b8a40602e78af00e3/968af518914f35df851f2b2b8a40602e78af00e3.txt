      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation, which raises suspicion but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The external functions and modules should be reviewed for their behavior. The current low malware score (around 0.3) and high obfuscation score (around 0.75) are appropriate. The overall security risk remains moderate (~0.4), primarily due to obfuscation and reliance on external, potentially untrusted modules. Further analysis of imported functions is recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a map tile downloader and renderer with obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or intellectual property reasons. The security risk is low, and the malware score should be near zero. The obfuscation score remains high due to variable naming complexity. Overall, the code appears legitimate for geographic visualization tasks."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate; only the security risk scores should be lowered to reflect the low risk. Overall, the code poses no security threat."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate map configuration processing code with significant obfuscation. While the obfuscation and dynamic URL handling could be exploited if inputs are malicious, there is no evidence of malware or malicious activity within this snippet. The primary concern is reliance on external XML inputs which, if malicious, could manipulate URL templates or configurations. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, but obfuscation warrants cautious review of input validation."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily for legitimate geospatial map generation but employs obfuscation techniques that could be exploited maliciously if used with malicious inputs. It does not show direct evidence of malware or malicious activity but should be reviewed further, especially input validation and URL sources. The overall malware score is low (~0.2), obfuscation high (~0.8), and security risk moderate (~0.45). Continuous monitoring and input validation are recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign Flask application setup with significant obfuscation but no malicious activity. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in understanding variable purposes, but the overall security risk remains low. The malware score is justified at zero, and the low risk score is appropriate. No modifications are necessary; the code appears safe but warrants attention during code review for transparency concerns."

The overall risk remains low, with no evidence of malware, and only moderate suspicion of obfuscation in report 5. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are appropriate based on the provided information."
