{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define configuration or environment variables, likely for a network service or application.",
  "sources": "Assignments to variables at the start of the code",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls are present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; variables are assigned static values only",
  "anomalies": "Variables are assigned seemingly arbitrary or obfuscated names; no code execution, input, or suspicious operations present. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static boolean, string, and integer values to variables with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. There is no evidence of code injection, data leakage, environment variable misuse, or malicious logic. No network activity, file operations, or obfuscated code segments are present. The code functions as simple variable declarations, likely for configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting solely of variable assignments used for configuration or setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks.",
