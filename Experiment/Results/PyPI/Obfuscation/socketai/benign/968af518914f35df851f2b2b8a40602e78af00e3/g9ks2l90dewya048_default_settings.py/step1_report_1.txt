{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define configuration variables, likely for a network-related application.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements that initialize variables with hardcoded values.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data output points; no use of external inputs or untrusted data sources.",
  "flows": "The variables are assigned static values; there are no data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variables have non-descriptive, obfuscated-like names, but contain benign values (boolean, string, integer). No dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, and no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with static values. Variable names are obfuscated but do not reveal malicious intent. No external data is read, no data is sent, and no suspicious operations are present. The code does not include any network activity, file manipulation, or other actions that could indicate malicious behavior. The simplicity suggests configuration or placeholder values rather than malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The code appears to be benign, serving as configuration variables. No malicious intent or security threats are identified.",
