  "purpose": "Static configuration variables with obfuscated names, likely for network or application setup.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static values to variables; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flow, no data leaks, no network activity.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior or code injection.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments with obfuscated names, containing benign data types and values. No functions, no dynamic code, no external inputs, and no network activity are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with malware scores at 0. The obfuscation scores are justified by variable naming but do not imply malicious activity. Security risk scores are slightly overestimated in some reports; given the static, configuration-only code, a score of 0 would be more accurate. The confidence in benign assessment is high (above 0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security vulnerabilities. The existing reports are accurate; only the security risk scores should be lowered to reflect the low risk. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
