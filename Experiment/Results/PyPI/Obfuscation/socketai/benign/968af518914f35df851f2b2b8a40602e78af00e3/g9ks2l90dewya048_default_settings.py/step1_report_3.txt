{
  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize configuration variables, likely for a network or application setup.",
  "sources": "The variables are assigned static values directly within the code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are assigned static constants only.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are hardcoded with fixed values; no input handling or dynamic execution observed. No obfuscation or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code sets several variables with seemingly standard configuration data: a boolean flag, a localhost string, a port number, and a numeric flag. There is no evidence of input, data leaks, network activity, or malicious logic. The static assignment suggests configuration or initialization, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving as configuration setup without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
