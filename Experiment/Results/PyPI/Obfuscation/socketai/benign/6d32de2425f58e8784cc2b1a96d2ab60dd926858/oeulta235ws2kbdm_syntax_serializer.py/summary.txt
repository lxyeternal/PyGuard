  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated AST processing utility with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The high obfuscation level is justified but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), consistent with the analysis."
