{
  "purpose": "The code acts as a wrapper that imports obfuscated modules and delegates method calls, potentially concealing malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.parser' and '.serializer' modules, instantiation of classes/functions with arbitrary kwargs, method calls on these objects.",
  "sinks": "Method invocations that process 'source' and 'resource' data, potential indirect data flow depending on imported modules.",
  "flows": "Instantiation from imported modules with kwargs -> method calls passing 'source' or 'resource' -> data processing or transmission depending on module implementations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and class names, dynamic invocation patterns, lack of transparency about imported modules, no explicit malicious code visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is a heavily obfuscated wrapper delegating functionality to imported modules. No direct malicious activity such as network connections, data exfiltration, or hardcoded secrets is evident. The obfuscation and dynamic invocation patterns are suspicious but could be benign. The scores from reports reflect high obfuscation (0.8), moderate malware suspicion (0.3), and moderate security risk (0.45). These are consistent with the code's structure and the uncertainty about imported modules. Further investigation into the modules' internal implementations is recommended to confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and indirect invocation, raising suspicion but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate; however, caution is advised. Further analysis of the imported modules is necessary before making definitive security judgments.",
