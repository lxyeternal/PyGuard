{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide wrapper functions that invoke methods from imported modules, likely for processing or transforming data.",
  "sources": "Data sources are indirectly referenced via function arguments 'source' and 'resource'. No direct input reading or untrusted data sources identified within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the method calls 'hvDycddivSUeBmnvJtUIzVzveIUewUoU.gFQENiokzVFFyAemCrIWBWDUWojcJBAf' and 'eHivyvKdKVTmlbxMeQmMXPIZbsPJRmZG.OqdQGWchHhFbYntiYQldDzVFSvxrWURl', which could process data, but no explicit malicious behavior is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function parameters 'source' and 'resource' into method calls from imported modules, then returns their outputs; no indication of untrusted data being manipulated maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable and function names suggests code obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URLs, or malicious code patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules and defines two wrapper functions that call methods from these modules with provided arguments. The parameter names and internal variables are obfuscated, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose. There are no suspicious network connections, system modifications, or data exfiltration code. The code appears to serve as a simple pass-through or abstraction layer, with no evident malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Due to obfuscation, some uncertainty remains about the modules' internal behaviors, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as wrappers around external module methods, with no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent.",
