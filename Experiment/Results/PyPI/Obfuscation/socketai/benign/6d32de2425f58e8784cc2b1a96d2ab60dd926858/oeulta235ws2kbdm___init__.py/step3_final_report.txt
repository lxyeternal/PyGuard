  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages by extending __path__ using pkgutil's extend_path method.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it imports 'pkgutil' dynamically via __import__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; no data leaks or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code simply modifies __path__ for namespace support.",
  "anomalies": "Uses __import__ instead of a direct import, which is unconventional but not malicious; no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It employs dynamic import, which is common in such contexts. No malicious activity, data leaks, or obfuscation are evident. The use of __import__ introduces a minimal potential for misuse if combined with malicious inputs elsewhere, but in this isolated snippet, it is benign. The security risk score of 0.1 reflects this cautious consideration, but the overall assessment remains safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation for namespace package extension. No malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
