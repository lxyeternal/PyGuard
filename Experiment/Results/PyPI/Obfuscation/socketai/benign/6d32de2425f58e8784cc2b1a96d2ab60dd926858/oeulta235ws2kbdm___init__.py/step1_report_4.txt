  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resource discovery.",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks related to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkgutil' to extend __path__ for resource lookup; no data flows to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ with a string argument; typical for dynamic imports but not suspicious here.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the current package's __path__ variable. This pattern is common for namespace packages, allowing multiple directories to contribute to a single package namespace. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is minimal and serves a standard purpose in package resource management.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a legitimate operation related to Python package namespace management. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
