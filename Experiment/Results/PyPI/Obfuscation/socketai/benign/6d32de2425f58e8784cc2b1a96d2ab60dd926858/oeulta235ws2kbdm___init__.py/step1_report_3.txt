  "purpose": "Extend the current package's search path for module discovery.",
  "sources": "__path__ variable, imported 'pkgutil' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "The code modifies __path__, which affects module resolution, but does not involve data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "The code uses dynamic import and modifies __path__, which could be exploited to load malicious modules if combined with malicious inputs, but on its own this is a standard pattern for namespace packages",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'pkgutil' module to call 'extend_path' on __path__, a standard practice for namespace packages in Python. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or malicious patterns are present. The operation itself is safe and common in package structures. There are no obfuscation indicators, and no suspicious behaviors or anomalies beyond typical namespace package handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package pattern used to extend the package search path. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
