  "purpose": "Obfuscated setup configuration with suspicious embedded strings and non-standard parameters, potentially hiding secrets or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string 'oeulta235ws2kbdm' to parameter 'eFulKpemOlgPrNOwLJzkBJnENjBUTgqs'; use of non-standard parameters such as 'gtWHYBZCVPsGFJrfAsLZKNheZBPdDUfp'; static data in setup() call.",
  "sinks": "None active; static configuration data, no network or file operations, only package setup parameters.",
  "flows": "Assignment of obfuscated strings to non-standard parameters; no data flow leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Non-standard, obfuscated parameter names; suspicious string literals; potential embedded secrets; lack of standard setup arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains obfuscated variable names and suspicious string literals, notably 'oeulta235ws2kbdm' assigned to a non-standard parameter. These signs suggest possible hiding of secrets or malicious intent. No active malicious behavior such as network activity or code execution is present. The malware score remains low (~0.2), reflecting no confirmed malicious actions. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), consistent with suspicious naming and data. The security risk score is moderate (~0.4), due to potential embedded secrets and obfuscation. The scores are aligned with the static analysis, indicating caution but no definitive malicious activity. Further investigation is recommended to confirm the purpose of embedded strings and obfuscated parameters.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and potential embedding of secrets, raising suspicion. While no active malicious actions are evident, the obfuscation and suspicious strings justify a cautious approach. The overall malware score is low, but the obfuscation and embedded data warrant further scrutiny before trusting or deploying this package.",
