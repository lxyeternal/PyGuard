{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom exception class and a function to generate error messages based on error codes, likely used for error handling in a parser or validator.",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'code' parameter and the 'qEuRCtTcyARNIFmsBibHUckvVBVszMHF' list (or tuple) passed to the function, which are used to generate error messages.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access are present. The code only constructs strings for error messages.",
  "flows": "The flow involves passing an error code and optional arguments to generate a corresponding error message; no untrusted data flow to sensitive sinks is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be obfuscated with randomly generated class and function names, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose. However, no malicious code such as network communication, file modification, or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class with an initializer that stores an error code and arguments. The function AHYFIYHpcShazQRCmMAXkTgFIBnvnEmU generates error messages based on the code, inserting arguments where necessary. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data leaks, network activity, or backdoors. The obfuscation may be intended to hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code performs standard error message handling with no malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard error message generator with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal the purpose rather than malicious intent. Security risks are minimal.",
