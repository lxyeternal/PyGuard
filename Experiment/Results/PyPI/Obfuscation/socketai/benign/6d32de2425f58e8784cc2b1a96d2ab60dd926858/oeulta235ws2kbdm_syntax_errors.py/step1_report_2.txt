  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class and a function to generate error messages based on error codes and parameters.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'code' and 'qEuRCtTcyARNIFmsBibHUckvVBVszMHF' for the function AHYFIYHpcShazQRCmMAXkTgFIBnvnEmU",
  "sinks": "String formatting operations within the function, mainly constructing error messages",
  "flows": "Input 'code' and 'qEuRCtTcyARNIFmsBibHUckvVBVszMHF' influence the generated error message strings",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names; no evident hardcoded credentials or backdoors; code appears to be benign message generation logic",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class that stores an error code and message. The message is generated via a function that maps error codes to predefined strings, some of which include string formatting with parameters. The function only constructs and returns error message strings based on input; no external data access, network activity, or system modification is evident. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious code execution, file operations, or network calls are present. The code appears solely to handle error message generation, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign error message handling module with no malicious intent. It simply maps error codes to messages, some with string formatting. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malware. The obfuscation is limited to variable naming, not malicious complexity.",
