{
  "purpose": "This code defines a custom exception class and a function that generates error messages based on error codes, likely for use in parsing or validation routines.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from the 'code' parameter and 'qEuRCtTcyARNIFmsBibHUckvVBVszMHF' parameter, which supplies additional context for error messages.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks; it only formats and returns error message strings. No data is written to external systems, network, or files.",
  "flows": "Input error code and optional message components are used to generate and return specific error messages; no external data flow or untrusted data handling is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are highly obfuscated, which is suspicious and indicates potential attempt to conceal intent. No external data sources, network connections, or sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be part of a larger validation or localization system.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class that captures an error code and message. The function 'AHYFIYHpcShazQRCmMAXkTgFIBnvnEmU' returns error messages based on specific error codes, some with formatted strings incorporating provided parameters. The obfuscated variable names and lack of external interactions suggest an attempt to conceal the code's purpose. There are no signs of malicious actions such as network activity, file access, or system modifications. The logic is straightforward and benign, focused solely on error message formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a utility for error handling with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent. The obfuscation might be suspicious, but within the context, it seems to serve to obscure the error messaging system rather than conceal malicious activity.",
