  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class and a function to generate error messages based on error codes and optional arguments.",
  "sources": "The function AHYFIYHpcShazQRCmMAXkTgFIBnvnEmU reads the 'code' and 'qEuRCtTcyARNIFmsBibHUckvVBVszMHF' parameters to generate messages.",
  "sinks": "The code uses string formatting to generate error messages. No direct data leaks or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Input 'code' and 'qEuRCtTcyARNIFmsBibHUckvVBVszMHF' flow into the message generation in AHYFIYHpcShazQRCmMAXkTgFIBnvnEmU. No other data flow or external system interaction is present.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which could indicate code obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or malicious backdoors are detected. The code does not perform any malicious actions or system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class with an initializer that assigns a message generated by the function AHYFIYHpcShazQRCmMAXkTgFIBnvnEmU based on the provided error code and arguments. The function maps error codes to human-readable messages, formatting strings with provided arguments where necessary. The variable naming is intentionally obscure, which might suggest obfuscation, but the logic is straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The code primarily handles error message formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign error message handler with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. Its purpose is to generate descriptive error messages based on error codes. The obfuscation is likely to deter casual analysis but does not imply malicious intent.",
