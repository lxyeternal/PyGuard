  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Defines a custom exception class `QbqeFPJdyAiesylkhXGWwsgxmcIPfMOY`.\n- The exception stores an error code and message arguments.\n- The function `AHYFIYHpcShazQRCmMAXkTgFIBnvnEmU` maps error codes to descriptive messages, some with string formatting using provided arguments.\n- Variable names are obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward: error code lookup and message formatting.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** perform any malicious actions.\n- It is purely for error handling and message generation.\n- String formatting with untrusted input could pose risks if misused elsewhere, but within this isolated context, it appears safe.\n- No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or system modifications are present.\n\n### Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes:\n- The only concern is **obfuscation** of variable and function names, which can hinder readability and maintainability.\n- The use of `.format()` with parameters is safe here, as the inputs are used only for message formatting, not for code execution.\n- No actual vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### Score Review:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (correct). No malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** The reports give high obfuscation scores (0.8), which is justified given the nonsensical variable names.\n- **Risk Score:** The reports assign low risk (around 0.2). Given the benign nature, this seems appropriate.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- The code's purpose is limited to error message formatting.\n- No external data, network, or system access.\n- Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, though it can be suspicious.\n- Overall, the low risk score (0.2) is justified.\n\n### Potential Claims and Assumptions:\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on assumptions; the code is straightforward.\n- The only minor concern is the obfuscation, but it does not constitute a security risk.\n\n### Consistency of Scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware = 0, obfuscated = high, risk = low.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.8 (obfuscated variable and function names)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 (low, benign error handling code)\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe code is a benign error handling utility with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious intent or security risks are evident. The obfuscation may be to hinder casual analysis but does not imply malicious activity.\n\n**Recommendation:** No changes needed to the scores; the current assessment is appropriate.",
