  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; use of string formatting with input arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class that stores an error code and message arguments. The function maps error codes to specific messages, some with string formatting using provided arguments. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward: error code lookup and message formatting. No external data access, network activity, or system modifications are present. The use of string formatting with input variables could pose risks if inputs are untrusted, but within this context, it is limited to error message generation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system compromise are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, serving to hinder analysis rather than conceal malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign error message utility with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The use of string formatting is limited to error messages and does not pose a security risk in this context.",
