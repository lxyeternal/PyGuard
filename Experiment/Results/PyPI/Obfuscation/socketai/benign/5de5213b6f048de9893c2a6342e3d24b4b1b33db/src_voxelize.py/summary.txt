  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated scientific or visualization library performing legitimate data processing tasks. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or external threats. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in review but does not imply malicious intent. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate given the analysis."
