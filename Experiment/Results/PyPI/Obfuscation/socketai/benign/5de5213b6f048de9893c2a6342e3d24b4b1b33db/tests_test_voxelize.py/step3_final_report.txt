  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on signals such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or code anomalies.",
  "sources": "Code input, configuration files, import statements, network calls, environment variable accesses",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, environment variable access points",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network transmission, file modification)",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, unusual code constructs, unnecessary dynamic execution, obfuscation indicators",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python package setup script with no suspicious behavior or obfuscation. No external network activity, credential leaks, or malicious logic are evident. The code structure is typical, with no anomalies or obfuscation signs. Given the minimal content, confidence in malicious intent is very low. The security risk is negligible, and obfuscation is absent. The overall assessment indicates a safe, benign package with no malicious or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is set to 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1 to reflect minimal uncertainty due to limited code complexity. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
