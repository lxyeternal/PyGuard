  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign package configuration script with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is set to 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1 to reflect minimal uncertainty due to limited code complexity. Confidence in this assessment is high."
