  "purpose": "This script appears to be a simple Python script with only a shebang line, intended to specify the interpreter for execution.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input mechanisms are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points of data output or external communication are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow can be identified from the code.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a shebang line with no executable statements, input handling, or external interactions. Lack of code suggests it is incomplete or a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The script consists solely of a shebang line ('#!/usr/bin/env python3') with no additional code, functions, classes, or data operations. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The absence of logic or data handling means no source-to-sink flow exists. The code appears to be either a minimal stub or an incomplete file.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security issues. It is a minimal script with no functionality, likely a placeholder or starting point.",
