  "purpose": "Minimal placeholder script containing only a shebang line, serving as an entry point or stub.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only a shebang line with no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, output, or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks due to absence of code logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is just a shebang line with no suspicious or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) with no additional code, functions, or data handling. All reports correctly identify this minimal nature, with no security risks, malicious behavior, or obfuscation. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign and placeholder status. No logical errors or vulnerabilities are present, and the code cannot perform any malicious actions in this form.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal placeholder script with no security concerns, malware, or obfuscation. The existing reports are accurate, and no modifications are necessary.",
