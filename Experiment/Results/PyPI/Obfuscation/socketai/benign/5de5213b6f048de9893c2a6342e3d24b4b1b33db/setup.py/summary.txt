  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a native extension, with heavily obfuscated identifiers that warrant caution. No evidence of malware or malicious payloads is present. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware score remains at 0.1 due to lack of malicious activity. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), primarily due to obfuscation. Further source code review and context are recommended before deployment."
