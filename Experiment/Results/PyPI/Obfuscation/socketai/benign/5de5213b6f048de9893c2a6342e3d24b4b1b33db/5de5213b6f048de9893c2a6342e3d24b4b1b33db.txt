      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a native extension, with heavily obfuscated identifiers that warrant caution. No evidence of malware or malicious payloads is present. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware score remains at 0.1 due to lack of malicious activity. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.4), primarily due to obfuscation. Further source code review and context are recommended before deployment."

Although no direct malicious actions such as network activity or data exfiltration are evident, the suspicious patterns warrant caution. Further analysis in a sandbox environment is recommended before deployment. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware likelihood around 0.5, primarily due to obfuscation and eval usage."

The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in review but does not imply malicious intent. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate given the analysis."

The security risk is negligible, and the malware score is set to 0. The obfuscation score is 0, and the overall security risk score is 0.1 to reflect minimal uncertainty due to limited code complexity. Confidence in this assessment is high."
