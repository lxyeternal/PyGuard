{
  "purpose": "This code defines a Sphinx extension that mocks the 'pymol' module and its submodule 'cgo' to safely extract docstrings from 'macromol_voxelize.pymol' attributes for documentation purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads module attributes via getattr, and retrieves docstrings from 'macromol_voxelize.pymol' attributes based on directive arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code inserts the retrieved docstrings into documentation nodes; no untrusted data flows into system or network effects.",
  "flows": "Source: getattr(macromol_voxelize.pymol, argument); Sink: nodes.literal_block with the attribute's __doc__",
  "anomalies": "Use of MagicMock to mock 'pymol' modules, which could be suspicious outside documentation context but is standard here; dynamic attribute access is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code employs mocking to prevent execution of 'pymol' during documentation build, safely retrieves docstrings for inclusion in docs, and uses dynamic attribute access controlled by directive arguments. No malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The use of mocks and dynamic access is typical for documentation tooling, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Sphinx extension for documentation, employing module mocking and dynamic attribute retrieval. No malicious intent or security risks are evident; the scores of malware 0, risk ~0.2, obfuscated ~0.1-0.2 are appropriate.",
