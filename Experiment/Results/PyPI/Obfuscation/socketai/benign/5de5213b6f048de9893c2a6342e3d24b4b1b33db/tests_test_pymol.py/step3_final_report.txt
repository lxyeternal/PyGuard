  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, file reads, network connections, dynamic code execution, and function calls.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points, and data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs through functions or obfuscated code to sinks like network or file system.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (score 0.7), complex data flows, dynamic execution, inconsistent naming, and signs of covert data handling without explicit malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and complex data flows, suggesting potential covert activities, but no definitive malicious actions such as data exfiltration or system damage are confirmed. The suspicion is primarily based on obfuscation and dynamic features, with no hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads identified. The scores reflect a cautious stance, with moderate malware suspicion (0.3) and high obfuscation (0.7). Other reports indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, aligning with low malware and obfuscation scores. Overall, the assessment indicates a moderate security concern primarily due to obfuscation and complexity, but lacking concrete evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation and complex data handling, raising moderate suspicion, but no explicit malicious activity is confirmed. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with the highest concern in report 2. No further adjustments are necessary unless additional code or context is provided.",
