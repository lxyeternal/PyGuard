{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of comments or documentation; it appears to be a Python module that may involve data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "The code writes data to standard output, files, or external network endpoints, or stores sensitive data in variables or logs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (function arguments, environment variables) through processing functions, potentially leading to outputs, logs, or network transmissions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious dynamic code execution; however, there may be unusual constructs such as dynamic attribute access or obscure variable names that warrant closer review.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with standard Python constructs. No obfuscated code, eval statements, or dynamic imports are detected. Usage of third-party libraries seems typical and not suspicious. The absence of hardcoded secrets or network connections suggests low malicious intent. The structure does not indicate malware behavior such as data exfiltration, system damage, or backdoors. The code's logic seems benign, focused on data manipulation without evident security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose with no indicators of supply chain attacks or malware. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the lack of suspicious patterns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
