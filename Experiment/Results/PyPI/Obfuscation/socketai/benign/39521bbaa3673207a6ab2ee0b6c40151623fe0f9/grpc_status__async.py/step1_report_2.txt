  "purpose": "Asynchronous gRPC server-side handler function for processing status responses, validating status codes and messages.",
  "sources": "Call data from 'call' object, specifically 'xZKjGCFEkAWYbPGKnGPljFVTlRUGcuNy', 'LiJbIMyXjoojaQhJJMUaGUjMuvHCbrRJ', and 'sBSPgGPUgoDvRirJsefiHGmxkZfVoDoM'. Data retrieved from call method calls.",
  "sinks": "Potentially raises ValueError with status proto data, but does not write or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Input data from call object → status proto parsing and comparison → possible exception raising if mismatches occur.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. Use of dynamic data via await calls is standard. No obfuscation or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward async function handling a gRPC call. It retrieves three pieces of data from the call object, performs validation on a status message obtained from 'sBSPgGPUgoDvRirJsefiHGmxkZfVoDoM', and raises exceptions if mismatches are found. All data manipulations involve parsing and comparison; no data is transmitted externally or stored maliciously. The function's logic appears standard for validation purposes. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident, nor are there signs of code injection, backdoors, or malware-like behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical validation handler for gRPC status responses, performing integrity checks without any malicious intent or security risks. No indicators of supply chain attacks or malware are present.",
