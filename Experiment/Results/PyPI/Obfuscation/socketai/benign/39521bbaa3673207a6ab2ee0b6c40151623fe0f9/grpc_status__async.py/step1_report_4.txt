  "purpose": "Asynchronous gRPC server-side handler function that processes status responses and performs validation checks.",
  "sources": "Reads data from call object methods: call.xZKjGCFEkAWYbPGKnGPljFVTlRUGcuNy(), call.LiJbIMyXjoojaQhJJMUaGUjMuvHCbrRJ(), call.sBSPgGPUgoDvRirJsefiHGmxkZfVoDoM(); reads from status_pb2 and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Uses status_pb2.Status.FromString() which parses data from a string, and raises ValueError if validation fails.",
  "flows": "Data flows from call methods into validation logic; data from call.sBSPgGPUgoDvRirJsefiHGmxkZfVoDoM is iterated; status data is parsed and checked against call data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors detected. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed. Variable names are nonsensical, possibly auto-generated, but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is an async function that retrieves multiple data points from a call object, performs validation checks comparing status codes and messages. It uses protobuf parsing for status validation. No external inputs are directly used, no network activity or data exfiltration code. The function raises exceptions upon mismatches, which is typical validation behavior. No malicious patterns such as data theft, network exploits, or backdoors are present. The code appears to serve a legitimate validation purpose within a gRPC framework.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard status validation with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It does not contain suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious side effects. The overall security risk is minimal.",
