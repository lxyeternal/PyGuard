  "purpose": "Map gRPC status codes to associated values and provide a lookup function with error handling.",
  "sources": "Reads from grpc.StatusCode to construct a dictionary mapping status codes to values.",

  "flows": "Input status code -> dictionary lookup -> return value or exception.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, unusual dictionary comprehension, mapping status codes to the entire list of status codes in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward status code handler with obfuscated variable names. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment. The dictionary construction is somewhat convoluted but benign. Error handling is standard. No vulnerabilities or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated gRPC status code handler with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. Obfuscation is likely stylistic or for concealment, not malicious. Scores are consistent with this assessment.",
