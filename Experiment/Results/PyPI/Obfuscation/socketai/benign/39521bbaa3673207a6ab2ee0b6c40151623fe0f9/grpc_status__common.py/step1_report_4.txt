  "purpose": "Map gRPC status codes to corresponding values from a predefined dictionary.",
  "sources": "The input parameter xZKjGCFEkAWYbPGKnGPljFVTlRUGcuNy, which is used as a key to access the dictionary.",
  "sinks": "The dictionary access JThhLiYzDjkyMzDLBIbnSwcVsfqSkYFD[xZKjGCFEkAWYbPGKnGPljFVTlRUGcuNy], which retrieves data based on the input key.",
  "flows": "Input parameter -> Dictionary lookup -> Return value or raise error",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; dynamic mapping based on grpc.StatusCode; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a mapping between gRPC status codes and some associated values. The mapping dictionary is constructed dynamically from grpc.StatusCode, which is an enumeration. The function XIQMGPZMsTrnovUVMwyMVuEDDxcuvQjU attempts to retrieve the value for a given status code, raising an error if the code is not present. Variable names are obfuscated, but the logic appears straightforward. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or hidden backdoors. The code simply performs a safe lookup with error handling.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard status code mapping function with obfuscated variable names but no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign part of a larger gRPC-based system.",
