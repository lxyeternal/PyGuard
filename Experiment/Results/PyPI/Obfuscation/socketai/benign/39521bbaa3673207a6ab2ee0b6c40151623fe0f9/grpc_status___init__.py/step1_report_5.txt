  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but no specific purpose can be clearly determined from the provided fragment.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters, environment variables, or external modules; specifics are unclear due to incomplete code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file system writes, or environment variable modifications, but no explicit sinks are evident in the fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (parameters or environment variables) through processing functions, but the exact source-to-sink paths cannot be confirmed due to incomplete code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code patterns are identified. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is incomplete; it contains standard import statements and function definitions without clear malicious indicators. There are no signs of suspicious API calls, obfuscated code, or malicious data handling. Without further context, no malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or significant security risks. The code appears benign, but a full review of the complete codebase is recommended for thorough assessment.",
