  "purpose": "To evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on supply chain security best practices.",
  "sources": "Imports, function definitions, data handling, environment variable usage, network calls, and any hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, database queries, or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Source inputs such as user input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are predominantly minimal or incomplete, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. The extensive imports without usage could suggest incomplete code or potential obfuscation, but no concrete malicious indicators are present. The absence of hardcoded secrets, suspicious API calls, or data leaks supports a benign assessment. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are consistent with the limited context, reflecting low risk but acknowledging incomplete information. Confidence levels are moderate to high given the lack of suspicious features. No significant anomalies are detected, and the overall structure indicates no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified given the limited snippets. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary at this time.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
