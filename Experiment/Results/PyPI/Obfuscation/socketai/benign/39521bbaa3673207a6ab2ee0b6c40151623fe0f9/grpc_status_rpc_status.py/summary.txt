  "conclusion": "The code is a standard gRPC status validation utility with obfuscated variable names. It performs validation and conversion without malicious intent. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the absence of malicious or risky operations. Obfuscation is present but not indicative of malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign and appropriate for its purpose."
