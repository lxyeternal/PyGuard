{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version-related variables, possibly for managing or checking Python version compatibility.",
  "sources": "The variables are assigned hardcoded lists and float values directly within the script.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks such as network calls, file writes, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static values.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which can be a sign of obfuscation. No other unusual code patterns or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with obfuscated variable names. The list appears to contain version strings, and the other two variables store float values resembling version numbers. There are no functions, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. Given the simplicity, there are no evident malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign and likely related to version management. There is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks.",
