{
  "purpose": "Defines a list of Python version strings and two float variables representing version numbers, likely for compatibility or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of version list and version floats; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data assigned to variables only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not convey meaning; no functions, input/output, or dynamic code; no malicious patterns or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments with obfuscated names, representing version information. There are no functions, external data handling, network activity, or dynamic behavior. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for naming obfuscation rather than malicious concealment. No signs of malware, data leakage, or malicious logic are present. The code's purpose seems to be version management or compatibility checks, with no security risks or malicious intent evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static version data with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the code's simplicity confirms its harmless nature.",
