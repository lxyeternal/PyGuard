{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define version-related variables and a list of supported versions.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments, specifically the list and numeric version variables",
  "sinks": "None identified; no output, network, or data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; variables are assigned static values",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that are non-descriptive, but no malicious code patterns are evident; no hardcoded secrets or code obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists of variable assignments with seemingly arbitrary or obfuscated variable names. It lists software version strings and assigns specific numeric version values. There are no input reads, no data processing, and no suspicious functions or operations. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily defining version-related data with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
