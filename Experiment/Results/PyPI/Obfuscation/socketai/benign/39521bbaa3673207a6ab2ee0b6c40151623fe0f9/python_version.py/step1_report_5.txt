{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define variables related to Python version strings, potentially for version checking or selection.",
  "sources": "Variables assignment at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data flows to external systems or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are non-descriptive and appear obfuscated; no meaningful logic or function calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of Python version strings and two numeric variables representing specific Python versions. The variable names are non-descriptive, which could suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent. No input reading, external data access, or security-sensitive operations are evident. The absence of functions, modules, or operations limits potential malicious behavior. Overall, the code seems to serve as configuration or version info, with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be simple variable declarations related to Python versions, possibly obfuscated but without any harmful logic or external interactions.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
