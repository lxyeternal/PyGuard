{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define some variables related to Python version numbers, possibly for version comparison or selection.",
  "sources": "The variables are assigned hardcoded list and float values, which do not take external input.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted input or data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks; the variables are statically assigned.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are nonsensical and obfuscated, with no meaningful identifiers. No actual malicious code or obfuscation techniques are evident beyond naming. The code structure is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a list of version strings and two float variables, likely representing Python versions. No functions, input handling, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent; they could be auto-generated or deliberately obscure. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data leakage, malicious network activity, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign. It merely stores version data in variables with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
