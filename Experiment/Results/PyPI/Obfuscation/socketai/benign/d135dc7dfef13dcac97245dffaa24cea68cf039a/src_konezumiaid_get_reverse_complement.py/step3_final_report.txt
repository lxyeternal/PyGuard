  "purpose": "Performs a reverse complement operation on a nucleotide sequence string, reversing the input and mapping each base to its complement.",
  "sources": "Input string vQwONCAgJiOxrcRXqBjYNDyISVuJqNHJ",
  "sinks": "Return of the transformed string; no external data or network activity",
  "flows": "Input string -> reversed string -> character-by-character complement mapping -> output string",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no external I/O or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code executes a standard reverse complement of a nucleotide sequence, using a dictionary for base pairing, with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or external system interaction is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment, but does not imply malicious intent. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical bioinformatics operations. No security vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of a reverse complement function for nucleotide sequences. Despite obfuscation, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation level is moderate to high due to variable naming, and the overall security risk is very low.",
