  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical bioinformatics sequence analysis pipeline with obfuscated naming. While external dependencies are a concern, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score (0.2), moderate obfuscation score (0.4), and low security risk score (0.3) are consistent with this assessment. Continuous verification of external functions is recommended before deployment in sensitive environments."
