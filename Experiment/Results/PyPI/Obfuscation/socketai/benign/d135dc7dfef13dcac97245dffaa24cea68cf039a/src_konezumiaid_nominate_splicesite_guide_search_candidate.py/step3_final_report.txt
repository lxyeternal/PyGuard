{
  "purpose": "The code performs biological sequence analysis, extracting motifs, filtering sequences based on motifs and positional criteria, and processing sequence data through external functions.",
  "sources": "Sequence strings, positional data, and external functions with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "External functions which process or transform data; potential if malicious but behavior is unknown.",
  "flows": "Sequence data flows from input strings through motif detection and filtering, then to external processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy reliance on external functions with non-descriptive, obfuscated names; no direct malicious activity observed in the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard bioinformatics tasks such as motif searching, sequence slicing, and filtering based on biological features. The external functions' behavior cannot be verified, representing a potential risk. Obfuscation of variable and function names is common in scientific code but can also conceal malicious intent. No network, file, or credential handling is present. The logic appears legitimate, with no signs of malicious payloads or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical bioinformatics sequence analysis pipeline with obfuscated naming. While external dependencies are a concern, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score (0.2), moderate obfuscation score (0.4), and low security risk score (0.3) are consistent with this assessment. Continuous verification of external functions is recommended before deployment in sensitive environments.",
