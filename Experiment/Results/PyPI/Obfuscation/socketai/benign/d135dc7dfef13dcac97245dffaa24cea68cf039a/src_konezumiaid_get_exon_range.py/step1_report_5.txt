{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process genomic exon start and end positions, calculating intervals based on input data structured as a class instance with exon_start_positions and exon_end_positions attributes.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the attributes exon_start_positions and exon_end_positions of the passed object, which are iterated over in pairs.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; no data is sent over networks, written to files, or used insecurely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the object's exon start and end position attributes into calculations, resulting in a list of interval ranges.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable and function names, which could indicate an attempt to conceal functionality. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. No unsafe use of environment variables or data leaks are detected. The code performs straightforward calculations without external system interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific class from an obscure module and defines a function that processes two sequences of exon positions, calculating intervals. The use of obscure names suggests an attempt at obfuscation. Functionally, it computes ranges based on exon positions, which is typical in genomic data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The logic appears legitimate for data processing in bioinformatics workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but functionally straightforward, performing data processing on exon position data without any malicious indicators. Its obfuscation may be intended to hide purpose, but no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
