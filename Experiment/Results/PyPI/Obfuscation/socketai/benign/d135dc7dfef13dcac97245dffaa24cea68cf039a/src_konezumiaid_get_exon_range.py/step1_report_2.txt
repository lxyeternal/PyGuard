{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process genomic exon position data, calculating and storing coordinate ranges based on start and end positions.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from lEuHoenjQrMDWCCkqJcvEnzjDazzvoRU.exon_start_positions and lEuHoenjQrMDWCCkqJcvEnzjDazzvoRU.exon_end_positions.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems, files, or network resources. The code processes data internally without side effects.",
  "flows": "Inputs from exon_start_positions and exon_end_positions are used to compute ranges, which are stored in a list. No external data or system interactions are observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses heavily obfuscated variable and function names, which is unusual for clear, maintainable code. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The code relies on a specific data structure but contains no suspicious operations or obfuscation techniques beyond naming.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that processes genomic exon positions by iterating over start and end positions. It calculates the difference to determine exon length and stores coordinate ranges in a list. The obfuscated naming could be a sign of intent to hide functionality, but no malicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present. The code's logic is straightforward and related to data processing. There are no network connections, file I/O, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple calculation of genomic exon coordinate ranges with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to obscure the code's purpose rather than malicious intent.",
