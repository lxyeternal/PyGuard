  "purpose": "The code processes genomic exon positions to generate coordinate ranges, likely for further biological analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'lEuHoenjQrMDWCCkqJcvEnzjDazzvoRU' which is an object providing 'exon_start_positions' and 'exon_end_positions'.",
  "sinks": "The code appends coordinate ranges to a list but does not directly output or transmit data externally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input object's exon positions through calculations into a list of coordinate pairs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no clear or standard comments; the function performs coordinate calculations without obvious security implications. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or data structure from a module, then defines a function that processes two sequences of exon start and end positions. It iterates over these positions in pairs, calculates the length of each exon, and appends a list of coordinate ranges (start index and end index) based on cumulative exon lengths. The variable names are obfuscated, but the logic appears to be straightforward coordinate calculation. There are no external network calls, no use of environment variables, and no data leakage or injection vulnerabilities. The purpose seems to be genomic data processing. No suspicious behavior or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard coordinate calculations for genomic exons. It shows obfuscation through variable naming but no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger biological data analysis pipeline. No malware, data leakage, or sabotage indicators are present.",
