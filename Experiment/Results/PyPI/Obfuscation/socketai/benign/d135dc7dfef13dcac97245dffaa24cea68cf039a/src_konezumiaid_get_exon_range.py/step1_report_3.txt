  "purpose": "The code processes genomic exon start and end positions to generate coordinate ranges.",
  "sources": "Reads data from lEuHoenjQrMDWCCkqJcvEnzjDazzvoRU.exon_start_positions and lEuHoenjQrMDWCCkqJcvEnzjDazzvoRU.exon_end_positions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks are evident; the code does not write or transmit untrusted data outside internal variables.",
  "flows": "Iterates over exon start and end positions to compute and store coordinate ranges in a list.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are obfuscated, which may indicate an attempt to conceal intent; no explicit malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The function takes an object with exon position attributes and processes each pair to compute exon length ranges. It uses a loop with index accumulation, appending start and end indices for each exon. Variable names are nonsensical, but the logic appears to be straightforward data processing. No network operations, system commands, or data leaks are detected. The code's obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide its purpose, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple genomic coordinate calculations without any suspicious or malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable names could be a red flag, but the logic itself appears benign. No security risks or malware are evident.",
