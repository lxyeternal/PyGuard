  "purpose": "Calculates genomic exon coordinate ranges based on start and end positions, maintaining a cumulative index.",
  "sources": "exon_start_positions and exon_end_positions lists within the input object",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; function processes data internally without external output or network activity",
  "flows": "Iterates over paired start/end positions, computes exon length, updates cumulative index, appends coordinate range",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are heavily obfuscated; no external system calls or malicious patterns detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward genomic coordinate calculations, iterating over paired exon positions, computing exon lengths, and appending coordinate ranges based on a cumulative index. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or external interactions are present. Obfuscation is likely stylistic, not malicious. The logic is standard for bioinformatics data processing, and no vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple coordinate calculations with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malware or security risks are detected. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the code appears safe for use.",
