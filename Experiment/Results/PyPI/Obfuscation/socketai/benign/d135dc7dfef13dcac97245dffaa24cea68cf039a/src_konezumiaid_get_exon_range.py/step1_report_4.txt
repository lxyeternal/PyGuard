  "flows": "Read exon_start_positions and exon_end_positions, compute differences, and append coordinate ranges to list",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. The variable names are obfuscated, but the logic appears straightforward. No network activity, data leakage, or code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific data class and defines a function that takes an instance of this class as input. It initializes an empty list and a counter. It then zips together exon start and end positions, calculating interval lengths and appending coordinate pairs to the list, updating the counter accordingly. The operations are simple and do not involve external inputs, network communication, or sensitive data handling. The obfuscated variable names do not suggest malicious intent but reduce readability.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard computation of exon coordinate ranges based on start and end positions. There are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks within this fragment. The obfuscation appears to be a code style choice rather than malicious intent.",
