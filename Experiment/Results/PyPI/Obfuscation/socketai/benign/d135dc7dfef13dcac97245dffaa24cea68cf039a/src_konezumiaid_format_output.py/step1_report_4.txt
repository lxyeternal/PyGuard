{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions for processing gene and gRNA data, including filtering, data framing, and file management related to CRISPR gene editing.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters (lists of dicts, dataframes), reads from a static README file in the code directory.",
  "sinks": "Writes dataframes to CSV files, writes a copy of a README file into an output directory.",
  "flows": "Reads static README file -> creates output directory -> writes README copy -> outputs filtered dataframes to CSVs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. File I/O operations are straightforward. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data processing tasks such as filtering gene data based on exon count, intersecting primer sequences, and saving results to files. It uses standard libraries like pandas and pathlib. The file reading and writing are standard operations. There are no suspicious network activities, obfuscated segments, or malicious payloads. The static copying of a README file is benign and typical for data documentation. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present. Overall, the code appears to serve legitimate biological data analysis purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate, focused on data handling for gene editing analysis, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain sabotage, or malware. It performs expected file and data operations without suspicious activities.",
