{
  "purpose": "This code appears to facilitate the design and analysis of CRISPR gRNAs targeting specific genetic features, such as exons and splice sites, and to generate related data outputs.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters (lists of dicts, DataFrames), reading a markdown file ('DATAREADME.md') from the script directory, and environment-dependent paths.",
  "sinks": "Writing data to files within a designated output directory, printing gRNA lists and messages to stdout, and reading a markdown file.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and file reads into data processing functions; processed data is then written to files or printed. No evidence of untrusted input directly affecting system commands or sensitive data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code performs standard file handling, data filtering, and DataFrame manipulations typical for bioinformatics workflows. No unusual or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code includes functions for filtering and generating gRNA candidate lists based on exon counts and other criteria, and for outputting results. It reads a static markdown file for documentation or metadata purposes and writes output CSV files in a structured directory. The logic appears straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, network calls, or suspicious code patterns. Importantly, no hardcoded secrets, environmental manipulation, or malicious system commands are present. The code aligns with typical bioinformatics data processing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard bioinformatics data processing script for CRISPR gRNA design, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It handles input data, processes it, and outputs files without engaging in suspicious activities.",
