{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for filtering CRISPR guide RNA sequences based on exon counts and positional criteria, reading a static markdown file, and generating CSV outputs for candidate gRNAs and filtered sequences. It also manages file I/O for downstream analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameters include lists of dictionaries representing sequence data, and DataFrames for gRNA lists. The code reads a static README.md file from disk.",
  "sinks": "Writes CSV files with filtered gRNA data and copies README content into an output directory. No network activity or system commands are used.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input lists and DataFrames through filtering functions, culminating in CSV file outputs. Static README content is copied into the output directory.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or auto-generated, but this appears to be minimal obfuscation rather than malicious. No suspicious code patterns, secrets, or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard bioinformatics data filtering and file handling. It filters sequences based on exon count and positional flags, constructs DataFrames, and manages file I/O. No network calls, dynamic code execution, or credential handling are detected. Variable obfuscation is minimal and not indicative of malicious intent. The static README copying is benign. Overall, the code aligns with typical data processing pipelines in genetic research, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate bioinformatics utility for CRISPR guide RNA filtering and output generation. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and not malicious. The existing security and malware scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
