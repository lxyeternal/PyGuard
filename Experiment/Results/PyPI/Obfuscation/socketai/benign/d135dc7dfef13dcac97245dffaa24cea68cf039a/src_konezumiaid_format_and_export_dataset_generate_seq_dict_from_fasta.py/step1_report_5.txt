{
  "purpose": "The code reads FASTA files to extract sequences and processes a DataFrame of sequence names and strands, reversing sequences for negative strands using an imported function.",
  "sources": "Reading data from a file specified by 'path_fasta'; accessing DataFrame columns 'name' and 'strand'; importing from 'konezumiaid.get_reverse_complement'.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs processed sequence data into dictionaries; no direct data leaks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Reads sequences from file -> identifies sequence headers and sequences -> processes sequence names and strands -> applies reverse complement function for negative strands -> stores results in dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical but this is typical in obfuscated code; no suspicious network activity, hidden backdoors, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard bioinformatics processing: parsing FASTA files and manipulating sequence data based on strand orientation. It uses an imported reverse complement function, which appears legitimate. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is straightforward: sequence parsing, conditional reverse complement application, and output storage. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code does not contain obfuscation techniques like dynamic code execution or misleading logic; variable names are simply obfuscated. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are detected. Overall, the code appears to be standard biological data processing code without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs typical bioinformatics sequence parsing and processing. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but could hinder readability. The imported reverse complement function should be verified separately, but based on this code alone, no security issues are detected.",
