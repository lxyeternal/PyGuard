{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process FASTA files for nucleotide sequences and map sequence names to processed reverse complement sequences, likely for bioinformatics analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from a FASTA file specified by a file path.",
  "sinks": "Processes sequence data, possibly involving external functions, and returns a dictionary mapping sequence names to sequences.",
  "flows": "Reads sequence headers and sequences from the FASTA file, then uses an external function to generate reverse complements, which are then stored in a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "The imported function 'bKxxNsivaFcfBrjljFQWnOlxNmFUYITN' has an obfuscated name, which could be suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present. The code performs standard file parsing and sequence processing with no apparent malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a FASTA file line-by-line, storing sequence data associated with headers, then applies an external reverse complement function to sequence data depending on strand orientation. The variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic appears consistent with common bioinformatics tasks. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. The imported function's obfuscated name is suspicious but not necessarily malicious; it might be a legitimate reverse complement function. There are no evident security risks like code injection, hardcoded secrets, or malicious backdoors. The code performs typical file I/O and data processing steps, with no indication of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard sequence processing script with obfuscated naming, likely for bioinformatics workflows. No malicious or maliciously intended behavior is apparent. The obfuscation of the imported function could be suspicious, but based solely on this code, it appears benign.",
