{
  "purpose": "Processes FASTA files, extracts sequences, and applies reverse complement transformations based on strand information.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a FASTA file; calls external function 'bKxxNsivaFcfBrjljFQWnOlxNmFUYITN' from an obfuscated module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity detected; no data exfiltration or destructive actions evident.",
  "flows": "Reads sequence headers and sequences from file; calls external reverse complement function; stores processed sequences in a dictionary.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable and function names; external module with suspiciously obfuscated name; lack of input validation; no comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard FASTA parsing, sequence concatenation, and reverse complement application based on strand orientation. Obfuscation of names and external module source raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. No network or system-level malicious actions are present. The external function likely performs reverse complement, but its trustworthiness depends on source verification. The code's logic is consistent with typical bioinformatics workflows, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be typical bioinformatics sequence processing with obfuscated naming, which could be an attempt to conceal functionality but does not evidence malicious behavior. External dependencies should be verified for legitimacy. Overall, no malware or malicious activity is detected.",
