{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process genomic annotation data, likely for bioinformatics analysis, by reading files, filtering data, and transforming dataframes.",
  "sources": "File input via open() function, reading file contents; DataFrame columns such as 'exonStarts', 'exonEnds', 'chrom', 'name', 'txStart', 'txEnd', 'cdsStart', 'cdsEnd', 'strand'.",
  "sinks": "DataFrame operations involving string splitting, substring searching, and potential reassignments to columns; no direct network or system command execution.",
  "flows": "File reading -> Data parsing and conversion -> DataFrame filtering and transformation -> DataFrame modifications based on genomic coordinates and strand orientation.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'oqIhkYAVXaReBaYdGjjxwdZNldjmTSzl' reconstructs a DataFrame from file data without explicit validation; 'str.contains' uses regex patterns but no evident malicious pattern; 'split' on columns might be risky if input data is malformed, but not suspicious here. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious loops. The code structure and variable naming are obfuscated, but that alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code processes genomic data with functions for reading tab-separated files, filtering for unique entries, removing duplicates, and filtering based on chromosome labels. Functions handle coordinate adjustments for strand orientation and parsing exon start/end positions. The code lacks network operations, system calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms. Obfuscation in variable names is notable but not inherently malicious. Overall, the functions serve data processing purposes typical for bioinformatics pipelines, with no evident malicious intent or backdoors. No suspicious external behaviors, data leaks, or hidden payloads are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard genomic data processing script with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage mechanisms. The primary concern is code readability rather than security risk. Overall, it has low likelihood of malicious intent.",
