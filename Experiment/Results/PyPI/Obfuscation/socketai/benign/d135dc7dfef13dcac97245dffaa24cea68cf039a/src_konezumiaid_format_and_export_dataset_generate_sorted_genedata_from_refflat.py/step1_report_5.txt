{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process genomic data, involving reading files, filtering dataframes, and manipulating genomic coordinates and annotations.",
  "sources": "File input via open() function; DataFrame columns for 'chrom', 'exonStarts', 'exonEnds', 'name', 'txStart', 'txEnd', 'cdsStart', 'cdsEnd', 'strand', 'geneName'.",
  "sinks": "DataFrame manipulations that could modify coordinate data; no explicit data exfiltration, command execution, or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "File reading functions load data into memory; data is processed through multiple transformations and filtering steps within pandas DataFrames; no external data flows or network transmission present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code logic. The code does perform coordinate transformations that could be malicious if intended for data distortion or concealment, but nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code loads genomic data from a file, parses and structures it into pandas DataFrames, and applies various filters and coordinate adjustments. The functions perform standard genomic data manipulations such as filtering by chromosome, removing duplicates, adjusting coordinate frames, and reordering exon start/end positions. All operations are consistent with typical genomic data processing. No signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors, are detected. Variable naming is obfuscated but does not imply malicious intent. The data processing is straightforward and intended for data preparation or analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for genomic data manipulation with no evident malicious behavior. Its obfuscated variable names may hinder understanding but do not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the script appears to perform legitimate data processing tasks without security risks.",
