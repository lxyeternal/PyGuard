{
  "purpose": "The code reads genomic data files, parses tab-separated data into lists, converts them into DataFrames, and performs filtering and coordinate transformations typical in bioinformatics workflows.",
  "sources": "File input reading, pandas DataFrame operations, string manipulations for coordinate adjustments",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data exfiltration points are present; the code operates solely on local data",
  "flows": "Data is read from files, parsed into lists, converted into DataFrames, then filtered and transformed through various functions, with data flowing from input files through processing functions to output DataFrames",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; potential bug in handling pandas Series with string methods (e.g., .split() called directly on Series instead of using .str.split())",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard genomic data processing tasks, including deduplication, filtering by geneName and chromosome, coordinate adjustments based on strand orientation, and exon position recalculations. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal intent but does not introduce malicious behavior. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious payloads are evident. Minor potential bugs relate to pandas Series handling, but these do not suggest malicious intent. The malware scores are consistently zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), justified by the benign nature of the code. The high obfuscation score reflects the obscured variable names, but this alone does not imply malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate genomic data processing module with heavy obfuscation. No malicious activity, sabotage, or supply chain threats are detected. The obfuscation warrants attention but does not indicate malicious intent. The low malware and security risk scores are appropriate given the analysis.",
