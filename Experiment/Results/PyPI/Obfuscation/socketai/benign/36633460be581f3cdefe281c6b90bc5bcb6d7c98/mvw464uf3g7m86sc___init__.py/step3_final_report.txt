{
  "purpose": "Module setup importing components with obfuscated names and defining public API exports.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (.client, .paginator, optionally .service_resource).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements assign obfuscated modules to variables; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of module and variable names; fallback import pattern to 'builtins.object'.",
  "analysis": "The code performs module imports with obfuscated identifiers, uses a try-except fallback, and defines __all__ for exports. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution. Obfuscation may serve proprietary or concealment purposes but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The absence of network activity or data leaks supports a benign assessment. The obfuscation is significant but not unusual in proprietary SDKs, though it warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with obfuscated identifiers, likely for proprietary reasons. No signs of malware or malicious activity are present. The obfuscation is notable but does not imply malicious intent based on this snippet alone.",
