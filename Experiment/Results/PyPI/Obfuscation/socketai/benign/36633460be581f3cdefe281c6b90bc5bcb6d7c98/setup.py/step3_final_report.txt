  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file and passes static metadata to setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no external network calls, no malicious code execution",
  "flows": "Reads file content into variable, then calls setup() with static arguments",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, formatting irregularities, unusual variable naming conventions",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging, with obfuscated variable names and formatting anomalies. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly stylistic or placeholder, and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, assigning malware scores of 0. The obfuscation scores are justified by variable naming, ranging from 0.2 to 0.8. The overall security risk remains low (~0.2), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and the low risk score is appropriate.",
