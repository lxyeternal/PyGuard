  "purpose": "Assigning a string value '2.21.1' to a variable named 'QpIxiPRzUTaAGPyBERpeNjVNCtiJvMJm'",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; only assigns a static string to a variable",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where data flows to other functions or outputs",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simple assignment with no further processing",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated and nonsensical, which may be suspicious, but there is no active malicious behavior observed. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a variable with an obfuscated name and assigns it a static version string. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network activity, or other typical malicious indicators. The obfuscated variable name could be an attempt to hide intent, but in itself, it is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this fragment. The obfuscated name alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
