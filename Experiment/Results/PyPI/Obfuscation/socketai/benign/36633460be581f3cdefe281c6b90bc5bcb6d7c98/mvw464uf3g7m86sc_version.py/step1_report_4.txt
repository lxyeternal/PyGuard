  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely indicating a package or dependency version.",
  "sources": "The right-hand side string literal '2.21.1'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no data is sent, executed, or leaked.",
  "flows": "Variable assignment from a static string; no flow of untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears random and non-descriptive; no other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name and a version string. There are no input sources, data flows, or sink points. No code injection, malicious behavior, or obfuscation is evident. The variable name does not correlate with any standard or known pattern, but that alone is not malicious. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign assignment of a version string to a nonsensical variable name, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
