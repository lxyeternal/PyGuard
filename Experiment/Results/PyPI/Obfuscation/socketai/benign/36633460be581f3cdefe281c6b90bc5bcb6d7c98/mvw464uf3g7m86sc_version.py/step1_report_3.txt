  "purpose": "Assignment of a string value '2.21.1' to a variable that appears to be a version identifier.",
  "sources": "Assignment operation reading the string literal '2.21.1'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data is sent or processed in a way that leads to leakage or execution.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources; the variable is assigned a static string value.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears to be a random string; no meaningful or descriptive naming. No code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns a static version string to a variable named 'QpIxiPRzUTaAGPyBERpeNjVNCtiJvMJm'. There are no inputs, no external data sources, no functions, no network calls, or other operations. The variable name is nonsensical, which could be a form of obfuscation, but alone does not imply malicious intent. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code execution, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward variable assignment with a nonsensical variable name. There is no indication of malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
