{
  "purpose": "The code defines data structures and imports, primarily serving as type definitions for AWS SDK interactions without active logic or data processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from __future__, sys, typing, collections.abc, and literals module; class definitions with type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network calls, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No active data flow; only static type definitions and constants.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; imported literals from an external module which could conceal secrets but no evidence here.",
  "analysis": "The code is a collection of TypedDict classes and imports, serving as schemas or interfaces for AWS SDK components. No executable code, network activity, or secrets are visible. Obfuscation in naming is typical for auto-generated SDK code, not necessarily malicious. The absence of active logic or data transmission indicates a benign purpose. The imported literals' content is unknown but not suspicious in context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of data structure definitions for AWS interactions, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. Obfuscation is superficial and typical for SDK code. The overall security risk is minimal.",
