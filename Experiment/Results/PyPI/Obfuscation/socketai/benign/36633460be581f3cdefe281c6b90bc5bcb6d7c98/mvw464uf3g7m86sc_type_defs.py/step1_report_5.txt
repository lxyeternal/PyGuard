{
  "purpose": "The code defines various TypedDict classes and type annotations for AWS SDK interactions, primarily related to SQS, queue management, and message handling. It appears to set up data structures for a larger AWS SDK-based application.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys, typing, aiobotocore.response, and a local module .literals. These are sources for data reading, especially type information, external modules, and constants.",
  "sinks": "There are no explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or eval/exec functions. The code mostly defines data structures without performing any actions or data processing itself.",
  "flows": "No actual data flow or processing logic is present in the provided code. It is solely type and class definitions with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string constants imported from .literals could be suspicious if they are hardcoded secrets, but they are likely just constants. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors are evident. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of conditional imports based on Python version, and many TypedDict class definitions for structured data related to AWS SQS operations. No executable logic, network interactions, or sensitive data handling are visible. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The imports are standard, and the class definitions serve as data containers.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard setup for AWS SDK data structures using TypedDicts, with no evidence of malicious intent, malicious behaviors, or security risks. It is a benign component likely used for data validation and structure definition within a larger application.",
