{
  "purpose": "This code defines type annotations, data structures, and constants for interacting with AWS SQS and related services, likely as part of a larger SDK or application.",
  "sources": "Constants imported from '.literals'; data received from AWS SDK responses and user input; environment variables (implied by environment-dependent imports).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through logging or serialization; use of environment variables; network communication with AWS endpoints; handling of message attributes and metadata.",
  "flows": "Input data (from environment or user) flows into message attribute and queue configurations, then into network communication with AWS endpoints; response data flows back into the application, potentially revealing sensitive info.",
  "anomalies": "The code primarily consists of type definitions, constant imports, and structured data classes; no direct code execution, network calls, or suspicious code snippets are present. The imported literals may contain hidden secrets, but this cannot be confirmed from the provided fragment.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large collection of TypedDict classes and constants for AWS SQS interactions, with conditional imports based on Python version. No executable code, network operations, or dynamic code execution is included. The use of imported literals and the structure of the data suggest normal SDK-related data handling. No signs of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. There are no embedded network communications, file modifications, or obfuscated code segments. Overall, this appears to be a standard type definition module for an SDK or application interfacing with AWS SQS.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment appears to be a legitimate, non-malicious type and data structure definition for AWS SQS SDK interactions. It does not contain any malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. The use of imported literals and extensive type annotations is typical for SDKs and does not suggest malicious intent.",
