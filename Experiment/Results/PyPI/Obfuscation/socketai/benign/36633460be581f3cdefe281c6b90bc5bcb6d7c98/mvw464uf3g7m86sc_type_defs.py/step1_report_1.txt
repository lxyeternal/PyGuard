{
  "purpose": "The code defines various TypedDict classes and imports, likely to be used in an AWS SDK or message queue context, with no apparent malicious intent or active logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data only from import statements, type annotations, and type definitions. No input/output or data reading functions are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or places where untrusted data is processed or transmitted, such as network calls, file writes, or command executions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code solely defines data structures without executing any data processing or transfer.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes many obfuscated or non-descriptive variable and class names, which could suggest attempts at hiding malicious intent, but these are solely type definitions and imports. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. Import statements include third-party modules but do not invoke malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of conditional imports based on Python version, extensive type definitions using TypedDict, and some constants. It appears to serve as a data schema or interface layer, possibly for AWS SQS or SNS interactions. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation of variable names might raise suspicion, but given the absence of executable logic, no malicious activity can be identified. No network activity, command execution, or secret management is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a collection of data structure definitions and imports, with no executable logic or active data processing. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated naming could be intended for code hiding but does not indicate malicious intent in isolation.",
