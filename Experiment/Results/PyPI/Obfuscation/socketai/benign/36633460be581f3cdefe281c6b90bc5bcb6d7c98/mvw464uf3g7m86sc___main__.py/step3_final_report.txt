  "purpose": "Outputs package information and version details for a CLI utility script.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), outputs static strings to stdout.",
  "sinks": "Writes to stdout; no untrusted data sinks or external network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Command-line input triggers either version info or package details output; static data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Function names are obfuscated or non-descriptive, but serve simple output purposes; no malicious anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: one outputs package info and documentation links, another outputs version number, and the main function checks for '--version' in command-line args to decide which to call. The script is straightforward, with no external calls, dynamic code execution, or data leaks. The obfuscated function names are superficial and do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.2-0.8, risk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with the benign, informational nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for displaying package info and version details. Despite non-descriptive function names, there is no malicious activity or security risk. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The overall security assessment should be malware=0, obfuscated=0.4, risk=0.1, reflecting its benign, informational purpose.",
