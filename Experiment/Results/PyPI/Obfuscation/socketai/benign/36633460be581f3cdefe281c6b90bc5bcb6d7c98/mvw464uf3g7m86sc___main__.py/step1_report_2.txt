{
  "purpose": "The script outputs version information and documentation links related to aiobotocore SQS 2.21.1, serving as an informational utility or documentation helper.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via sys.argv and outputs text to sys.stdout.",
  "sinks": "Writes to standard output (sys.stdout), which is benign. No external data sources or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "User input (command-line arguments) influences program flow; output is sent to stdout. No data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The function names are non-descriptive and obfuscated-looking, but they do not perform malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: two for printing version and documentation info, and one main function that checks for a '--version' argument to decide which info to print. All operations are straightforward, mainly outputting static strings. There are no external calls, no data manipulation, no network activity, and no execution of untrusted code. The structure is simple and conventional for a command-line utility.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign informational utility that displays version and documentation details about aiobotocore SQS. It contains no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
