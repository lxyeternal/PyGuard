{
  "purpose": "The script outputs information about aiobotocore SQS package details and version when run with or without command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv; writes to stdout via sys.stdout.write.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to stdout; no other sinks or external data transmission identified.",
  "flows": "If '--version' argument is provided, calls tiiQJZFTEmxnflDkXhflFxdVQErqCUZH() to output version info; otherwise, calls UQVLwMnLaEwGnRNmEFutHLVoWbtkDJBX() to output package details.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs observed. The functions are named with obfuscated-like identifiers but serve straightforward output purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions, with two primarily for outputting package information or version number. The main function checks for a '--version' argument and calls the appropriate function. The code is simple and primarily for informational output. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious code structures. The naming of functions appears obfuscated but does not correlate with malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign, designed to provide package info and version output based on command-line input. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
