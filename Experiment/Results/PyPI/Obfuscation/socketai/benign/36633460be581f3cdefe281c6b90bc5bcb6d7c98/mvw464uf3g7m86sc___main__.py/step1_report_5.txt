{
  "purpose": "The script appears to be a simple utility that outputs version information about a specific library or package related to 'aiobotocore' and 'boto3' for AWS SQS, likely for informational or diagnostic purposes.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (reads command-line arguments), sys.stdout.write (outputs data)",
  "sinks": "sys.stdout.write (outputs version info), reads sys.argv for '--version' argument",
  "flows": "If '--version' is present in command-line args, calls tiiQJZFTEmxnflDkXhflFxdVQErqCUZH to output version; otherwise, calls UQVLwMnLaEwGnRNmEFutHLVoWbtkDJBX to output detailed info",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated logic or hidden backdoors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines three functions: two for outputting static version info strings, and one that conditionally outputs either version info or detailed package info based on command-line arguments. The code performs straightforward input reading and output without any user input processing or network activity. There are no indications of malicious activity, suspicious data handling, or obfuscated logic. The code seems intended for informational purposes, with no signs of sabotage or malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is benign and serves to display version information about specific AWS SDK-related packages. There are no malicious behaviors, data leaks, or security risks detected. The code appears straightforward and safe.",
