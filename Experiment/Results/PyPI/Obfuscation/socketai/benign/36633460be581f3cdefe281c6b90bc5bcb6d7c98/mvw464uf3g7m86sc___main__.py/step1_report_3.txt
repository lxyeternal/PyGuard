{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that outputs version information and documentation URLs related to the 'aiobotocore' and 'boto3' libraries, likely for informational or debugging purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments (sys.argv), reads from standard output (sys.stdout.write).",
  "sinks": "Outputs to standard output (sys.stdout.write).",
  "flows": "Command-line argument check (input) -> conditional branch -> version info output (stdout).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. The code is straightforward, mainly printing static information. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The script checks for '--version' in sys.argv and prints version information if present; otherwise, it prints static documentation URLs and version details. No external data sources or network connections are made. The code is minimal, with no indication of malicious intent or suspicious activity. It functions solely as an informational utility.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and serves to display version and documentation info for specific Python packages. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
