  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality & Behavior:**\n   - The script defines three functions:\n     - One outputs static package info and documentation links.\n     - One outputs the version number.\n     - The main function checks for `--version` in `sys.argv`:\n       - If present, calls the version function.\n       - Otherwise, outputs package info.\n   - The code is straightforward, primarily for informational output.\n   - No external network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic code execution is present.\n   - The function names are obfuscated or non-descriptive but serve simple print tasks.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior:**\n   - The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign.\n   - No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are observed.\n   - No obfuscated code is malicious; the obfuscation appears superficial.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - **Malware Score:**\n     - All reports assign `0` or very close to zero.\n     - The code does not perform any malicious activity.\n     - **Recommendation:** Keep at 0, as no malware is present.\n   \n   - **Obfuscated Score:**\n     - Ranges from 0.2 to 0.8.\n     - The function names are obfuscated or nonsensical, but this does not imply malicious intent.\n     - The obfuscation is superficial, likely for style or to avoid easy reading.\n     - **Recommendation:** A score around 0.2–0.3 is reasonable, indicating superficial obfuscation without malicious intent.\n   \n   - **Risk Score:**\n     - Very low (0.1 to 0.2).\n     - The script is purely informational with no security risk.\n     - **Recommendation:** Keep at 0.1–0.2, as it poses no real security threat.\n\n4. **Potential Issues or Assumptions:**\n   - The reports do not claim any vulnerabilities or exploits.\n   - The obfuscation is superficial and not malicious.\n   - No dynamic or external code execution occurs.\n   - The code could be part of a larger package or utility, but on its own, it’s benign.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The code is a simple CLI utility for displaying package info.\n   - No malicious activity, data leaks, or vulnerabilities are evident.\n   - The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.2–0.3 (consistent with superficial obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal security risk)\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThe code appears safe, benign, and intended solely for informational purposes. The obfuscation seems superficial and not malicious.",
