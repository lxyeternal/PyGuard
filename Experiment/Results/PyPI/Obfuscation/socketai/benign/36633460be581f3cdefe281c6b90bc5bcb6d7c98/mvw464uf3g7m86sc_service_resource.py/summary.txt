  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated SDK wrapper for AWS SQS with no explicit malicious activity detected. The main concern is the obfuscation, which could conceal malicious payloads, but current analysis shows no evidence of malware. Scores are set to reflect low malware probability with high obfuscation and moderate risk due to potential misuse."
