{
  "purpose": "Define and export various string literal types for AWS service identifiers and configuration options, ensuring compatibility with different Python versions.",
  "sources": "Reading the Python version info from sys and importing typing.Literal or typing_extensions.Literal based on the version.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports version info, then defines and exports type literals; there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code are present. The variable names are obfuscated but consistent with auto-generated or intentionally obscure naming, which is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally imports 'Literal' based on Python version, then declares a series of constants as 'Literal' types with predefined string options, primarily related to AWS services and configurations. The variables are assigned very long, seemingly random or obfuscated names, but their values are simple string literals. No user input, network activity, or data processing occurs. The code appears to be purely defining constants for type hints or API configurations, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of type definitions and constant declarations for AWS-related identifiers. It shows no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscated variable names may suggest automated code generation but do not pose a security threat.",
