{
  "purpose": "Defines type literals and constants for AWS SDK-related identifiers and configurations, likely for use in a larger project.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module; conditional import from typing or typing_extensions; defining constants and type literals.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted input to critical operations or external communications.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains many obfuscated variable names that seem auto-generated or deliberately confusing; no apparent malicious logic or backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or credentials found. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or file manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily sets up type annotations and constants, with conditional imports based on Python version. The variable names are obscure, which could suggest obfuscation, but they only serve as identifiers for string literals and type annotations. There is no code that reads external input, performs network calls, writes files, or manipulates system resources. No suspicious code patterns or malicious behaviors are evident. The overall structure indicates a type-definitions module for AWS SDK or API usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module defining type annotations and constants for AWS service identifiers. It shows signs of obfuscation in variable naming but lacks any malicious behavior or security risks. No indicators of supply chain attack or malware are present.",
