  "purpose": "Define type literals and module exports for AWS-related constants and configurations, ensuring compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statement for sys module, version info check, and definitions of string literals for various AWS resource names and regions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network or file I/O, no use of untrusted input data, environment variables, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code solely establishes constants and type annotations without any runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. Usage of Literal types is standard for type hints.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up type annotations using Literal for AWS resource names and regions, with conditional import for typing.Literal based on Python version. No input handling, network operations, or credential management observed. The purpose appears to be providing type safety and clarity within a larger project. No signs of obfuscated code or malicious behavior. The code structure is straightforward and conventional for type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a collection of type hints and constants for AWS resource identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malicious payload, or security risks present in this fragment.",
