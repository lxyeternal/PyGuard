  "purpose": "Define string literal types and constants for AWS resource identifiers, regions, and service names, with version compatibility handling.",
  "sources": "Static definitions of string literals and type aliases, no external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type and constant definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, likely auto-generated; no malicious code or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static type aliases and constants for AWS services, regions, and resource identifiers. Variable names are obfuscated but consistent with auto-generated code. No dynamic behavior, input/output, network activity, or secrets are present. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent; it may be for code organization or obfuscation. No evidence of backdoors, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk) are appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, obfuscated set of type definitions and constants for AWS SDKs, with no malicious or security issues. The obfuscation is likely due to code generation, not malicious intent. The malware score of 0 and low security risk scores are justified and appropriate.",
