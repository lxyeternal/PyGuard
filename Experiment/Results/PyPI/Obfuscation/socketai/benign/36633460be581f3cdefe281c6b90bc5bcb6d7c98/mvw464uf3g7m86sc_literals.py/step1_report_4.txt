  "purpose": "Define type literals and constants for AWS-related configuration and naming conventions to be used across a Python project.",
  "sources": "Importing sys module and conditional import of Literal from typing or typing_extensions; defining multiple string literal variables with constant values.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks, system compromise, or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious activity; all variables are static literals or type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or dynamic execution. Variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated but are consistent with obfuscation or code obfuscation techniques; no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily imports modules, conditionally imports type definitions, and then declares a large number of string literals with AWS service names, resource types, regions, and other constants. There are no functions, network calls, file I/O, or dynamic code execution. The variable names appear random or obfuscated, but they are static string constants. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, malicious network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The overall structure suggests configuration or code obfuscation but not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve as a configuration or obfuscation layer defining constants and type literals for AWS services and regions. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names may indicate an attempt to hide intent or to prevent easy analysis, but no malicious activity is detected.",
