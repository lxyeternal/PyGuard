{
  "purpose": "Defines AWS SDK paginator classes with obfuscated names for use in asynchronous operations.",
  "sources": "Class inheritance, import statements, conditional imports based on Python version.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or external data processing observed.",
  "flows": "Class definitions and method signatures with dynamic kwargs, no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation of class and method names, use of dynamic unpacking, conditional imports for version compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code is a boilerplate setup for AWS SDK pagination, utilizing obfuscated identifiers to conceal internal logic. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. The obfuscation appears to serve as a means of hiding implementation details rather than malicious intent. The absence of hardcoded secrets, network calls, or data leaks supports a benign interpretation. The code's structure aligns with standard SDK wrapper patterns, with obfuscation being the primary concern for maintainability rather than security.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated SDK utility for AWS pagination with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal internal details but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk score remains low, consistent with the analysis.",
