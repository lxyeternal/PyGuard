{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up a Python package, with functions to read a description and requirements, and then calling setup() to configure the package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files; input data from external files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or insecure data handling observed; setup parameters are static and controlled.",
  "flows": "Read from external files (sources) used to populate package metadata; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Functions are named with random, obfuscated names; no actual malicious behavior found. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code features.",
  "analysis": "The script reads description and requirements from files, then calls setup() with package metadata. No network activity, code injection, or dynamic execution present. The obfuscated function names may indicate code hiding, but they do not perform malicious actions. The code appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated function names, likely to deter casual inspection, but no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with obfuscated function names. No malicious or suspicious behavior observed. It appears to be a normal package configuration file with no security risks.",
