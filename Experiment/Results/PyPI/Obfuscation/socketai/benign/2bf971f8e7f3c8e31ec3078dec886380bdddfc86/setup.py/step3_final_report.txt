{
  "purpose": "A Python package setup script that reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' to configure package metadata, with obfuscated function and parameter names.",
  "sources": "Reads from local files 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' to supply data for setup configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, external network activity, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "flows": "File contents are read and passed directly into setup parameters; no external data flows or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names and parameter keys; no malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated identifiers, which may be for concealment but does not exhibit malicious activity. No network activity, code injection, or credential handling is present. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not inherently malicious. The code's logic is straightforward, and the absence of dynamic or external malicious behaviors indicates benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, obfuscated setup configuration with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely for proprietary or concealment purposes but does not constitute a security threat.",
