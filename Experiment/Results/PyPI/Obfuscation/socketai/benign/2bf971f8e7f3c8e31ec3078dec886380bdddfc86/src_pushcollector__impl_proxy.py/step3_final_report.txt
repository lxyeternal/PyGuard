  "sinks": "Delegated method outputs, schema validation steps, data transformations.",
  "flows": "Schema file loading -> data validation -> delegation -> method calls with processed data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, dynamic path and method calls, use of 'os.XbkfeBBmGTDzzgUSJqzblRTGCEIKzAQv' instead of 'os.path'.",
  "analysis": "The code loads schemas from disk, validates data with jsonschema, and delegates further processing. Obfuscated naming and dynamic method calls suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but no network activity, system modifications, or credential handling are evident. The obfuscation could be malicious concealment or just code protection. The validation logic appears standard, and no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system compromise is detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0.1-0.2, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.2) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a schema validation wrapper with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring, especially if external inputs or delegate objects are untrusted.",
