Further review of the actual implementation and usage of the imported object is recommended to determine if malicious behavior exists."

No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the associated module and usage context to rule out malicious intent."

The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring, especially if external inputs or delegate objects are untrusted."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a registry management system with obfuscated identifiers and dynamic class instantiation, which introduces moderate security risks. While no active malicious actions are evident, the design allows for potential exploitation if malicious classes are registered. The high obfuscation and dynamic behavior justify a cautious security posture, and further analysis of registered classes and runtime behavior is recommended."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their observations; high obfuscation and suspicious patterns justify higher scores where applicable. The primary concern is with reports indicating obfuscation and eval/exec, warranting a malware score around 0.5. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence, with minor adjustments to better reflect suspicion levels."
