  "purpose": "Assess the suspicious import of an obfuscated object from an internal module, evaluating potential malicious intent or security risks.",
  "sources": "The import statement: 'from pushcollector._impl import SoPhNCtWPRibITYiQQkqbLdrdAXsiaov'. No additional data sources are provided.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in the code snippet; potential concern is the imported object which could be used maliciously downstream.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink flows are observable; the concern is the imported obfuscated object which may be used later in the code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, nonsensical name for an imported object; import from an internal module (_impl). The pattern suggests obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing an obfuscated identifier from an internal module, which is suspicious. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) is justified due to the nonsensical name. Malware likelihood remains low (~0.2-0.3) as no malicious activity is evident from this line alone. The security risk score (~0.4) reflects moderate concern due to obfuscation and internal module access. The pattern warrants further investigation into the implementation of the imported object and its usage in the broader codebase. The scores are consistent with the suspicion level, and no adjustments are necessary at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement's obfuscated nature and internal module origin raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious activity. The scores appropriately reflect high obfuscation, low malware probability, and moderate security risk. Further review of the actual implementation and usage of the imported object is recommended to determine if malicious behavior exists.",
