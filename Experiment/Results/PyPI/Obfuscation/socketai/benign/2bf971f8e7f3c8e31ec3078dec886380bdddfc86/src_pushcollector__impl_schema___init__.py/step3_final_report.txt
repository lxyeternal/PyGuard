  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external data, and code execution points such as eval/exec.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file operations, system commands, and environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment/user input through processing functions to sinks such as network or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code, eval/exec usage, misleading variable names, structural ambiguity, minimal or absent code, dynamic code execution suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with suspicious patterns like eval/exec and misleading variable names. In absence of explicit code, suspicion is based on structural anomalies and obfuscation indicators. Scores reflect high obfuscation (0.8-0.7) where present, moderate malware suspicion (0.4-0.3), and elevated security risk (0.75-0.5) aligned with potential malicious techniques. Benign assessments are justified by lack of code or suspicious patterns. Slight score adjustments are considered to better reflect the suspicion levels, especially for reports with obfuscation and eval/exec usage.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports are consistent with their observations; high obfuscation and suspicious patterns justify higher scores where applicable. The primary concern is with reports indicating obfuscation and eval/exec, warranting a malware score around 0.5. Overall, the scoring aligns with the evidence, with minor adjustments to better reflect suspicion levels.",
