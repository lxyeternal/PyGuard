      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with an anomalous, obfuscated parameter that raises suspicion. While no malicious activity is evident, the presence of such a parameter warrants further inspection of the package for hidden secrets or malicious payloads. The risk is moderate, and the obfuscation suggests caution."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated state machine implementation with no direct malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain low, around 0.1-0.2, considering the absence of malicious payloads. The main concern is potential misuse if callbacks are maliciously supplied, but the code itself does not contain malicious behavior."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated data processing library performing standard binary parsing, validation, and compression routines. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could conceal malicious intent, but based on this fragment alone, it appears legitimate. The malware score should remain low, and the overall security risk is minimal, with obfuscation being the main red flag."

      "conclusion": "The import statements with obfuscated identifiers do not demonstrate malicious activity or security vulnerabilities in this snippet. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but no malware is evident. The overall security risk remains low. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their safety."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated multiprocessing framework with no concrete evidence of malicious activity. However, its structure and naming obscure intent, which could be exploited if misused. The malware score is low, but the obfuscation and potential for covert behavior justify a moderate security risk assessment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex bioinformatics utility for managing compressed genomic indices. While heavily obfuscated, there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or sabotage. The low malware score (0.2) and moderate security risk (0.4) reflect the obfuscation concern but are justified given the lack of malicious indicators."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated VCF parser with no evidence of malware or malicious activity based on static analysis. The main concern is the obfuscation, which could hide malicious intent, but current evidence suggests a low security threat. Further dynamic analysis could be considered if runtime behavior is a concern."
