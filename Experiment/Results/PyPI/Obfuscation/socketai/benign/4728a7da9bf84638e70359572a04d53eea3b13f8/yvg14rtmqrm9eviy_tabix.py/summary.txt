  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex bioinformatics utility for managing compressed genomic indices. While heavily obfuscated, there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data theft, or sabotage. The low malware score (0.2) and moderate security risk (0.4) reflect the obfuscation concern but are justified given the lack of malicious indicators."
