{
  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, specifying metadata, package data, and development dependencies.",
  "sources": "The input parameters to the 'setup' function, including the string assignments and the package_data dictionary.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if any input data were untrusted, they could influence package metadata or dependencies; however, all data appears hardcoded.",
  "flows": "The hardcoded 'wtHNPhYjMRiguFFaJHQkzyHoFSQCztPF' value could be misused if dynamically altered, but as written, there are no data flows involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly random string assigned to 'wtHNPhYjMRiguFFaJHQkzyHoFSQCztPF', which could be obfuscated or serve as a hidden credential or identifier. No other suspicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setuptools setup invocation with parameters to define package metadata. The unusual string 'wtHNPhYjMRiguFFaJHQkzyHoFSQCztPF' appears as a key-value pair, but it is not used elsewhere, indicating it might be a placeholder, obfuscation, or malicious artifact. All other data are static and typical for setup scripts. No code injection, network calls, or dynamic behaviors are present. The overall structure is consistent with legitimate packaging scripts, but the presence of an obscure string warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with an unusual hardcoded string that could be obfuscation or a secret. There is no clear malicious behavior, but the suspicious string should be investigated further to confirm its purpose. Overall, no active malware or malicious activity is evident.",
