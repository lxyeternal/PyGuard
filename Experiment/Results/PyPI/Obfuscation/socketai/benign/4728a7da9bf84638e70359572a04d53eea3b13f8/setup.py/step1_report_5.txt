  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; standard setup parameters.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a suspicious parameter name 'wtHNPhYjMRiguFFaJHQkzyHoFSQCztPF' assigned a string value, which appears to be random or obfuscated; no clear explanation for this parameter.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with multiple arguments. Most parameters are typical for package setup, such as version, package_data, long_description_content_type, and extras_require. However, there is a parameter 'wtHNPhYjMRiguFFaJHQkzyHoFSQCztPF' with a seemingly random string as a key, assigned a string that looks like a random token. This is unusual and potentially suspicious, as it could be used as a hidden backdoor, secret key, or malicious payload. The rest of the code appears normal and standard for a setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears primarily standard for a Python setup script, but the inclusion of an obfuscated or suspiciously named parameter suggests potential malicious intent or covert behavior. Without additional context, this parameter is a red flag and warrants further investigation.",
