{
  "purpose": "The function appears to be a part of a validation framework that inspects the call stack to retrieve context and validate parameters passed to validator functions.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the call stack using inspect.stack(), and from local variables 'self' and specific attributes within the call context.",
  "sinks": "The code accesses local variables and attributes, performs assertions and raises exceptions, and manipulates data within the function. No direct data leaks or dangerous sinks are identified.",
  "flows": "The call stack is inspected to identify calling functions, local 'self' object is retrieved and validated, parameter names are checked against a dictionary, and finally, a value from the dictionary is returned.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.stack() to analyze call context is unusual in standard application code; reliance on internal call stack details can be risky if misused. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected. No external data sources or untrusted input handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects the call stack to identify if the current function is invoked within specific validator functions. It retrieves the 'self' object from the frame's local variables and verifies its type. It accesses an attribute chain within 'self' and asserts its presence. Then, it checks whether the provided parameter name exists within a dictionary, returning associated values. The use of inspect.stack() can be considered risky if misused but is not inherently malicious. The code does not perform network operations, file access, or data exfiltration. It appears to be a controlled internal utility for validation context management.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a validation utility that inspects the call stack to retrieve context and ensure proper invocation. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are detected. The use of call stack inspection is somewhat unusual but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the code appears safe and aligned with internal validation logic.",
