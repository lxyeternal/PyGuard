  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate internal validation utility that uses call stack inspection to access contextual data. There is no evidence of malicious activity, supply chain sabotage, or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the obfuscation score can be slightly lowered, but overall, the code appears benign and intended for internal validation purposes."
