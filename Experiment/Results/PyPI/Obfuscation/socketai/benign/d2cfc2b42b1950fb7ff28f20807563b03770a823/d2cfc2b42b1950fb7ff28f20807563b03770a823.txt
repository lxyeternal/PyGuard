The high obfuscation score is justified due to naming and placeholder variables, but malware and security risk scores are appropriate at zero and low, respectively. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern rather than malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware scores. The current low malware and risk scores are justified, with obfuscation appropriately marked high. Further analysis of the imported modules' content would be necessary for a definitive security assessment."

The high obfuscation is likely for concealment or intellectual property reasons, but it does not suggest malicious activity. The scores assigned in the reports are justified and consistent with the detailed analysis."

While its heavy obfuscation and complexity warrant caution, there is no direct evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration. The risk is moderate primarily due to obfuscation, but the overall assessment indicates no active malicious behavior at this time."

There is no evidence of malicious activity, supply chain sabotage, or malware. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; the obfuscation score can be slightly lowered, but overall, the code appears benign and intended for internal validation purposes."

No evidence of malware or sabotage is found. The overall security risk is low, and the code can be considered safe for use."
