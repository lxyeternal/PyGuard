  "purpose": "Importing specific functions and classes from internal modules for use within the package",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: analysis, execution, mapped_validators, validator",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external outputs present; purely static import statements",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; imports are static references within the package",
  "anomalies": "Unusually obfuscated function and class names that appear random and nonsensical, suggesting code obfuscation or code generation",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with function and class names that appear random or nonsensical. No input handling, network operations, or data processing is visible. The naming patterns resemble obfuscated or auto-generated identifiers, which could be intended to conceal malicious behavior or complicate analysis. Since these are internal imports, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration or system compromise. However, the obfuscated identifiers raise suspicion about potential concealment of malicious functions or backdoors within these modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated, which could be benign or malicious. There are no explicit malicious behaviors evident from these import statements alone, but the naming patterns warrant caution. Without access to the imported modules' content, a definitive malicious assessment cannot be made. Overall, the risk is moderate due to obfuscation.",
