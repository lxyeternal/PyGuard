  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of import statements from internal modules with obfuscated names in a Python package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules with nonsensical or obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, network activity, or execution of code; only static import statements.",
  "flows": "None, as the code only contains import statements without execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated module and variable names, which could be intended to conceal malicious code or be benign auto-generated code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules with obfuscated names. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or insecure practices is visible. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive of malicious intent. The scores from reports are generally conservative, with malware scores at 0.2 or 0, obfuscation scores high (~0.8), and risk scores low (~0.2-0.3). Given the lack of active malicious indicators, the current scoring aligns with the evidence. Slight adjustments could be made to reflect the cautious suspicion due to obfuscation, but overall, the assessments are consistent and appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware scores. The current low malware and risk scores are justified, with obfuscation appropriately marked high. Further analysis of the imported modules' content would be necessary for a definitive security assessment.",
