  "purpose": "Importing specific functions or classes from internal modules for use within the package",

  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; import statements are static and do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "Use of seemingly random, non-descriptive function and class names; no documentation or comments; no visible malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules with obfuscated, non-descriptive identifiers. There is no evidence of data processing, network activity, or execution of malicious code. The naming scheme could be suspicious if it were dynamic or involved external inputs, but here, it appears to be static internal references. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code does not perform any actions beyond importing symbols.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard set of import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks based on this snippet. The unusual naming may be an obfuscation tactic or just non-descriptive naming, but it does not in itself indicate malicious intent.",
