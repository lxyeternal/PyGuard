  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware scores. The current low malware and risk scores are justified, with obfuscation appropriately marked high. Further analysis of the imported modules' content would be necessary for a definitive security assessment."
