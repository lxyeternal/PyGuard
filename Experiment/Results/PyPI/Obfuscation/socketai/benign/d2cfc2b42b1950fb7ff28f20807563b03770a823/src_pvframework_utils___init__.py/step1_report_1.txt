{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions and classes from local modules, likely to be used elsewhere in the larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .frame_functions and .query_object.",
  "sinks": "No immediate data sinks or untrusted data handling identified; import statements generally do not process data directly.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from the provided code snippet alone, as it only contains imports without further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers (dmcCyfpcZoTLFecPFZihMUzJGVdHMJic, eQyuyEdmrYSdUxjKBkzPNffRuhmWMdrr, yZqGThDLVFyWdsfNCGSoVnDhRqGIjTXf) are obfuscated or randomly named, which is suspicious but not definitive evidence of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply poor naming. No executable logic, data handling, or network activity is present. Obfuscated identifiers warrant further review in context, but these alone do not confirm malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited snippet, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The use of obfuscated names raises suspicion, but without additional context or code, it cannot be conclusively malicious. The code appears to be a standard import pattern with suspicious naming conventions.",
