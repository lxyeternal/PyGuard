{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules, likely for internal use within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .frame_functions and .query_object",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external data flow observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and internal",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are obfuscated or nonsensical, possibly generated or intentionally obscure; no actual code execution, data handling, or suspicious operations shown",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from local modules, referencing seemingly obfuscated or randomly named functions/classes. There are no other operations, data processing, or network communications. The obfuscated names could suggest code concealment but are not inherently malicious. Without further code, no suspicious behavior or malware is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard module imports, potentially obfuscated but not malicious.",
