{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions or variables from local modules within a package, likely for internal use.",
  "sources": "Imports from .frame_functions and .query_object modules, specifically functions or variables with seemingly random or obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or potentially dangerous functions are visible.",
  "flows": "No execution or data flow is evident in the snippet; it's purely import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names look obfuscated or randomly generated, which can sometimes be a sign of malicious intent or code obfuscation. No other anomalies such as hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from local modules, with function or variable names that appear to be obfuscated or auto-generated. There are no visible data inputs, outputs, or behavior beyond importing. This pattern is common in modular codebases, but the obscure naming warrants attention as a potential sign of obfuscation. No malicious code, network activity, or suspicious logic is apparent in these lines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with obfuscated names, which on its own does not indicate malicious behavior. It could be part of a larger codebase where these imports are used legitimately. There is no evidence of malware or security risks in this snippet.",
