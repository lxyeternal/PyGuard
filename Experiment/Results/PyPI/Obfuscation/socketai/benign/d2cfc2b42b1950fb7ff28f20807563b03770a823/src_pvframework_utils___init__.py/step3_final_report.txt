  "purpose": "Import functions/classes from local modules with obfuscated or nonsensical names, possibly for code protection or auto-generation.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.frame_functions' and '.query_object' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data sources present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution beyond import statements; no source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and identifier names; no executable logic or data processing present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The lack of executable code, data flow, or network activity indicates no immediate threat. The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but are justified given the naming. Malware scores are zero, aligning with the absence of evidence for malicious intent. Risk scores are low, consistent with the minimal code and lack of suspicious behavior. The reports correctly avoid assuming maliciousness solely based on obfuscation and recognize that such naming can be benign or for code protection.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet appears benign, with obfuscated names possibly used for code protection or auto-generation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or high security risk. Further context and analysis of the usage of these imported identifiers are necessary for a definitive assessment, but based solely on this code, it is safe to consider it low risk.",
