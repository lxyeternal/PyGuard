  "purpose": "Import specific functions and classes from local modules within a package, likely for internal use in the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .frame_functions and .query_object",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks identified; no data output or external connections shown",
  "flows": "No data flows are visible; only imports of functions and classes without usage context",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear as random or obfuscated names, which could be suspicious; however, this is common in obfuscated or minified code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code patterns are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, importing functions and classes with seemingly obfuscated or nonsensical names. There are no direct code executions, data handling, or network operations shown. The obfuscated names could be a red flag, but they are not inherently malicious; they might be intentionally obfuscated. Without additional context or usage, there is no clear evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided import statements, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The obfuscated naming raises some suspicion but is not definitive. No security risks or malware signals are evident from this snippet.",
