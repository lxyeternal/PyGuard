  "purpose": "Import functions and classes from local modules for further use in the project.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .frame_functions and .query_object",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output statements",
  "flows": "No data flows observable; only static imports are shown",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions with seemingly random or obfuscated identifiers for functions and classes, which could indicate obfuscation or code hiding techniques. No other suspicious code or behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of import statements from local modules with functions and classes that have non-descriptive, potentially obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The code is minimal, focusing solely on imports, and does not include any runtime logic or data handling that could be malicious. The naming style may be a result of code obfuscation or automated generation, but no malicious intent can be inferred solely from these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which alone do not indicate malicious behavior. There is no evidence of malware or security risks in the provided fragment. The suspiciousness of the naming warrants caution, but based solely on these lines, the code does not seem malicious.",
