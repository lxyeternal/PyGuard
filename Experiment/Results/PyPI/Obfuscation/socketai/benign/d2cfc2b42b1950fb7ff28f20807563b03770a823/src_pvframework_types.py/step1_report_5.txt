  "purpose": "Define type aliases and protocols for validators related to a data set, with conditional imports for type checking.",
  "sources": "Type hints, imports, and class/variable definitions within the module.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks where untrusted data is processed or sent to external systems.",
  "flows": "Type alias definitions and protocol declarations do not involve data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string-based type aliases and type variables is standard, but the code imports types only during type checking, which is normal. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares protocols, type aliases, and type variables for validators, with conditional imports for type checking. There is no runtime dynamic code, external data handling, or suspicious constructs. The use of 'TYPE_CHECKING' is standard for avoiding import overhead. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward type annotation setup for validator functions and protocols. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or anomalies detected. The code appears safe and standard for type hinting in Python.",
