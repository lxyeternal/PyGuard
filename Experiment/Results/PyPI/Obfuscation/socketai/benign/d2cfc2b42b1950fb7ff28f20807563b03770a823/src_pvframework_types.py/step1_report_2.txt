{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define type aliases and protocols for validators, likely used in a validation framework or library.",
  "sources": "The code reads type annotations, imports, and variable assignments. No external input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network operations, file writes, or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "Type aliases and protocol definitions do not establish data flows or execute runtime logic involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code, is observed. The code primarily consists of type definitions and imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines type variables, protocols, and type aliases to structure validator functions and related types. It conditionally imports modules for type checking, which is standard practice. No runtime logic, data processing, or external input handling is present that could be exploited or malicious. The structure is typical for a type-focused module in Python, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard type definition module for a validation framework, with no malicious intent, security risks, or anomalies detected. It is primarily for static type checking and does not perform runtime operations involving untrusted data.",
