  "purpose": "Type definitions and protocol declarations for a validation framework, including type aliases for synchronous and asynchronous validators.",
  "sources": "import statements, type alias definitions, and class/variable declarations.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data access observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code is solely type annotations and protocol definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors detected. Use of TYPE_CHECKING for type hints is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases, protocol interfaces, and type variables for a validation framework, with no runtime logic or external data interactions. It relies on standard typing constructs and conditional imports for type hints. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The absence of runtime code, security-sensitive operations, or dynamic execution suggests a benign purpose focused on static type checking.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard set of type definitions and protocol declarations for a validation system, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely for type hinting and interface design, which are common in well-structured Python projects.",
