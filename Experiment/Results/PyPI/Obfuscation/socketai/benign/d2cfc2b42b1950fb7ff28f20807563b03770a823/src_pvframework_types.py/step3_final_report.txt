  "purpose": "Define type aliases and protocols for validator functions and data sets, supporting static type checking in a validation framework.",
  "sources": "Type aliases, Protocol class, conditional import for TYPE_CHECKING",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow or external data handling present",
  "flows": "N/A; static type definitions only",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard type hinting patterns",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type aliases, protocol definitions, and conditional imports for type checking, with no runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions. It serves as a static type hinting setup for validator functions and data sets, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard static type definition module for a validation framework. It poses no security threat, contains no malware, and is free of obfuscation. All signals and reports correctly identify its safe nature.",
