{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases and protocols for validators, likely part of a validation framework or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from typing (TYPE_CHECKING, Any, Callable, Coroutine, Protocol, TypeAlias, TypeVar) and internal modules (validator).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code mainly declares types and protocols.",
  "flows": "Type definitions and protocol declarations do not involve data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs. Use of 'if TYPE_CHECKING' is standard for type hints only.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes type aliases, protocol interfaces, and type variables for a validation system. It includes conditional imports for type checking, which is common to prevent runtime overhead. No data manipulation, network calls, or untrusted input handling is present. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or backdoors. The code appears clean and consistent with standard type hinting practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard type definition module for a validation framework, with no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues.",
