  "purpose": "Define type aliases and protocols for validator functions and data sets, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous validation mechanisms.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type variable definitions, type alias assignments, class protocol declaration.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted data sources; mainly type annotations and protocol definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely structural and type-related.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behaviors are present. The code appears to be a standard type annotation and protocol definition.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up type aliases, protocol classes, and type variables for use in a larger validation framework. It uses standard Python typing features and conditional import for type checking. There are no operations, data processing, or external interactions that could be malicious. No obfuscation, suspicious patterns, or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure is straightforward and typical for defining interfaces and type hints.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical type annotation and protocol setup for a validation framework, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is safe and intended for static type checking purposes only.",
