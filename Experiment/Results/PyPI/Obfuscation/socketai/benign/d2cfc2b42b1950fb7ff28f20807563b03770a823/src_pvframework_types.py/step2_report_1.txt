  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Type aliases and protocols for validators.\n- Findings: No data flow from untrusted sources; no suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Standard type definition module; no malicious activity.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies that the code is purely for static type hints and protocol definitions, with no runtime or external data processing. The logic and structure are typical and safe.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Defines type aliases and protocols for validators.\n- Findings: No external input, data flow, or suspicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Standard type definitions, no malicious intent.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, the analysis is accurate. The code is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Set up type aliases and protocols for validation.\n- Findings: No runtime logic, data processing, or external interactions.\n- Conclusion: Typical type annotation setup, benign.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correctly notes that the code is purely for static typing, with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Type definitions and protocol declarations.\n- Findings: No external data handling or suspicious code.\n- Conclusion: Standard type setup, safe.\n- Confidence: 1\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous assessments; the code is safe and standard.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Type aliases and protocols with conditional imports.\n- Findings: No data flow or malicious constructs.\n- Conclusion: Straightforward, safe type annotation code.\n- Confidence: 0.9\n- Malware: 0\n- Security risk: 0\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly less than perfect confidence, but still aligns with the overall conclusion that the code is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is purely for static type annotations, protocols, and type variables.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- **Security risks:** None identified.\n- **Scores:** All reports assign malware scores of 0, which is appropriate.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- The code does not execute any runtime logic, data processing, or external communication.\n- Use of `if TYPE_CHECKING` is standard for type hints.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.\n- The purpose is clearly to define types for a validation framework, which is safe.\n\n### Recommended Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n**Overall, the code is benign, well-structured, and standard for static type definitions.**",
