  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data sources or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version data, conditional import affecting type annotations, and setting version variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated boolean variable name; conditional import with a flag that disables type annotations; no apparent purpose for obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version information with hardcoded strings and tuples. It uses an obfuscated variable name to toggle type annotations via a boolean flag. When the flag is False, type annotations are replaced with a generic object type, possibly to reduce static analysis detection. The version data is straightforward and static. No untrusted input, external data, or suspicious behaviors are present. The obfuscation appears to be for code hiding or complexity rather than malicious intent. There are no external communication, credential handling, or malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated with a conditional type annotation mechanism, but it contains no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent, and the code's purpose is merely to set version information conditionally.",
