  "purpose": "Define version information for a package with conditional typing based on a flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it assigns hardcoded version data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and a conditional import based on a flag that is always set to False, leading to no dynamic or runtime behavior change. No secrets or sensitive data are hardcoded.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version constants with obfuscated variable names. A boolean flag is set to False, making the conditional import of typing modules skipped, and the type alias assigned to 'object' rather than a tuple type. The version data is hardcoded as strings and tuples. The obfuscation appears intentional but harmless, serving no malicious purpose. There are no external inputs, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious network or file operations. The code primarily serves to define version metadata with obfuscated variables.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless, serving only to store version information with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious behavior, malware, or security risk detected.",
