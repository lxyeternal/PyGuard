  "purpose": "Define version information and conditional type annotations based on a boolean flag.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded boolean flag (HPBxRNAbdttxjkXuahiAOgtzJfuwswNd), inline string assignments for version variables.",
  "sinks": "Assignment of version string and tuple to variables, no external data input or output points.",
  "flows": "Boolean flag determines whether type annotations are imported; variables are assigned static string and tuple values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; conditional import and type annotation based on a boolean flag, which is hardcoded and always False, making the conditional code effectively dead. No external input, no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a list of exported identifiers. It then sets a boolean variable with a nonsensical name to False. The conditional block that would import typing annotations and define a type alias is therefore never executed, and the type alias defaults to 'object'. Subsequently, version information is assigned as strings and tuples to variables with similarly obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leakage. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or for code obfuscation, but it does not conceal malicious intent. No external data sources or sinks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with obfuscated variable names and a conditional dead code block for type annotations. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears to be benign, with no security issues identified.",
