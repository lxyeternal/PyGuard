{
  "purpose": "Define version information and conditional typing based on a boolean flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads the boolean variable 'HPBxRNAbdttxjkXuahiAOgtzJfuwswNd' to determine the type of 'KiSqerCRQCpqyzMWmGMdICcOCImJDBkk'. It also assigns version strings and tuples directly in the code.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The boolean flag determines the type of 'KiSqerCRQCpqyzMWmGMdICcOCImJDBkk', but no untrusted data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, a boolean flag controlling type import, and no actual malicious code or data handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines module version info with obfuscated variable names. A boolean flag (HPBxRNAbdttxjkXuahiAOgtzJfuwswNd) controls whether typing annotations are imported and used. If true, a complex Tuple type is assigned; otherwise, a generic object type. Version info is assigned directly as strings and tuples. The structure appears to be deliberately obfuscated but lacks any malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated but does not contain malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It simply defines version info with conditional type annotations based on a flag. No harmful actions or security issues are evident.",
