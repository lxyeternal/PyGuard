  "purpose": "Defines version information with obfuscated variable names, including conditional type aliasing based on a flag.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and tuples, no external input or dynamic data.",
  "sinks": "None; static data assignment with no data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow from sources to sinks as code is static.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, conditional code controlled by a hardcoded False flag resulting in dead code, no dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version info with obfuscated variables, using a boolean flag set to False to disable type annotations. The conditional import and type aliasing are dead code. Version info is static and hardcoded. No external input, network activity, or malicious code is present. Obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. Malware score is 0, as no malicious behavior is detected. Security risk is minimal (~0.1), justified by obfuscation but no actual threat. The code is benign, serving only to store version info with superficial obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, with superficial obfuscation and no malicious intent. The static version info and dead code do not pose security risks. The assessments and scores in the reports are accurate and appropriate.",
