  "purpose": "Static configuration setup for documentation/build environment, involving import statements, sys.path modification, and variable assignments.",
  "sources": "File system paths, environment variables, static string assignments",
  "sinks": "No sensitive sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static assignments only",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a static setup script with no dynamic input, network activity, or code execution. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be part of a documentation or build configuration, typical in Sphinx or similar tools. No signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is stylistic and does not imply malicious intent.",
