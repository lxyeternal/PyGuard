  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks. Report 4's dynamic and obfuscated features suggest moderate suspicion; therefore, its malware score should be increased slightly to reflect potential malicious intent. The overall security posture remains low risk, but continued monitoring of dynamic features is advised."
