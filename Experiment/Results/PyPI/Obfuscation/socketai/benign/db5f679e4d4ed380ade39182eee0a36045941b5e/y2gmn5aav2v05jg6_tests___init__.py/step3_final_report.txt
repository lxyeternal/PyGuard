  "purpose": "Analysis of open source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving data processing, network operations, environment variables, dynamic execution (eval/exec), package setup routines.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data inputs or environment variables flow into processing functions, network calls, or dynamic eval/exec statements, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of dynamic eval/exec, obfuscation indicators, complex control flow, potential hardcoded secrets, suspicious network patterns, or unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in most reports, with low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 4 indicates dynamic features and obfuscation, raising suspicion but lacking direct malicious activity. Scores are generally consistent with the descriptions, with a notable exception in Report 4 where the suspicion warrants a higher malware and risk score. The overall assessment aligns with the observed behaviors, emphasizing cautious interpretation of dynamic and obfuscated code segments.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks. Report 4's dynamic and obfuscated features suggest moderate suspicion; therefore, its malware score should be increased slightly to reflect potential malicious intent. The overall security posture remains low risk, but continued monitoring of dynamic features is advised.",
