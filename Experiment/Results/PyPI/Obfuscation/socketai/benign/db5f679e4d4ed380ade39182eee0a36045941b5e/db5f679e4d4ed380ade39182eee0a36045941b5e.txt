      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation, malformed setup parameters, and suspicious entry points, indicating potential malicious intent. While no direct malicious actions are evident, the structure suggests sabotage or hidden payloads. The overall security risk is high, and further dynamic and source analysis of the 'pyupload' package is strongly recommended before deployment."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, representing a static assignment with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscation moderate (~0.4), and overall security risk minimal (~0.1). No further action is necessary."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a generic, obfuscated CLI uploader with dynamic function calls. No explicit malicious activity is evident, but obfuscation and external dependencies introduce potential risks. The assigned scores are appropriate; the main concern is verifying the behavior of the 'pyupload.uploader' module before deployment in security-sensitive contexts."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated file uploader that transmits files to an external server. While not explicitly malicious, its obfuscation and data exfiltration potential warrant cautious review. The current malware score of 0.2 is appropriate, but considering the obfuscation and external communication, a higher security risk score (around 0.6) is justified. Overall, the code poses moderate security concerns primarily due to its concealment and external data transfer capabilities."

      "confidence": 0.6,
      "conclusion": "The code snippet exhibits suspicious obfuscation through non-descriptive import names from internal modules, raising concerns about concealment or malicious intent. However, no direct evidence of malicious activity is present in this isolated snippet. The scores assigned are appropriate given the evidence, emphasizing the need for further investigation into the usage of these imports in the larger codebase."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to upload a file and retrieve its URL. There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious activity. Obfuscation and lack of validation are security concerns but not definitive indicators of malicious intent. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and potential misuse, but the code itself appears functionally legitimate."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscation, external data transmission, and reliance on undefined methods, indicating potential for malicious use such as data exfiltration. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, these indicators warrant further investigation, especially in supply chain contexts. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is non-negligible but not definitive."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a basic file uploader with obfuscated identifiers and an external dependency, which warrants caution. No direct evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors is present, but obfuscation and missing method implementations suggest potential for misuse. The overall security risk is moderate, and malware likelihood is low but not negligible. Further review of the missing method and context is recommended."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks. Report 4's dynamic and obfuscated features suggest moderate suspicion; therefore, its malware score should be increased slightly to reflect potential malicious intent. The overall security posture remains low risk, but continued monitoring of dynamic features is advised."
