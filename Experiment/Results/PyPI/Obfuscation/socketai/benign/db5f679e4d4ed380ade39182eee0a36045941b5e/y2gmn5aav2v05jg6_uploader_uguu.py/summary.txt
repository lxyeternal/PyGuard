  "conclusion": "The code functions as an obfuscated file uploader that transmits files to an external server. While not explicitly malicious, its obfuscation and data exfiltration potential warrant cautious review. The current malware score of 0.2 is appropriate, but considering the obfuscation and external communication, a higher security risk score (around 0.6) is justified. Overall, the code poses moderate security concerns primarily due to its concealment and external data transfer capabilities."
