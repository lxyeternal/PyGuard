  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads static strings and variables for package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; no data leaks or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "The static data used for setup flows directly into package configuration, with no dynamic or external data sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random and obfuscated variable names (e.g., HAzylXcIcFXweeWkzhaVNkgerHZSsUZW, QbyrQZpKayElLvzRsujIQGmqPzHmmuOc, EQuaGoEKbnTPsnsiojzcVwNAKbOyBvxZ). The hardcoded string 'y2gmn5aav2v05jg6' resembles a secret or obfuscated credential. The variable names do not relate to their contents and appear intentionally misleading or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names replacing typical metadata parameters. The presence of a string that looks like a secret or token ('y2gmn5aav2v05jg6') is suspicious, indicating potential hidden credentials or malicious intent. The code does not perform any malicious actions like network communication, file access, or code execution. However, the obfuscation and hardcoded string raise concerns about hidden purpose or malicious intent.\n\nThe script sets package metadata, dependencies, and console entry points in an unusual manner, likely to hide or obscure its true purpose. No evident data leaks or malicious actions are currently visible, but the obfuscation and secret-like string suggest caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a setup script with obfuscated variable names and a suspicious hardcoded string that could indicate hidden credentials or malicious intent. No explicit malicious actions are detected, but the obfuscation and embedded secret warrant further review before use.",
