{
  "purpose": "A file upload utility that reports progress, detects MIME types, and uploads files via HTTP POST with multipart encoding.",
  "sources": "Filename input, URL for upload, file content read during upload, filename extension for MIME detection.",
  "sinks": "HTTP POST request to upload the file, progress output to stdout.",
  "flows": "File content read from disk -> MultipartEncoder -> MultipartEncoderMonitor -> requests.post -> network transmission; progress callback updates stdout.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; standard library usage; no malicious payloads or network activity; MIME type fallback to 'plain/text' (should be 'text/plain').",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard file uploader with progress reporting and MIME detection. Obfuscation of class/method names suggests concealment but does not imply malicious intent. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The use of standard libraries and straightforward logic indicates benign functionality. The high obfuscation score (~0.75) is justified, but malware score remains 0 due to lack of malicious behavior. The low security risk (~0.2) reflects the benign nature but acknowledges obfuscation as a potential concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a benign, obfuscated file uploader utility. No malicious activity or payloads are evident. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and the overall security posture is low.",
