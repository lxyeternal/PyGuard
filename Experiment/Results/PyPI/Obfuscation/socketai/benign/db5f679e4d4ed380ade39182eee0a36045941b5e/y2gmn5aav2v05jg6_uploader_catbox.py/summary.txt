  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscation, external data transmission, and reliance on undefined methods, indicating potential for malicious use such as data exfiltration. While no explicit malicious payloads are present, these indicators warrant further investigation, especially in supply chain contexts. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is non-negligible but not definitive."
