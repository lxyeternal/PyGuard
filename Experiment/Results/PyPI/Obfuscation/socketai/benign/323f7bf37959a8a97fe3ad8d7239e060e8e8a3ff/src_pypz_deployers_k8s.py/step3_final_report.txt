  "purpose": "Deployment management for Kubernetes pipelines/operators, involving secrets, pods, and lifecycle control.",
  "sources": "Secrets, environment variables, pipeline/operator metadata from Kubernetes API.",
  "sinks": "Secrets, pods, logs, deployment configurations.",
  "flows": "Pipeline info encoded into secrets, secrets read for resource management, logs retrieved, pods created/deleted based on pipeline state.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class/variable names; encoding pipeline configs into secrets; lack of validation on secret contents.",
  "analysis": "The code manages secrets and pod lifecycle, encoding pipeline data into secrets via base64, and controlling operator deployment. No signs of malicious code, network exfiltration, or backdoors are present. Obfuscation appears to be superficial, likely for concealment. The handling of secrets without validation could be exploited if secrets are maliciously crafted, but no active malicious activity is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a Kubernetes deployment utility with obfuscated naming. It does not contain active malware or malicious behavior. The main security concern is potential exploitation via secrets or input data, which is currently not exploited. Overall, the security risk is low but warrants attention to secret management practices.",
