  "conclusion": "The code functions as a Kubernetes deployment utility with obfuscated naming. It does not contain active malware or malicious behavior. The main security concern is potential exploitation via secrets or input data, which is currently not exploited. Overall, the security risk is low but warrants attention to secret management practices."
