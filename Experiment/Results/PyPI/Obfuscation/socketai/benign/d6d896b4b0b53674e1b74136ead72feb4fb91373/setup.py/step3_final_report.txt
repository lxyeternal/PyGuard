{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' from the filesystem; imports 'tibber' module; uses static strings and parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import from 'tibber' occurs but no further data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; import from 'tibber' with a suspicious class name; import is unused but potentially malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. The import from 'tibber' with an obfuscated class name is suspicious, as it could execute malicious code if 'tibber' is compromised. No active malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data theft is observed. The heavy obfuscation and unusual import are likely attempts to hide malicious intent, but without concrete evidence, the code appears to be a potentially compromised package with obfuscation used to conceal its true nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and suspicious import behavior, raising moderate concern about supply chain security. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the potential for hidden malicious payloads warrants further investigation of the 'tibber' package and its contents before deployment.",
