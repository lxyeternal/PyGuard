{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, importing dependencies, reading a README file, and calling the setup function with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Import statements, reading 'README.md' file, setup() parameters, especially the imported 'tibber' module.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function parameters could potentially process untrusted data, but in this context, they are static strings and variables.",
  "flows": "Import 'tibber' module -> potentially executes code from tibber upon import -> reads 'README.md' -> supplies data to setup() -> installation process.",
  "anomalies": "The import from 'tibber' references a module that appears obfuscated or dynamically generated ('QbscfFJMkyJPhrrgmmyHieNFYiZmpzYz'), which could be suspicious. The variable names are nonsensical and obfuscated, and the module 'tibber' is a legitimate package but the import path is unusual, possibly indicating malicious intent or malicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup routine with 'setuptools' but imports a module 'tibber' with a suspiciously obfuscated name. The import could execute malicious code if 'tibber' is compromised or maliciously tampered with, especially if 'tibber' is not the legitimate package from PyPI. The reading of 'README.md' is benign. The setup() parameters are mostly static strings or lists. However, the use of an obfuscated module and non-standard variable naming suggests potential malicious or obfuscated behavior, possibly hidden to avoid detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script but includes an import from an obfuscated module 'tibber', which could be malicious or maliciously obfuscated. The rest of the code is typical, but the suspicious import raises concern about potential malicious behavior. Overall, the risk is moderate, warranting further inspection of the 'tibber' package.",
