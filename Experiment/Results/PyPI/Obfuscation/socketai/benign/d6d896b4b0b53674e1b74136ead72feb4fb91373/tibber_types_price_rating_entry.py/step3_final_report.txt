{
  "purpose": "A data container class that encapsulates energy-related metrics stored in a cache dictionary, providing property accessors for specific values.",
  "sources": "The cache dictionary initialized during object creation, and the 'tibber_client' object passed in constructor.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network operations, or data output points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input into the cache during initialization; properties access this data directly without modification or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable and method names, which could be an attempt to conceal purpose; no other suspicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that serves as a simple data holder for energy metrics, with properties to access specific cached values. The import from 'tibber.account' is conditional for type hints and does not impact runtime. There are no network activities, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The obfuscation of names is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The malware score is set to 0, reflecting no malicious activity; the security risk score is low, consistent with the benign nature of the code; the obfuscation score is high due to the non-descriptive naming. Overall, the code appears to be a benign, obfuscated data container with no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, obfuscated data wrapper with no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation is the main red flag but does not indicate malicious activity on its own. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
