{
  "purpose": "Define a class for handling cached data related to a Tibber account, with properties to access specific energy-related metrics.",
  "sources": "Data is read from the 'cache' dictionary within the class instance.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is written or transmitted outside the class, and no untrusted input processing is visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'cache' dictionary through property accessors returning specific metrics.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no clear indication of malicious code or backdoors; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with several property methods that access data from an internal cache dictionary. The variable names are obfuscated, but they do not indicate malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system manipulation. The class appears to be a simple data container with no external data input, no cryptic code execution, and no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The use of 'TYPE_CHECKING' for type hints is standard and harmless. Overall, this is a straightforward data structure with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign data container class with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The design is simple and does not involve suspicious external interactions.",
