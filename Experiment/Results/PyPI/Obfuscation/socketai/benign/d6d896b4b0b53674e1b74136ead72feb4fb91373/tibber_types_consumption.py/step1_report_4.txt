{
  "purpose": "This code defines a class for managing and accessing energy consumption data from a Tibber account, likely used for energy data processing or display.",
  "sources": "The class reads data from the 'cache' dictionary provided during initialization.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data transmission points are present; no network or external data output operations are visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'cache' dictionary to various property methods retrieving energy data fields.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior observed. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data access class with properties to retrieve energy-related data from an internal dictionary. There are no external calls, network operations, or input handling beyond initial data intake. All methods are simple getters. The code appears straightforward and adheres to standard design patterns for data encapsulation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior. It functions as a data accessor with no evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious intent.",
