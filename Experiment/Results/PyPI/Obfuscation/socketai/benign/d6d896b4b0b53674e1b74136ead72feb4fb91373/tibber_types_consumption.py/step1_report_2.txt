{
  "purpose": "Defines a class that wraps a cache dictionary with properties to access various data fields related to energy consumption and pricing.",
  "sources": "The cache dictionary (`self.cache`) initialized in the constructor, potentially from external input.",
  "sinks": "Properties access data from `self.cache`, but there are no direct sinks that process untrusted input further or send data elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the `cache` dictionary through property getters; no transformation or external data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or unusual behaviors detected. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The class initializes with a dictionary which could be externally provided. Properties simply retrieve values from this dictionary. No code execution, external network, or file operations are present. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The code appears to be a simple data wrapper. The lack of any data processing, external calls, or obfuscation suggests benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple data container with no malicious or suspicious elements. It securely encapsulates data access without performing any harmful actions. No malware or security risks identified.",
