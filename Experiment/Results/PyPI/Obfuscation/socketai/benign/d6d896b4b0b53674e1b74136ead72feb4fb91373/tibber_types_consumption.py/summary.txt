  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data container with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2)."
