  "purpose": "A class encapsulating energy data with obfuscated identifiers, serving as a data container for energy metrics.",
  "sources": "Initialization with a dictionary and a 'tibber_client' object; property methods accessing internal cache data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only reads from internal cache and provides data via getters.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the cache dictionary to property getters; no external data flows or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward data wrapper with obfuscated identifiers, providing property accessors for energy-related data. It does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or code execution. Obfuscation appears to be a stylistic or privacy measure rather than malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are present. The scores from reports are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data container with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious behavior. The malware score remains at 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2).",
