{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup including version, token, API endpoint, environment check, and module imports.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for version, token, URL; environment variable check; module imports.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or data flow to external systems; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization and import statements; no active data flow or execution of malicious commands.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; use of non-standard environment variable attribute; presence of hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily functions as configuration with obfuscated variable names and embedded secrets. The OS check adjusts asyncio policy based on environment. No active malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or command execution is evident. Obfuscation and hardcoded secrets pose security concerns but do not constitute malware. The code's structure suggests an intent to conceal details, which warrants caution but not definitive malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be configuration/setup code with obfuscation and embedded secrets. There is no evidence of active malicious behavior or malware. The high obfuscation and secrets exposure are security concerns but do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and secrets, but the code itself is not malicious.",
