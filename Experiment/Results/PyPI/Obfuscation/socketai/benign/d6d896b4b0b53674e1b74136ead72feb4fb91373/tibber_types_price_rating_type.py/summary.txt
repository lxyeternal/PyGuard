  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, heavily obfuscated data wrapper managing energy metrics, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the current analysis finds no active threats. Scores are consistent with this assessment: malware score 0, obfuscation high, risk low. Further context or runtime analysis is recommended for definitive security evaluation."
