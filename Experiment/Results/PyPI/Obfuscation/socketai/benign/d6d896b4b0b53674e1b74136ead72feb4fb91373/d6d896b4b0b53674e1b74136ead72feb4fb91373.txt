      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and suspicious import behavior, raising moderate concern about supply chain security. While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the potential for hidden malicious payloads warrants further investigation of the 'tibber' package and its contents before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code fragment does not show direct malicious activity but employs heavy obfuscation and verbose internal logging, which could conceal malicious intent or sensitive data leaks. The malware score is low (0.2), consistent with the absence of explicit malicious actions. The obfuscation score is high (0.8), justified by the non-descriptive naming. The security risk is moderate (~0.4), mainly due to logging practices and obfuscation, which should be reviewed further before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be configuration/setup code with obfuscation and embedded secrets. There is no evidence of active malicious behavior or malware. The high obfuscation and secrets exposure are security concerns but do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and secrets, but the code itself is not malicious."

The obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious; the assigned scores are justified. Continued monitoring is recommended if obfuscation is used extensively or in conjunction with other suspicious code."

The obfuscation appears to be a stylistic or auto-generated choice rather than an indicator of malicious intent. The security risk and malware scores should remain at 0, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.6-0.7) reflecting the naming pattern. Overall, the code poses minimal security concern."

The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the current analysis finds no active threats. Scores are consistent with this assessment: malware score 0, obfuscation high, risk low. Further context or runtime analysis is recommended for definitive security evaluation."
