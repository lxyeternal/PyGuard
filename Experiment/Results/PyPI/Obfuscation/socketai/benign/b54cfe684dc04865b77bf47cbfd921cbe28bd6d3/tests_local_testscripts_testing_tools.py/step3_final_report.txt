  "purpose": "Utility for modifying Python environment variables (MYPYPATH and PYTHONPATH) via CLI commands, appending or prepending directories based on user input.",
  "sources": "Path resolution functions, command-line arguments, environment variable retrievals (os.environ), user input paths.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables being set or modified (os.environ), which influence subsequent process behavior.",
  "flows": "Input paths are resolved and checked; then environment variables are updated with new path strings, potentially influenced by existing environment variables.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, lack of input validation for directory paths, no sanitization or validation of user input, no network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides CLI commands to append or prepend directories to environment variables, with path resolution and existence checks. Obfuscated variable names hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. Environment variables are manipulated at runtime, which could be misused if inputs are malicious, but this pattern is common in configuration scripts. The lack of input validation is a minor concern but not inherently malicious. Obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for managing Python environment paths. It does not contain malicious code or behavior. Obfuscation is superficial and does not constitute malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, with potential for misuse if inputs are untrusted, but no active threats are present.",
