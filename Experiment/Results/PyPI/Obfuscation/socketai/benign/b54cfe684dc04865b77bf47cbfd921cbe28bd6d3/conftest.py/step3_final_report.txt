{
  "purpose": "Configure pytest behavior by defining a list of tests to ignore and modifying test arguments.",
  "sources": "The function reads no external data; it operates solely on the 'args' parameter and defines an unused 'additional_pytest_args' list.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data is processed; the code only modifies the 'args' list in-place without external effects.",
  "flows": "The function takes 'args', unions it with an empty list, and assigns it back, resulting in no change; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'jxGnSlZgfXVVmEedokIcNiLIzcaYICTm' is obfuscated and non-descriptive, which is suspicious but not malicious; the 'additional_pytest_args' list is unused.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and typing.List, declares a 'collect_ignore' list, and defines an obfuscated function that takes pytest configuration objects and a list of arguments. Inside, it creates an empty list 'additional_pytest_args' and updates 'args' with its union, which is effectively a no-op. No secrets, network activity, or malicious code are present. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The function's logic is benign, serving as a pytest configuration snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, high obfuscation) are appropriate given the code's benign nature. The obfuscation alone warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign pytest configuration snippet with an obfuscated function name. No malicious activity, secrets, or vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. The assigned scores are reasonable, and no changes are necessary.",
