  "purpose": "Configure pytest behavior by modifying command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'args' which may contain untrusted input data.",
  "sinks": "Modifying 'args' list in-place, which could influence pytest execution or lead to unintended behavior.",
  "flows": "Function receives 'args', adds additional arguments (none in this case), and updates 'args' in-place.",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated, which is unusual and could be suspicious. No other malicious code or hardcoded secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and typing.List, declares an empty list for 'collect_ignore', and defines a function with an obfuscated name. The function takes pytest configuration objects and a list of arguments, then adds no additional arguments. The obfuscated name and minimal logic could be indicative of hiding malicious intent, but based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data flows. The code appears to be a benign customization of pytest behavior, albeit with suspicious naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign and primarily customizes pytest argument handling. No malicious behavior detected, but the obfuscated function name warrants cautious review in broader context.",
