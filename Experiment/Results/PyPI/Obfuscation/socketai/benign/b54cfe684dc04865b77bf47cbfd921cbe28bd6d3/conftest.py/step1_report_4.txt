  "purpose": "Configure pytest collection ignore list and define a function to modify pytest arguments",
  "sources": "Import statements, function parameters, and local variables within the function",
  "sinks": "Modification of 'args' list which may influence pytest execution parameters",
  "flows": "Function receives 'args' and appends a set of additional arguments to it, altering pytest behavior",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'jxGnSlZgfXVVmEedokIcNiLIzcaYICTm' appears obfuscated, but this alone is not malicious; no other suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports pytest and typing.List, initializes a list for ignored collection items, and defines a function that modifies the 'args' list by adding potentially additional pytest arguments. The function name is obfuscated, which could be a sign of concealment but may also be meaningless obfuscation. No hardcoded credentials, network calls, or malicious logic are present. The code modifies pytest configuration in a benign manner, possibly for customizing test runs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward pytest configuration snippet with obfuscated function name. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks, merely modifying test parameters. No malware or security issues are evident.",
