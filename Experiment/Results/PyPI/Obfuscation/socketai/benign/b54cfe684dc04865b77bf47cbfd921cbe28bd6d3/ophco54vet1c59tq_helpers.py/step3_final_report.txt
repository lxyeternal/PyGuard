  "sources": "Input strings passed to functions, specifically the parameter mAeDxIQkrRRIewbOQAJFEUuebIJteFMK in wlwWubEuSpsgPsrglBjavytZTMNoRQLv and wApUjfGLGNSlcDqPXjwEcdBbCFuWTGVt in QcDyoSOTFdivwccBrkKwcZBMaNfuwQeI.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or external data outputs; functions only process input strings locally.",
  "flows": "Input strings are first stripped of trailing backslashes, then optionally split at the first backslash, returning the first segment.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names are obfuscated, but logic is straightforward; no malicious or obfuscated code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple string operations: stripping trailing backslashes and splitting at the first backslash. No external communication, dynamic code execution, or malicious patterns are present. Obfuscation is limited to naming, not behavior. The functions are utility-like, with benign intent. No hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious logic are observed. The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware score is correctly zero; security risk is minimal. The code's simplicity and lack of external effects confirm benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for string sanitization and parsing, with superficial obfuscation in naming. There is no evidence of malicious activity, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate.",
