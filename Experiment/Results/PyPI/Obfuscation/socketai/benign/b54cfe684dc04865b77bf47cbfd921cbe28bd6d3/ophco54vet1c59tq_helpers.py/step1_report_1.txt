{
  "purpose": "The code processes strings by stripping backslashes and splitting input strings at the first backslash, possibly for sanitization or parsing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input strings passed to functions `wlwWubEuSpsgPsrglBjavytZTMNoRQLv` and `QcDyoSOTFdivwccBrkKwcZBMaNfuwQeI`",
  "sinks": "The functions do not write data to external systems or perform network operations; they only manipulate string data internally.",
  "flows": "Input string -> `wlwWubEuSpsgPsrglBjavytZTMNoRQLv` strips backslashes -> `QcDyoSOTFdivwccBrkKwcZBMaNfuwQeI` further splits the string at the first backslash and returns the first part.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward string manipulations with no use of obfuscation, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden behaviors. The splitting and stripping may be part of input sanitization, but no malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "Both functions perform simple string processing. The first function removes backslashes from the end of the string, which might be intended to sanitize or normalize input. The second function calls the first, then splits the string at the first backslash and returns the part before the backslash. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or external communication. The code appears benign and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple string sanitization and parsing without any malicious intent or security risks. No suspicious behavior or malware indications are present.",
