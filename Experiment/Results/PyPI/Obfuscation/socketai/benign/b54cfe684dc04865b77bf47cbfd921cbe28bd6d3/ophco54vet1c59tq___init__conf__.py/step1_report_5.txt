  "purpose": "Provide informational details about the 'lib_registry' Python package, including version, URL, author, and contact info.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments and a print statement within a function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data flow involving external input or output streams.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only outputs static information.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., hnuOQFbCXcarThLMzhvCEafiuXlkJSMm), which could be an attempt to obscure intent. No malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple variables with seemingly random or obfuscated names, storing static informational data such as package name, version, URL, author, and email. It includes a function that prints this info in a formatted manner. No external input handling, network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident. The obfuscated variable names might be a concern, but they do not lead to malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be purely informational, serving as a package metadata display. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The obfuscated variable names are likely stylistic or for minimal concealment but do not indicate malicious intent.",
