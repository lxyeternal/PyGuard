  "purpose": "Provide informational details about the 'lib_registry' Python package, including version, URL, author, and contact information.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for package name, version, URL, author, email, and the print statement in the function.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs information to the console, which is benign and not a data sink leading to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The function when called outputs static package info; no data flows from external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, no hardcoded credentials beyond contact info, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation, and no external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several variables containing static metadata about a Python package and a function that prints this information. There are no inputs, no data processing, no network connections, and no suspicious activities. All content appears to be purely informational with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple informational script providing package details. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malicious indicators are present.",
