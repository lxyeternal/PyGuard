  "purpose": "Display static package metadata information about 'lib_registry'.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to variables with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs the metadata; no untrusted data sources involved.",
  "flows": "Variable assignments (sources) to the print function (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or dynamic behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static package info to variables with obfuscated names and prints this info via a function. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. All reports correctly identify the code as benign, static, and informational. Malware scores are zero; obfuscation scores are modest (around 0.2 to 0.7) due to variable naming. Security risk scores are very low, reflecting the benign nature. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and purely informational. Obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. All assessments are accurate; no adjustments needed.",
