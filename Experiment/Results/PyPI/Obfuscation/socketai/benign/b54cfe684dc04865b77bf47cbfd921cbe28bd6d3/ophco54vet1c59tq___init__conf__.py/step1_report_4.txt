  "purpose": "Provide information about the 'lib_registry' Python package, including its description, version, URL, author, and email.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments for package details and the print statement in the function hnuOQFbCXcarThLMzhvCEafiuXlkJSMm.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs static information; no untrusted data, user input, or external sources are involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded variables to the print statement within the function; no external data sources or untrusted inputs are processed.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden behavior. The function is straightforward and solely outputs static info.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several variables containing package metadata, including name, version, URL, author, and email, all hardcoded. It then defines a function that prints this information. There are no external inputs, network connections, or data manipulations that could be malicious. The code appears to be purely informational, serving as documentation or package metadata display without any malicious intent or security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, containing only static metadata and a simple print function. There is no indication of malicious behavior, malicious data flows, or security risks. It functions solely to display package info, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
