  "purpose": "Provide informational metadata about the 'lib_registry' Python library, including description, version, URL, author, and email.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals containing package information and prints them in a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no untrusted data sources or sinks that process external input or data.",
  "flows": "The function hnuOQFbCXcarThLMzhvCEafiuXlkJSMm() outputs static information; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The code consists of static string assignments and a simple print statement.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several variables with static package information and a function that prints this data. No user input, environment variables, or external data is processed. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leakage. The structure is straightforward and appears to serve informational purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, providing static metadata about a Python library. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
