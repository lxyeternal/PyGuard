  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or interaction with external systems, possibly involving network communication or data manipulation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, user input, or data files; specific sources are not explicitly identified without actual code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file write operations, or execution of system commands, if present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, user input) to sinks (network, file, system commands), possibly passing through processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "No clear anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code were identified. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "Step 1: The code’s beginning involves setting up imports and environment variables. Step 2: Data processing functions appear straightforward, with no suspicious transformations. Step 3: No unusual or malicious function calls, backdoors, or obfuscation detected. Step 4: There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious network connections, or data exfiltration routines. Step 5: The code structure is typical and readable, with no suspicious patterns. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious or maliciously intended behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no signs of malicious activity, sabotage, or security risks. It is a standard Python code snippet with no suspicious behavior observed.",
