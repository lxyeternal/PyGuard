  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Code input, external network calls, environment variables, data processing functions, imported libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network communication points, data output, environment variable access, file operations, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input data or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may lead to network transmission, file writing, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious network activity; no code provided in some reports.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with the benign descriptions. Confidence levels are high where detailed analysis is provided. No suspicious behaviors or indicators are present. The reasoning aligns with the evidence, and the low security risk reflects minimal concern. The lack of code in some reports justifies zero scores and high confidence in benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets and reports indicate benign, non-malicious Python code with no obfuscation or security issues. The current scoring (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) is appropriate and justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
