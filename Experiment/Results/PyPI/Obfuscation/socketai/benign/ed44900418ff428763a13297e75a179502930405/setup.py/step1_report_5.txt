{
  "purpose": "The code defines setup configuration for a Python package, including reading the README file and specifying package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file using pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / 'README.md'",
  "sinks": "The setup() function may write or utilize package metadata but no untrusted data sinks are directly present",
  "flows": "Reads the README.md content and passes static metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, but there are no suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib and setuptools, reads a README file, and calls setup() with package metadata. Variable names are unusual but consistent with obfuscation or minification, not necessarily malicious. There are no network connections, no code execution from untrusted sources, and no suspicious operations. The purpose aligns with standard package setup procedures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected based on the provided code.",
