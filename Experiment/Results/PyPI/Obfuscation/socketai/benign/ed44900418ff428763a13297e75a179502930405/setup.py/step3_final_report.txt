  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a module, reading README.md for metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, static variable assignments",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks",
  "flows": "Reading file content into variable, passing static data to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not affect functionality but are unusual for such scripts",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script that imports pathlib and setuptools, reads README.md content, and calls setup() with static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The only notable anomaly is the obfuscated variable names, which are not inherently malicious but are unconventional. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, indicating no malicious activity. The obfuscation score is high due to variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. Security risk scores are low, consistent with benign package setup code. No evidence of sabotage, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. The high obfuscation does not imply malicious intent in this context. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
