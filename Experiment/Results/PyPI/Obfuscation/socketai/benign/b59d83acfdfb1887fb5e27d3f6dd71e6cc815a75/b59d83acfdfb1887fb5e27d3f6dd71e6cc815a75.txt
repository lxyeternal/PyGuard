      "conclusion": "The setup script itself is benign, but the inclusion of 'bot.exe' and the obfuscated package name raise moderate suspicion. Further inspection of 'bot.exe' is recommended before trusting or deploying this package. The current evidence suggests moderate security risk primarily due to packaging choices rather than malicious code within the script."

      "conclusion": "The code is assessed as benign with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are justified. The overall security risk remains minimal (0.2), primarily due to limited context or incomplete code snippets, but current evidence indicates safety."
