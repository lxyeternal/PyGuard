  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script for performing some data processing or functionality. Specific purpose details are not explicitly clear from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from variables, functions, or external modules. No explicit external input sources such as files, network, or environment variables are identified in the provided code fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions, file writes, or network transmissions if present. No explicit sinks are clearly identifiable from the provided code.",
  "flows": "The code likely flows from data input sources through processing functions to output or storage sinks, but specific flow paths cannot be confirmed without more detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic execution, or obfuscated code are apparent. The code structure appears standard and transparent.",
  "analysis": "A detailed step-by-step analysis reveals no signs of malicious behavior. There are no indications of code injection, data leakage, insecure use of environment variables, or unsafe SQL. Usage of third-party libraries seems standard. No suspicious patterns or anomalies are observed in the provided code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious data exfiltration.",
