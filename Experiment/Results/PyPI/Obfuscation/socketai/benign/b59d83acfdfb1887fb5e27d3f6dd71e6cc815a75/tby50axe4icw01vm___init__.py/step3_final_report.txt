  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file write/read, environment variable access, system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment) to sinks (network, files, system).",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, utilizing standard libraries without suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are evident. Confidence levels are high where code is complete, and low where incomplete. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The security risk scores are low, reflecting minimal concern. No code injection, data leakage, or unsafe practices observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is assessed as benign with no malicious intent, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The low malware score (0) and obfuscated score (0) are justified. The overall security risk remains minimal (0.2), primarily due to limited context or incomplete code snippets, but current evidence indicates safety.",
