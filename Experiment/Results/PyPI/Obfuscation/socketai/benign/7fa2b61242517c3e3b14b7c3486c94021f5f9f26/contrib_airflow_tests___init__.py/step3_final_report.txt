  "purpose": "Shebang and encoding declaration headers with no executable code.",
  "sources": "Header comments, shebang line, encoding declaration",
  "sinks": "None, as there is no data input/output or code execution",
  "flows": "No data flows; code contains only static comments",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code is purely a shebang and encoding comment with no operational logic. All reports correctly identify this minimal structure as benign, with no malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0, confidence: 1) are consistent and appropriate given the content. No issues or vulnerabilities are present, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign header with no executable or malicious content. All reports are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary. The overall security risk, malware likelihood, and obfuscation are effectively zero.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
