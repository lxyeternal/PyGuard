  "purpose": "The code snippet is a shebang line indicating that the script should be executed using the Python interpreter and specifies UTF-8 encoding for the script.",
  "sources": "No data input or reading operations are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data output or untrusted data handling operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond the initial script metadata is present.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of a shebang and encoding declaration with no executable logic, no imported modules, and no functional code. There are no anomalies or suspicious activities.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is only a shebang line and encoding declaration, serving as metadata for script execution and character encoding. It does not include any functional code, input handling, or data processing. Since no executable or data manipulation code is present, there are no security concerns or malicious indicators within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, serving as a script header with no malicious or suspicious behavior. It does not contain any operational logic, data handling, or security risks.",
