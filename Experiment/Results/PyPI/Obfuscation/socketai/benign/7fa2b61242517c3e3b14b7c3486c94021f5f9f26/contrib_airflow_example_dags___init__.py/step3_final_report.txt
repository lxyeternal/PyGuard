{
  "purpose": "This code snippet serves as a minimal script header, including a shebang line and UTF-8 encoding declaration, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a shebang and encoding declaration present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data or external outputs are involved.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code contains only static declarations without runtime data movement.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is straightforward boilerplate with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line and an encoding comment, serving as boilerplate for a Python script. There are no functions, imports, data processing, or executable statements. No sources, sinks, or data flows are present. The code is benign, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The assessments from the reports are consistent and accurate, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with high confidence. The code's simplicity and lack of operational logic justify these scores and conclusions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign boilerplate header with no malicious or suspicious features. The reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
