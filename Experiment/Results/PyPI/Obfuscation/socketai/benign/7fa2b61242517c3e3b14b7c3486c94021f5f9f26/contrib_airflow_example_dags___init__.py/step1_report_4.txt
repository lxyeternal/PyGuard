  "flows": "No data flows, source-to-sink paths, or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains shebang and encoding declaration comments; no executable code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is minimal, consisting solely of a shebang line and a file encoding comment. There are no imports, functions, classes, or executable statements. Since no logic exists, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. The lack of code significantly reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided content, the code is a minimal placeholder with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain executable logic or data handling mechanisms that could be exploited or malicious.",
