{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a shebang and encoding declaration, typically used to specify the environment and character encoding for a Python script.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not write or process data in a way that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as there are no executable statements beyond the shebang and encoding declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and only contains standard shebang and encoding comments; no suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line indicating the script should be run with the user's environment Python interpreter, and a UTF-8 encoding declaration. These are common boilerplate comments and do not include any executable logic, input handling, or external dependencies. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code does not perform any operations that could be exploited or that indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless and only contains standard script headers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
