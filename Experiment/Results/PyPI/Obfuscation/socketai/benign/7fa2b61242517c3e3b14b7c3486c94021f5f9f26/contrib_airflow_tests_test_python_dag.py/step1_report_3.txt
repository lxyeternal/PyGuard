  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG with a task that increments a number and performs a run, then validates task outputs.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'number' in the task, external imports, and method calls.",
  "sinks": "XCom pull calls to retrieve task outputs, DAG run creation and task execution.",
  "flows": "Input 'number' -> task function -> task output -> XCom pull for validation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded keys ('43') in returned dict and XCom retrieval. No sensitive data or credentials embedded. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from a base, with a nested task function decorated with Airflow's task decorator. The task simply increments a given integer. The DAG run is manually triggered with current UTC time, using imported functions and variables that appear to be standard. The task's outputs are checked via XCom pulls, comparing expected values. No external data sources, environment variables, or untrusted inputs are apparent beyond the initial 'number' argument. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious commands are detected. The use of fixed keys ('43') and standard Airflow functions are consistent with typical DAG workflows. Overall, no malicious or malicious-looking behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Airflow DAG setup with a simple task for incrementing a number and verifying its output. No evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks was found. It uses common patterns and libraries appropriately. The code is clean, straightforward, and contains no suspicious elements.",
