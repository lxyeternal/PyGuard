  "purpose": "Define an Airflow DAG with tasks that process JSON data and compute total values.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded JSON string in BGUJEMptQRFgCgTbbbZgcLRVmaMlNZzS(), no external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Print statement in wgvAiHtrCCmQDnFBmMkPUKYQSCgoFHKu(), outputs data to console, no external data leaks.",
  "flows": "json.loads() reads hardcoded JSON, data flows through calculations, and results are printed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Airflow DAG with three tasks: one that loads hardcoded JSON data, another that sums the values, and a third that prints the total. No external input sources, no use of untrusted data, no network communications, and no dynamic code execution. The tasks operate solely on static, hardcoded data, which poses no security risk. The print statement is benign and intended for debugging or logging. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Airflow DAG with static data processing. It does not contain malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The code is safe, with no signs of malware or malicious activity.",
