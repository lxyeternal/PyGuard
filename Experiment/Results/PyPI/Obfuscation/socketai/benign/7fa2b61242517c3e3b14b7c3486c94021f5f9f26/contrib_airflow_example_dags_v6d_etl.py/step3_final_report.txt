  "purpose": "Process static, hardcoded JSON data to sum order values and output the total.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded JSON string within the code.",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputting the total order value.",
  "flows": "JSON string is loaded via json.loads, values are summed in a loop, and the result is printed.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated; a coding bug exists where the print statement references an undefined variable 'total_order_value' instead of the correct variable name.",
  "analysis": "The code processes static data without external input or network activity, indicating benign behavior. Obfuscated variable names suggest superficial obfuscation but no malicious intent. The bug is a simple coding mistake, not security-related. No signs of malware such as data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious code execution are present. The obfuscation level is moderate due to variable naming, but this does not imply malicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static data processing with superficial obfuscation and a minor coding bug. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is not malicious, and the overall security risk is negligible.",
