  "purpose": "This code is a shebang and encoding declaration, likely serving as the start of a script.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing are visible in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only metadata (shebang and encoding comment), with no executable logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of the shebang line and a UTF-8 encoding comment, which are standard for Python scripts. There are no functions, classes, data processing, or external library calls present. Without additional code, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified. The snippet is typical boilerplate used to specify script interpreter and file encoding.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be a standard script header.",
