{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal boilerplate header, providing the shebang and encoding declaration for a Python script, with no executable logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "None; the code contains only shebang and encoding comments, no input or data reading points.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks, untrusted data flows, or potential data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist, as the code lacks operational logic or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, suspicious constructs, or obfuscated elements; only standard boilerplate comments.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely boilerplate with no functional or malicious components. All reports correctly identify the lack of executable logic, data flow, or anomalies. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign nature. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present, and the code does not perform any operations that could harm or compromise systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless boilerplate with no malicious intent or security concerns. The assessments and scores across all reports are accurate and appropriate. No modifications or further analysis are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
