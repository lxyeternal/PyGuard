  "purpose": "This code appears to be a shebang and encoding declaration, likely part of a script file intended to be executed directly.",
  "sources": "No sources of input or data are present in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present as there is no operational code beyond headers.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a shebang and encoding declaration with no functional code, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The snippet includes only the shebang line ('#! /usr/bin/env python') and a coding declaration ('# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-'). These are standard declarations at the start of Python scripts for execution environment specification and encoding. No input sources, data processing, or external interactions are visible. Without additional code, there are no apparent security issues, malicious behaviors, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone is harmless and standard boilerplate for Python scripts. No malicious intent or security risk is detectable from these lines.",
