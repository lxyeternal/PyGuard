{
  "purpose": "The code is a unittest class for managing Airflow DAGs, performing database cleanup and setup routines, with obfuscated variable and method names.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, creates ORM sessions, queries and deletes DagRun and TaskInstance records.",
  "sinks": "Database operations via ORM; no untrusted data flows into dangerous sinks.",
  "flows": "Sources (environment variables, ORM session creation) lead to database deletions and manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and method names; no malicious code or external network activity; standard test/maintenance routines.",
  "analysis": "The code performs database cleanup for Airflow DAGs using ORM sessions, with obfuscated identifiers. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The code's purpose appears benign, serving as a test or maintenance utility. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscation: ~0.7, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No evidence suggests malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated test/setup routine for Airflow, with no malicious activity detected. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low. The scores are appropriate; no revisions are necessary.",
