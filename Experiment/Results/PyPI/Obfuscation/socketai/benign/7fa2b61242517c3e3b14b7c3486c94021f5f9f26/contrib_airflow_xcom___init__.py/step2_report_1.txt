  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the reported issues, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\n#! /usr/bin/env python\n# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-\nfrom .backend import rdiAzlgDyHjCOjECtLkjTTXDjONMESMw\n```\n\n---\n\n### General observations:\n- The code is minimal, consisting only of an import statement.\n- The imported symbol/module name `rdiAzlgDyHjCOjECtLkjTTXDjONMESMw` appears obfuscated or auto-generated.\n- No other logic, data flow, or network activity is visible.\n- The purpose is unclear without additional context.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Recognizes the minimal code and notes the obfuscated name, suggesting suspicion but no definitive malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.0, Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The high obfuscation score is justified. Malware score is low, consistent with the lack of evidence.\n- **Verdict:** The reasoning is sound. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes obfuscated naming, cautious but not conclusive.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.7, Risk = 0.3.\n- **Assessment:** The scores are reasonable; obfuscation is high, malware is zero.\n- **Verdict:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Again, minimal import, obfuscated name, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.5, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower obfuscation score, which is acceptable. The reasoning aligns with the evidence.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same pattern, no suspicious behavior, just an import with an obfuscated name.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to others, notes that obfuscated name could suggest concealment but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.7, Risk = 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning and scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet does not contain any malicious logic or data flow.\n- **Obfuscation:** The high obfuscation scores are justified given the naming.\n- **Malware risk:** Zero across all reports, which is appropriate based on the evidence.\n- **Risk scores:** Slightly conservative but acceptable, given the obfuscation and minimal code.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The high obfuscation scores reflect suspicion but are not indicative of actual malware.\n- No adjustments needed unless further code or context reveals malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimation:\n**Malware score:** 0.0 (no evidence of malicious activity)  \n**Obfuscated score:** ~0.7 (consistent with naming pattern)  \n**Risk score:** ~0.2 (minimal risk, but obfuscation warrants caution)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are consistent and justified. The code snippet itself appears benign, with obfuscation being the main concern. No changes to the scores are necessary based on the provided information.",
