  "purpose": "The code imports a specific symbol from a local module named 'backend'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.backend' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in the provided snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow observable in this fragment",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'rdiAzlgDyHjCOjECtLkjTTXDjONMESMw' appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated identifier, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement. The imported symbol has a non-descriptive, seemingly random name, which is often associated with obfuscated code or malicious modules. No other code, data input, or processing is present to evaluate further. Without additional context, it's difficult to determine the intent. The unusual naming warrants caution but does not constitute proof of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone does not provide enough evidence of malicious behavior but exhibits obfuscated naming which may indicate intentional concealment or malicious obfuscation. Additional code would be necessary to assess further.",
