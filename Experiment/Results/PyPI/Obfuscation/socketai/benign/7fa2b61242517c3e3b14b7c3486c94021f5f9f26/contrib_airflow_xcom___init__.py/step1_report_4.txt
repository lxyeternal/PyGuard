  "purpose": "Importing a specific attribute or module from a local backend package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module: .backend",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis is possible due to minimal code; no source-to-sink paths are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable or module name 'rdiAzlgDyHjCOjECtLkjTTXDjONMESMw' appears obfuscated, which is suspicious, but no actual malicious activity can be inferred from just an import statement.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement importing a potentially obfuscated object or attribute from a local backend module. No further code executes or handles data, and there are no suspicious operations, network activity, or data leaks present in this snippet. The obfuscated name may suggest attempts at hiding functionality, but without additional context or code, it is not definitively malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an obfuscated attribute or module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based solely on this snippet. The obfuscated name warrants caution, but further context is required for a definitive assessment.",
