  "purpose": "Minimal import statement with an obfuscated module name, likely part of a larger project.",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '.backend' with obfuscated symbol 'rdiAzlgDyHjCOjECtLkjTTXDjONMESMw'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import source to potential usage, but no further code provided to establish data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and symbol name, minimal code with no logic, which could be used to conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement with an obfuscated name. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or network activity are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified due to the naming pattern, but malware and security risks are low given the lack of active code or suspicious operations. The consistent scores across reports reflect cautious suspicion based on naming but no concrete evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet appears benign but is suspicious due to obfuscation. No malicious activity is detected within this fragment. Further review of the actual 'backend' module is recommended to confirm its safety. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is high (~0.75), and overall risk is low (~0.2).",
