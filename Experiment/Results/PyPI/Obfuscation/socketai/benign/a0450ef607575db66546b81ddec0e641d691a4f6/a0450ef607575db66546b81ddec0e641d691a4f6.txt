      "conclusion": "The code is a utility for dynamic module and attribute import, with obfuscation that could be exploited in malicious contexts but no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or behavior. The high obfuscation scores and undefined variables suggest intentional concealment or incomplete snippets, warranting cautious handling. Overall, it poses a moderate security risk if inputs are untrusted, but no active malicious activity is detected."

There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The low malware score (0.1) and low security risk (0.2) are appropriate. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The main concern is code quality rather than security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for package and environment management, with no signs of malicious intent or active malware. Its use of serialization and subprocess calls warrants standard security caution but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, it is a well-structured, non-obfuscated environment inspection tool."

The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal the code's purpose but does not imply malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate; I recommend maintaining low malware and risk scores, with obfuscation scores reflecting the naming style."

There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not currently constitute malware or a high security threat."
