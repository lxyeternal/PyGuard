{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's search path for module discovery",
  "sources": "The code reads the built-in variable __path__ and __name__",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or sensitive data leakage observed",
  "flows": "Uses pkgutil.extend_path to modify __path__, no external data flow involved",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code with no apparent malicious or suspicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkgutil and extends the __path__ variable for the current package, which is a standard practice in namespace packages to support multiple directories. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no external network communication, and no unusual code constructs. The code is straightforward and common in package namespace extension scenarios.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a standard purpose of package path extension without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
