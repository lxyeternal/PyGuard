  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resources",
  "sources": "The code reads the existing __path__ variable which is used to locate package resources",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data from source to sink; the code only manipulates __path__ internally",
  "anomalies": "Use of pkgutil.extend_path is common in namespace packages, no unusual code structures or obfuscation detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports pkgutil, a standard library module, then extends __path__ with extend_path. This is a typical pattern in namespace packages to merge resource paths. No hardcoded secrets, external network connections, or malicious behaviors are present. The code does not perform any data processing or external interactions. It is a minimal, standard pattern for package resource management.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard and benign pattern used in namespace packages to extend resource search paths. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
