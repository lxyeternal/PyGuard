  "purpose": "Import internal modules for package initialization or functionality extension.",
  "sources": "Relative import statements from internal modules, including wildcard imports.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no external data or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules into namespace; no data flow or execution beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*), which can reduce clarity but are common in package __init__.py files; no obfuscation or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. Wildcard imports are used but are typical in package setup files. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors are present. The minimal structure and import pattern do not suggest malicious intent or security risks. The low scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk between 0.1 and 0.2) are justified. The slight elevation in security risk due to wildcard imports is acceptable and does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security issues. The import statements are standard for package initialization, and the reported scores are appropriate. Wildcard imports are discouraged for clarity but do not pose security risks in this context.",
