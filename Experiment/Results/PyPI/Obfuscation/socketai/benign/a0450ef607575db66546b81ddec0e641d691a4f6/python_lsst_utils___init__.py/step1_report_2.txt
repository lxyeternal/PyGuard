{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules, likely to include functions or classes into the current namespace for use in the package.",
  "sources": "Module imports from relative files (_packaging, deprecated, doImport, inheritDoc, version, wrappers)",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication points are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; these are import statements only",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is common; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual patterns observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements for internal modules, which is typical for organizing package structure. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, code execution, or data exfiltration. No anomalies like hardcoded credentials or obfuscated code are evident. The imports seem intended for internal use, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement block with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It is standard package setup code.",
