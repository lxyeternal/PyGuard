  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code only contains import statements from internal modules.\n- No external network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution is observed.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n- Use of relative imports is common in package code; wildcard imports (`from module import *`) are discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** No issues, benign package structure.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Comments:** The security risk score is very low, which is reasonable given the benign content.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as Report 1, standard package import code.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0\n- **Comments:** Zero security risk is appropriate.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard internal imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher security risk score (0.1) but still minimal and acceptable.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard package imports.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1\n- **Comments:** Appropriate, considering no malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Notes that wildcard imports are used, which can be poor practice but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher security risk due to wildcard imports, which can lead to namespace pollution and maintenance issues but do not directly indicate malicious activity.\n- **Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.2 is acceptable, though it might be slightly overstated if strictly considering security risks.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, which is correct.\n- **Risk score:** Slight variation, but generally low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### **Recommendations:**\n\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n- The only point of contention is the slightly elevated security risk in Report 5 due to wildcard imports. While not malicious, it's worth noting that wildcard imports are discouraged for clarity and maintainability but do not pose a security threat.\n\n---\n\n### **Final judgment:**\n\nBased on the code snippet and reports, **my estimated scores** are:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** (no obfuscation observed)\n- **Security risk:** **0.1** (consistent with minor concerns about wildcard imports, but overall very low risk)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate given the benign, straightforward import statements. No adjustments are necessary unless emphasizing best practices, which would be outside the scope of security assessment.",
