{
  "purpose": "This code imports various modules and functions from the current package for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules (_packaging, deprecated, doImport, inheritDoc, version, wrappers).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing paths are evident; just module imports.",
  "anomalies": "All imports are from internal modules with no visible suspicious behavior; no dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, which is standard practice for modular Python packages. No external data sources, user inputs, or untrusted data handling are evident. No suspicious patterns or obfuscation are detected. The imported modules are likely part of the package itself and serve to organize code or provide features. The absence of code execution, network activity, or data manipulation indicates no malicious intent or security risks based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard internal module imports without any suspicious or malicious behavior. It appears to be a typical package structure setup with no security issues or malware indicators.",
