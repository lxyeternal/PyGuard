{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules or submodules, likely part of a larger package, with no explicit logic or functionality shown.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing local modules or submodules (e.g., _packaging, deprecated, doImport, inheritDoc, version, wrappers).",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present as the code does not process data or perform actions; it only imports modules.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports are performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; import statements are straightforward. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules within the package. These imports suggest modular organization but reveal no malicious activity or unusual behavior. Since no executable logic, data processing, or external network interactions are included, the code appears benign. There is no indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple set of import statements for local modules within a package. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. It appears to be normal package structure code with no security concerns.",
