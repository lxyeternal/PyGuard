  "purpose": "Provides functions for dynamic import of modules and types based on string identifiers, handling nested modules and attribute retrieval.",
  "sources": "importlib.import_module for module import; attribute access via getattr on imported modules; input string split for nested modules.",
  "sinks": "Attribute access on imported modules; potential for executing untrusted code if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input string -> module import -> attribute retrieval -> return attribute or module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names; references to undefined variables such as previousError, extra, kLqKMPGuXpJgNGQoRGSxFCOQXWKmPSZR, indicating obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs dynamic imports and attribute access, which are standard but risky if inputs are untrusted. Obfuscated variable names and references to undefined variables suggest intentional obfuscation or incomplete snippets, raising suspicion but not evidence of malicious payloads. No network activity, file modifications, or payloads are present. The error handling retries with shorter module paths, typical for dynamic import logic. The overall structure indicates utility code that could be exploited if misused, but lacks direct malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for dynamic module and attribute import, with obfuscation that could be exploited in malicious contexts but no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or behavior. The high obfuscation scores and undefined variables suggest intentional concealment or incomplete snippets, warranting cautious handling. Overall, it poses a moderate security risk if inputs are untrusted, but no active malicious activity is detected.",
