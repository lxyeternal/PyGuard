  "purpose": "Utility functions for iterable processing, string splitting, range expansion, and value validation",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters and external calls such as string.find()",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable functions include string.find() (used in range splitting), and appending to val_name list",
  "flows": "Input data is processed, split, validated, and appended to val_name; no direct data leaks observed",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, inconsistent code structure, and multiple syntax errors (e.g., 'WjmGeMqiNfBobxCjziuCODZgIONkbSSM', missing 'if' in 'while index > 0 WjmGeMqiNfBobxCjziuCODZgIONkbSSM'), which suggest code is either intentionally obfuscated or corrupted",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement iterable chunking, string splitting, range expansion, and list validation. However, numerous syntax errors and inconsistent variable naming strongly suggest obfuscation or corruption. The logic that involves string processing and range calculations could potentially be used maliciously if combined with external inputs, but in its current form, it mainly processes data internally. No network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion about intent, but there's no direct evidence of malicious actions within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and contains syntax errors, indicating either malicious intent or significant corruption. It primarily manipulates data internally without clear malicious behavior. Due to the obfuscation and errors, confidence is low to moderate that it is malicious, but caution is advised.",
