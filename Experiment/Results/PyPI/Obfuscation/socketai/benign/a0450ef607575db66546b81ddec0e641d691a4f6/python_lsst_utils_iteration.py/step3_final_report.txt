  "purpose": "Utility functions for iterable chunking, string splitting, range parsing, and list handling.",
  "sources": "Functions read input data from iterables, strings, and lists; no external data sources or network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks, system modifications, or external communications are detected.",
  "flows": "Input data flows through utility functions such as chunk iteration, string splitting, and list validation without external side effects.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with inconsistent variable names, broken/incomplete code snippets, syntax errors, and potential code corruption; no evidence of malicious payloads or external data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises utility functions with obfuscated names and broken snippets, indicating either intentional obfuscation or corruption. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious system modifications are observed. The obfuscation and syntax issues raise suspicion but do not demonstrate malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0, and the obfuscation score is high (0.8), justified by variable naming and code complexity. The security risk score is moderate (0.3), reflecting caution due to obfuscation but no active threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be heavily obfuscated utility functions with syntax issues and incomplete snippets. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The primary concern is obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not currently constitute malware or a high security threat.",
