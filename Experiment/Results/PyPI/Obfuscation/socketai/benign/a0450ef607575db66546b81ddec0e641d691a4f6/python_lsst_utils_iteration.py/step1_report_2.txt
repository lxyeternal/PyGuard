  "purpose": "Utility functions for iterable processing, string splitting, range notation, and list validation.",
  "sources": "Reading input data from function parameters and built-in string methods (e.g., str.find).",
  "sinks": "None explicitly identified; no external network, file, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through string manipulations and list appends; no external or untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated function and variable names; incomplete or malformed code snippets, especially in 'NIltZIMFNTgKEQZbozLxFLxpLpLiPESt' and 'qwQFhqdlzoOJnNrgHlIWxPpoFQaLpsuI'; inconsistent and broken syntax (e.g., 'WjmGeMqiNfBobxCjziuCODZgIONkbSSM', 'types' undefined, missing 'else' conditions). The code appears intentionally obfuscated or corrupted, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple functions performing iterable slicing, string splitting, range notation, list validation, and range-to-string conversion. Several functions include obfuscated names and complex logic, but primarily they operate on data without external I/O. Notably, parts of the code are syntactically broken or incomplete, such as unclosed 'if' statements and undefined variables, suggesting obfuscation or corruption. There is no evidence of malicious actions like network communication, file operations, or secret exfiltration. However, the heavy obfuscation and incomplete code could be indicative of attempts to hide malicious intent or hinder analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears heavily obfuscated with broken syntax, making precise interpretation difficult. No explicit malicious behavior or malicious sinks are identifiable. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not provide concrete evidence of malware or malicious actions within this snippet. Due to the corrupted structure and obscure naming, confidence in fully assessing intent is low, but no definitive malicious activity is evident.",
