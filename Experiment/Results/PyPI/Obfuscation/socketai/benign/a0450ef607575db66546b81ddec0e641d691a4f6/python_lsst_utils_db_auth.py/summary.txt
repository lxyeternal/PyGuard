  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate configuration utility for database credentials, with superficial obfuscation and some coding flaws. There is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain sabotage. The low malware score (0.1) and low security risk (0.2) are appropriate. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The main concern is code quality rather than security threat."
