  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; undefined variable 'N' in error message of xNeSArtAzLLLGxHFoUZIemjHwaCBzDCi",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility functions for handling convolution parameters, shape calculations, and version checks. Variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, but no malicious code or network activity is present. The version check is straightforward, and shape validation functions are standard. The undefined variable 'N' in an error message is a minor bug, not malicious. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. No external data flows or suspicious sinks are identified. Overall, the code is benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern, which does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions with obfuscated naming, performing standard operations without malicious intent. No malware or security risks are evident, and the obfuscation likely serves concealment or proprietary reasons. The supply chain security posture is low risk.",
