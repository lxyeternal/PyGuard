  "purpose": "Check the version of the 'setuptools' package and ensure it meets a minimum version requirement before running setup with SCM versioning.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version retrieval from 'setuptools', version comparison, and setup invocation.",
  "sinks": "sys.exit() calls, print statements, and setup() function invocation.",
  "flows": "Import and version check source → conditionally print error and exit → or proceed to setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code present; no suspicious network activity or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules to check the installed version of 'setuptools'. It defines variables with obfuscated names holding version information. If 'setuptools' is outdated, it prints an error and exits; otherwise, it proceeds to run setup() with SCM versioning. All operations are standard for setup scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. No external network calls, data leaks, or backdoors are evident. The variable names are intentionally obscure, which might be considered suspicious, but do not imply malicious intent in context.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a version check on 'setuptools' before executing setup(). There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but do not indicate malware or sabotage. Overall, this appears to be a legitimate setup script with no security issues.",
