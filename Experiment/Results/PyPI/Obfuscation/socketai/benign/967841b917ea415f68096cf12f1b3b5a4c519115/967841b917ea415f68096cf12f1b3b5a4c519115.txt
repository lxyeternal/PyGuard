There is no evidence of malicious activity, such as network communication, data theft, or sabotage. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which should be reviewed in the context of trustworthiness of dependencies and source."

The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware likelihood remains very low. The overall security risk is low, though the obfuscation warrants cautious review of external functions and further deobfuscation for clarity."

The risk is moderate due to obfuscation and reliance on opaque external functions. Further review of the external utility functions is recommended to rule out hidden malicious payloads."

There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active malware. The overall security risk is low, though resource usage should be monitored if deployed in production to prevent potential denial-of-service scenarios."
