{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package that imports specific functions or classes from modules within the 'unfoldNd' package and defines an export list.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'unfoldNd' package modules: 'fold', 'unfold', and 'unfold_transpose', importing specific functions or classes.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data; it only imports functions/classes and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "There are no external data flows or untrusted data handling; imports are static, and __all__ is a fixed list.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns are present. The import statements and __all__ declaration are standard. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, importing specific functions/classes from internal modules and defining an __all__ list for module exports. It does not include any data processing, user input, network communication, or dynamic code execution. The module structure and naming are consistent with typical Python package design. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign module setup for a package, containing only standard import and export declarations without any malicious behavior or security concerns.",
