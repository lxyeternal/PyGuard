  "purpose": "Import statements for functions with obfuscated names from the 'unfoldNd' package modules, defining the public API.",
  "sources": "Static import statements from 'unfoldNd' modules, no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing, network activity, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A; code only imports functions and defines __all__, with no data flow or execution logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names that appear auto-generated or intentionally obscure; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers and an __all__ list. No dynamic execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. Obfuscation may be stylistic or for code protection but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports agree on the benign nature, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup with obfuscated function names, likely for stylistic or protective reasons. No security risks or malware are evident from this snippet.",
