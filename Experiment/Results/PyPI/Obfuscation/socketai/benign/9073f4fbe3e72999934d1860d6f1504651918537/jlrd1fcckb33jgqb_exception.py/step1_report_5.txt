  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named gKWedDUPuZELHAwaMVNzHKHYgfcrBhZR.",
  "sources": "No data sources or input reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, inputs, or outputs in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated and randomly generated, which can be suspicious. However, the class itself is a standard exception subclass with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with an intentionally obfuscated name. No data reading, processing, or external interactions are present. The class does not contain any methods or behavior that could be malicious. The obfuscated class name alone does not indicate malicious intent but warrants caution if found in a larger context. There are no signs of malware or security risks within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with an obfuscated name. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this isolated snippet.",
