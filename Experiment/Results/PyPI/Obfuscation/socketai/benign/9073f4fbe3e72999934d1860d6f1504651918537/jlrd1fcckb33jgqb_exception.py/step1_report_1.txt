  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named gKWedDUPuZELHAwaMVNzHKHYgfcrBhZR.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leak points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving external or untrusted sources or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated string; no meaningful naming or comments. The class itself is a straightforward exception subclass with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single exception class inheriting from Exception. The class name is unusual and likely obfuscated or randomly generated, which could suggest an attempt to hide its purpose. No other code, input handling, data processing, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The code is syntactically correct and minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, seemingly obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious intent or security risks. The unusual class name may indicate obfuscation, but it does not inherently imply malicious behavior.",
