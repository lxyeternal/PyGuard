  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named gKWedDUPuZELHAwaMVNzHKHYgfcrBhZR.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow since there are no operations or data handling in the code.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated and does not convey meaningful purpose; it is an unusually long, nonsensical string which may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent to hide purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There are no data inputs, outputs, or operations. The class itself does not perform any malicious actions, but the obfuscated naming raises suspicion about concealment or malicious intent. The code does not include any behavior that indicates malware, such as network activity or data exfiltration. Overall, it is minimal, but the obfuscated class name warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is extremely simple and does not directly contain malicious behavior. However, the obfuscated class name suggests potential concealment or malicious intent, warranting further scrutiny if part of a larger codebase. Based solely on this snippet, it appears benign but suspicious due to naming.",
