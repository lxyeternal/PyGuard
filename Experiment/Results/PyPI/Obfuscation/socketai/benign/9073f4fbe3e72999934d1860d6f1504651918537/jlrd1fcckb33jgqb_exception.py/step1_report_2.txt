  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition, likely used for handling specific error conditions in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No data input or external sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or data handling paths; this is a simple class declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a randomized or obfuscated string; no meaningful naming is used.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with a non-descriptive, obfuscated name. There are no operations, data handling, or suspicious behaviors. The class simply inherits from Exception and passes without additional logic. The naming suggests potential obfuscation, but this alone is not malicious. No input, output, or data flow is present. The code appears minimal and benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign class definition with an obfuscated name; no malicious intent or security issues are detected.",
