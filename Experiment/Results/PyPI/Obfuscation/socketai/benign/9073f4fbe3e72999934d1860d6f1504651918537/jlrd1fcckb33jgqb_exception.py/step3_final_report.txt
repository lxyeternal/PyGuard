{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, likely for use as a placeholder or in exception handling.",
  "sources": "Class definition, inherits from Exception, no input/output or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no network or file operations, no data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class is a simple inheritance with no methods or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name, minimal code, no additional logic or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class inheriting from Exception with an obfuscated name. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues are present. The obfuscated name could be suspicious but is not evidence of malicious intent. The code is syntactically correct and benign. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion due to naming but does not imply malicious activity. Malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. Security risk is minimal, given the simplicity and lack of external interactions. Confidence in benign assessment is high.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal exception class with an obfuscated name. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation warrants cautious handling but does not constitute a threat on its own.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
