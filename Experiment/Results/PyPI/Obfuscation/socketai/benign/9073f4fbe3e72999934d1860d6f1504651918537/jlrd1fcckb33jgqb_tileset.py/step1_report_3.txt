{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple data classes and named tuples for managing tile and sprite properties, likely used in a game or graphics application.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules and submodules, but primarily reads data from class and function definitions, including imported types.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file writing, or system commands are present that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input reaching sensitive sinks; data is stored or structured within class instances.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are observed. No obfuscation or dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and data structure definitions with type annotations and default values. It imports other modules but does not execute or invoke any functions or code that could be malicious. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file modification, or credential access are detected. The structure appears to be a typical setup for a game or graphical application managing tiles, images, and transformations.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be a benign set of data classes used for graphics or game asset management. No malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks are evident based on the code snippet.",
