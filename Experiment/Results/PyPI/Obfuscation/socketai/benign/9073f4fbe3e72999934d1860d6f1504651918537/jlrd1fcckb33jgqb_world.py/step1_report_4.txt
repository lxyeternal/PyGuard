{
  "purpose": "The code processes and loads map data from JSON files, applying regex patterns for filtering filenames, and constructs data structures for further use.",
  "sources": "The code reads JSON files from disk and processes filename patterns using regex.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure use of filenames and data from JSON, but no direct sink for untrusted data leading to code execution or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data is loaded from JSON -> filtered and processed via regex -> used to build data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic regex matching on filenames, but no evidence of hardcoded secrets or malicious obfuscation. The code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code loads JSON data from files, processes map entries, and applies regex filtering on filenames. It constructs map metadata structures with parameters from the JSON, including position and size info. No code injection, network communication, or suspicious file operations are present. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The regex filtering could be exploited if patterns are maliciously crafted, but within the context, it is a standard filtering mechanism. There are no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard data loading and processing script for map data, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behaviors. It performs file reading, JSON parsing, regex filtering, and data structure creation in a typical manner.",
