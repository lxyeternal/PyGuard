{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process and load map and pattern data from JSON files, potentially for a game or map editor, transforming this data into structured objects.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from JSON files (via open() and json.load), and from the filesystem (via listdir and isfile) for pattern matching.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak points include reading JSON files containing map data; however, there are no direct data leaks or system effects observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON files and filesystem patterns into in-memory objects, with no evident untrusted data being used in unsafe operations or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors are evident. The code uses regex pattern matching but in a controlled manner. No obfuscation or suspicious dynamic code execution is present.",
  "analysis": "The code securely reads JSON map data, processes map patterns, and constructs data objects without executing or evaluating untrusted code beyond controlled regex matching. No signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation are present. The code functions as a data loader and parser with standard file and JSON operations. The structure and logic are straightforward, with no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard data processing script with no malicious intent or security risks. It reads and processes map and pattern data safely. There are no indicators of malicious activity or sabotage. The risk is very low.",
