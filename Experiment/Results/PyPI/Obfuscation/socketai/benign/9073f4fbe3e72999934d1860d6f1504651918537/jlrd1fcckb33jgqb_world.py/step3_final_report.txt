{
  "purpose": "Parses map and pattern data from JSON files, applies regex filtering on filenames, and constructs data structures representing map configurations and patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads JSON files, accesses file names in directories, and processes pattern regex matches.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communications; primarily data parsing and structure creation.",
  "flows": "JSON data loaded from files -> pattern matching via regex -> data structure construction with offsets and scaling.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, unnecessary imports, and use of regex for filename filtering, but no malicious code or payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard JSON parsing, regex filtering, and data structure creation for map configurations. Obfuscated identifiers suggest code concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, code injection, or hardcoded secrets are present. The regex filtering is typical and not inherently dangerous. The code's purpose is benign, and no malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation impacts readability but not security. The malware score is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious payloads. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7-0.8) due to naming obfuscation, and the security risk score remains low (~0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign data loader with obfuscated identifiers, performing standard file and JSON processing. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity are present. The obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The overall security risk is low, and the current scoring reflects this appropriately.",
