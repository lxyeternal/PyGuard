{
  "purpose": "The code appears to parse and process map and pattern data from JSON files for further use, likely in a game or map editing context.",
  "sources": "File input in 'AmEZXeCKiwUApGQhHBOOHwURjQAgenPa' function reads from JSON files; data is loaded via json.load. Pattern matching uses regex on filenames in the directory.",
  "sinks": "Processed data is stored in data structures; no direct sinks such as network or system calls are evident. No output or external connections are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from JSON file into Python data structures, is processed with regex matching and calculations, then stored in class instances and returned.",
  "anomalies": "The code imports numerous modules and custom types, some of which are unused or irrelevant (e.g., 'attr', 'TypedDict'). The variable and class names are obfuscated, making understanding difficult. No obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors detected. No dangerous system or network calls are present.",
  "analysis": "The code reads map and pattern data from JSON files, processes pattern regexes to match filenames, and computes positional offsets and scales. It constructs map data structures accordingly. No suspicious network, system, or security-sensitive operations are present. Obfuscated identifiers and unnecessary imports are present, but they do not indicate malicious intent. The code performs standard file I/O, JSON parsing, regex matching, and data structure construction without evident malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a parser and processor for map and pattern data, with obfuscated identifiers but no malicious behavior. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security risks beyond potential code obfuscation. The overall security risk is low.",
