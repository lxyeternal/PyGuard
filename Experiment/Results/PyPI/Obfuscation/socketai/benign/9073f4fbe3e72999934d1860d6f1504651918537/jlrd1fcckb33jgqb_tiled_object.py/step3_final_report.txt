{
  "purpose": "The code defines data classes using the attrs library, primarily for data modeling purposes, with obfuscated class and import names.",
  "sources": "Import statements, class attribute definitions, and class inheritance structures.",
  "sinks": "No data flows to external sinks, no network or file operations, and no untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code is static data structure definitions; no active data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names and import aliases, which may suggest code concealment or proprietary obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions with no active logic, network activity, or data exfiltration. Obfuscated names are consistent but do not indicate malicious intent. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately low (0), with obfuscation scores justified by naming patterns. The code appears to be part of a data modeling layer, and no suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, mainly data structure definitions with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior or security threats is present. Obfuscation warrants cautious review in broader context but does not imply malicious intent based on this snippet.",
