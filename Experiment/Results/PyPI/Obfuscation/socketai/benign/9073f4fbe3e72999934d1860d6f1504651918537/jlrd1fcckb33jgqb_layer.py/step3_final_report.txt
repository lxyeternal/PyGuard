  "purpose": "Data class definitions for parsing tiled map objects and related structures.",
  "sources": "Class attribute initializations, type annotations, and imported modules related to data modeling.",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output, network communication, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows are limited to internal attribute assignments within class definitions; no external data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in class and attribute names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no suspicious code patterns or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions using 'attr' for modeling map and object properties. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscated naming conventions raise suspicion but do not indicate malicious intent. Malware score is appropriately set to 0; obfuscation score is high (~0.7) due to naming complexity; overall security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The initial high risk scores (0.9-1.0) in the reports are overestimations given the benign nature of the code. Adjusting the risk scores downward aligns better with the observed behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily data modeling for map parsing, with notable obfuscation in naming but no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score remains at 0; obfuscation is moderate; overall risk is minimal. The initial reports' high risk scores should be lowered to reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code.",
