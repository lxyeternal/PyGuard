  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily data modeling for map parsing, with notable obfuscation in naming but no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The malware score remains at 0; obfuscation is moderate; overall risk is minimal. The initial reports' high risk scores should be lowered to reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code."
