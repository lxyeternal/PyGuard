{
  "purpose": "Define data structures and classes for a tiled object parser, including properties and attributes relevant to 2D tile map processing.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (pathlib, typing), third-party libraries (attr, pytiled_parser modules), class attributes, and optional type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None identified explicitly. No data is being sent over the network, stored insecurely, or executed as code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code primarily defines classes and data structures without executing flows.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are present. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unusual variable names that indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions with clearly defined attributes for handling tile map objects. Usage of well-structured type hints and data classes suggests standard data modeling. No input sources such as network, file, or user input are directly processed here, and no data sinks or external communications are present. The import statements are standard and do not exhibit suspicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to serve as a structured data model for a larger application, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard data modeling for a tile parser, with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It does not contain obfuscated or malicious code and appears to be safe.",
