{
  "purpose": "Define data models and types related to tiled map objects, configurations, and properties used in a tile-based game or map parsing library.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attribute definitions, imported modules, and type annotations. No direct data input sources such as user input, network, or environment variables are present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as file writing, network transmission, or command execution are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are evident, as the code only defines data structures without processing or executing any data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code constructs are present. The import statements involve standard or third-party libraries related to data modeling. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution appears.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions using the 'attrs' library for data modeling. All attributes are type-annotated, with no functions, control flow, or data processing. Imported modules are used solely for type hints or data encapsulation. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification are detected. The structure appears to be a typical setup for parsing or handling map data. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of data model definitions for map object configurations with no evidence of malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain any input/output handling, external communications, or suspicious behaviors. The overall security risk is negligible.",
