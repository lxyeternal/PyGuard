{
  "purpose": "Define data classes and type annotations for a tiled map parsing library, possibly used for game development or map handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from external libraries (pathlib, typing, attr, pytiled_parser modules), class attribute definitions, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attribute definitions and type annotations without involving untrusted input or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation present. Code appears to be straightforward data structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several data classes with attributes, primarily for parsing or handling map objects, tiles, and related properties. Usage of third-party modules like 'attr' and 'pytiled_parser' is consistent with data modeling. No dynamic code execution, network access, or handling of untrusted input is observed. No suspicious patterns, such as embedded code, backdoors, or malicious logic, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard data model definitions used for map parsing or configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe and does not contain malware or obfuscated code.",
