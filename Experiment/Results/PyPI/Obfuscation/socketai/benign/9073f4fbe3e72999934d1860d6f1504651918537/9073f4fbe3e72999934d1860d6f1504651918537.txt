Obfuscation is likely intentional but does not compromise security. Scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall risk is minimal."

      "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign interface with obfuscated import names, likely auto-generated or intentionally obscured. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is present in this code fragment. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware risk remains minimal. Ongoing monitoring is recommended if further code reveals dynamic or network activity."

The high obfuscation level warrants caution if external modules are untrusted, but based solely on this snippet, the security risk is minimal."

The malware score remains at 0; obfuscation is moderate; overall risk is minimal. The initial reports' high risk scores should be lowered to reflect the benign and straightforward nature of the code."
