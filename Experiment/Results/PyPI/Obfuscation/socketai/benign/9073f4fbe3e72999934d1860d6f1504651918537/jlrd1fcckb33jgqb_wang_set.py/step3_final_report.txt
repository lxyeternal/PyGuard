  "purpose": "Static data class definitions with obfuscated names, no executable logic or external interactions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, type annotations, imported modules used solely for type hints.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, network, or file operations.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; purely structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, which could be an attempt to conceal intent but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data classes created with the 'attrs' library, with nonsensical or obfuscated names. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. Imports include obscure modules/classes used only for type annotations. No malicious code, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately low (0), reflecting no malicious behavior. Risk scores are minimal (~0.1), primarily due to obfuscation. Obfuscation scores are high (~0.7), justified by the naming style. Overall, the code appears benign and safe for use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated data class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, with low malware and risk scores, and a moderate obfuscation score reflecting the naming style. No changes are necessary.",
