  "purpose": "Define data structures using attrs for configuration or data management within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, class attributes, and potentially untrusted input data used in data classes.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; data is stored or passed within the program. No network or file operations shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources into class attributes; no direct flows to external systems or sinks are demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The import from a seemingly obscure module (pytiled_parser.common_types) could be benign or suspicious depending on context but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions with attributes that include types and optional fields. There is no execution of untrusted code, no network activity, and no handling of sensitive data or environment variables. The imported modules are standard or from a known parser library; no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns are present. The classes serve as data containers, and their design appears typical for structured data management. No indicators of malicious intent, sabotage, or security risks are visible within this code fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data classes with no evident malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be used for organizing data structures, likely as part of a larger application. No security risks or malware indications are observed based solely on this code.",
