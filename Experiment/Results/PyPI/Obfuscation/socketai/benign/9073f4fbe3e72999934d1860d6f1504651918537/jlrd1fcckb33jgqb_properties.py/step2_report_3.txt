  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code only declares type aliases and imports modules.\n- The custom type name `ZUTeajcHOlkWZKqCaCHGkEalzTVNUjRL` appears obfuscated or auto-generated.\n- No data processing, input/output, or runtime behavior is present.\n- No evidence of malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issues:\n\n- **Code correctness:** The code snippets are syntactically correct and consistent with the described purpose.\n- **Malicious behavior:** None of the reports find any malicious activity; scores for malware are zero.\n- **Obfuscation:** The only recurring concern is the obfuscated class name, which could be a red flag for code concealment or auto-generation, but on its own, it does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Potential vulnerabilities:** None are identified; the code is purely for type hinting.\n\n---\n\n### Scoring and Reasoning:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.8; this seems reasonable considering the unusual class name.\n- **Risk score:** All are 0 or very low, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n**However,** since the code is just type alias declarations, the **risk score** should arguably be **0** in all cases, unless obfuscation is considered a security concern, which is not necessarily true.\n\n---\n\n### Critical points:\n\n- The **obfuscated class name** alone does not indicate malicious intent but could hinder maintainability.\n- The **scores are consistent** with the analysis provided.\n- The **confidence levels** are high (0.8-0.9), reflecting the straightforward nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- **Adjust risk scores to 0** across all reports, as no security risk exists.\n- **Maintain malware scores at 0**, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscation concern** is valid but not a security risk per se; it should not inflate the security risk score.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n| Aspect            | Score (per report) | Justification                                              |\n|-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware           | 0                   | No malicious code or behavior present                        |\n| Obfuscated        | 0.2 - 0.8           | Obfuscated class name, but not malicious                     |\n| Security Risk     | 0                   | No vulnerabilities or malicious activity                     |\n\n**Overall,** the code is benign, and the only minor concern is the obfuscated naming, which does not translate into actual security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n- The code is a standard type alias declaration with no malicious behavior.\n- The obfuscated class name warrants attention but is not inherently malicious.\n- The current scores are reasonable but could be adjusted to reflect a **security risk of 0**.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nSet **securityRisk** to 0 and **malware** to 0 for all reports, with a **low obfuscation score** (around 0.2) to reflect the naming concern but not a security issue.",
