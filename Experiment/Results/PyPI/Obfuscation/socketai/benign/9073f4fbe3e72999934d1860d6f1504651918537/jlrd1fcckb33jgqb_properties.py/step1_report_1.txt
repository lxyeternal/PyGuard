{
  "purpose": "Defines type aliases for data structures using Union and Dict with various data types, including custom types.",
  "sources": "Imports from pathlib, typing, and a local module for custom type; no data reading or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or operations that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only establishes type aliases without runtime behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated or non-descriptive class name for a type alias, which may be a red flag, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares type aliases for later use in the program. No input reading, data processing, or system interactions are present. The only potentially suspicious element is the import of a custom type with a non-descriptive name, which could be obfuscation, but without further context, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard type alias declaration with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated class name does not indicate malicious intent by itself. Overall, the code is safe.",
