{
  "purpose": "The code defines type aliases for complex data structures involving various data types and a custom type imported from a local module.",
  "sources": "The code reads the imported module '.common_types' and defines type aliases using imported and built-in types.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data transmission points are present.",
  "flows": "The code only establishes type aliases; no data flow occurs during execution.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive, obfuscated-looking custom type name 'ZUTeajcHOlkWZKqCaCHGkEalzTVNUjRL'. No actual malicious code or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and custom types, then creates type aliases for complex data structures involving primitive types and the imported custom type. There is no data manipulation, no input/output handling, and no executable logic. The custom type name appears intentionally obfuscated or auto-generated, but its usage here does not indicate malicious intent. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple type alias definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated type name does not pose a threat within this context. Overall, the code is benign.",
