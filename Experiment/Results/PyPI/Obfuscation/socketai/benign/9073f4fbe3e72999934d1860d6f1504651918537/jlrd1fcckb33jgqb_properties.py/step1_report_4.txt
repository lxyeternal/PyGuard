  "purpose": "Define type aliases for various data structures and types used in the package",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; only type alias definitions and import statements",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or output",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; only type annotations and imports",
  "anomalies": "Use of a non-descriptive, obfuscated-looking custom type name; no apparent malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard library modules (Path, Dict, Union) and a local module. It defines a union type alias for common data types including a custom type. The custom type name appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The code lacks any data handling, input/output, or executable logic. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code injection is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign type alias definition intended for type hinting purposes within a larger package. There are no signs of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks.",
