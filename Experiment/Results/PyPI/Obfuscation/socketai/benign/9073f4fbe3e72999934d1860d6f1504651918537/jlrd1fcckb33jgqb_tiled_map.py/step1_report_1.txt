  "purpose": "Data structure definition for a tiled map parser using attributes and type annotations",
  "sources": "Import statements from standard libraries, third-party modules, and type annotations",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present; no external data output or input occurs within this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this is purely a data class definition",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or non-descriptive class and variable names, which could suggest obfuscation, but no malicious intent is evident; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are present",
  "analysis": "The code defines a data class with various attributes, including paths, booleans, lists, and optional fields, all related to a tiled map parser. Import statements are from known libraries and do not show signs of malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or sensitive data handling are present. The class is straightforward, serving as a data container with no apparent malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data structure definition for a map parser, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscated-looking class and variable names do not contribute to malicious intent but may hinder readability. Overall, it is benign.",
