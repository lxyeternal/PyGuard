  "purpose": "Defines a data class for a tiled map parser configuration, serving as a structured container for map attributes and properties.",
  "sources": "Module imports (pytiled_parser.*), class attribute definitions, and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Data is statically assigned to class attributes; no runtime data flow or external data handling occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated module and variable names; no runtime logic or dynamic code execution; only data definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static data class with obfuscated naming, imported modules are legitimate but their names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation. No functions, I/O, network activity, or dynamic code are present. The obfuscation may be for proprietary or code-hiding reasons but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is zero, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior. The risk score is low, reflecting no vulnerabilities or malicious activity. The obfuscation score is higher due to the obfuscated names but justified. Overall, the code is benign, serving as a structured data container with no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data class definition for map configuration, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. Obfuscation is likely intentional but does not compromise security. Scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall risk is minimal.",
