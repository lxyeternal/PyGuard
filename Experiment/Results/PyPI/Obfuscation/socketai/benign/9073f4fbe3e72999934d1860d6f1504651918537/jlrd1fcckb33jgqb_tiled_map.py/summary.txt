  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated data class definition for map configuration, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. Obfuscation is likely intentional but does not compromise security. Scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall risk is minimal."
