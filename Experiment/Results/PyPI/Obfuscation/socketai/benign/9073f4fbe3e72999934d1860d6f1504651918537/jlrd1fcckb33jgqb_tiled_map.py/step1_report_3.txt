{
  "purpose": "Defines a data structure (class) representing a map or layer configuration, including various properties and references to external types.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (pathlib, typing) and multiple external modules (pytiled_parser.common_types, layer, properties, tileset). The class constructor initializes attributes with data types and default values.",
  "sinks": "None present; code only defines data structures and imports modules without performing data processing or I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only declares a class with attributes, no runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or dynamic code execution. The imports are from known libraries, and the class contains only data attributes.",
  "analysis": "The code imports multiple modules and defines a class with strongly typed attributes, including optional and default values. No functions, input handling, or runtime logic is present that could be exploited or contain malicious behavior. The structure appears standard for configuration or data modeling in Python. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leakage mechanisms are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward data class definition with imports from well-known libraries. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within the provided code segment.",
