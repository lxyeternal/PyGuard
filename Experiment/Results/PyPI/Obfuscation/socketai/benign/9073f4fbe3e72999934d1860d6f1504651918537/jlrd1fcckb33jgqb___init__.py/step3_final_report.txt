  "purpose": "Import statements for various modules related to map, tileset, world, and properties handling in a mapping or game engine library.",
  "sources": "Local module imports with obfuscated or nonsensical names, no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; no network, file, or system calls detected.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; no runtime data flow or execution beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and symbol names, which are unusual and could be used to hide malicious code or sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and an __all__ list, with no executable logic. The imported symbols have obfuscated names, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No signs of network activity, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscation could be for proprietary or auto-generated code, but it warrants caution. The malware scores are zero or very low, aligning with the absence of direct malicious activity. The obfuscation scores are high, reflecting suspicion. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation warrants continued vigilance. The confidence in the benign nature is high, given the lack of suspicious behavior in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This module appears to be a benign interface with obfuscated import names, likely auto-generated or intentionally obscured. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is present in this code fragment. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware risk remains minimal. Ongoing monitoring is recommended if further code reveals dynamic or network activity.",
