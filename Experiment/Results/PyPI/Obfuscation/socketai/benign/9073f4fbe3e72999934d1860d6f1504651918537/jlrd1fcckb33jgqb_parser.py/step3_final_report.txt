  "purpose": "Functions for loading and parsing map, tileset, and world data in JSON or TMX formats, supporting format detection and exception handling.",
  "sources": "File input via open(), format detection via osCvpDhyjolxuFREGzdIhoQBFoNnUwZl, data reading from files.",
  "sinks": "No data is written or transmitted externally; only file reads and parsing occur.",
  "flows": "File is read, format is detected, then parsed with appropriate external parser functions based on format.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and class names, minor typo in exception message ('Unknowm'), superficial obfuscation of identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs file reading and format detection for map and tileset data, utilizing external parsers with obfuscated names. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hinder static analysis but not malicious. Exception handling is standard, and the logic is straightforward. Given the lack of malicious indicators, the code seems to serve as a utility for map loading.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate map and tileset loader with superficial obfuscation. No signs of supply chain attack, malware, or malicious intent are evident. The high obfuscation level warrants caution if external modules are untrusted, but based solely on this snippet, the security risk is minimal.",
