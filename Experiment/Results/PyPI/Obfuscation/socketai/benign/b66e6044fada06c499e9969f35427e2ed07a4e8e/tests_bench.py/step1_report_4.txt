  "purpose": "Generate a synthetic FASTA file with repetitive sequences and read a subset of sequences from it.",
  "sources": "Reading input files (the FASTA file), using random number generation for index selection.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; file writing and in-memory data handling are typical.",
  "flows": "Generating sequences -> writing to file -> reading file into Fasta object -> random reads from sequences.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded seed for randomness, no dynamic or external inputs affecting core logic; no suspicious code paths or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code creates a synthetic FASTA file with repetitive sequences, then reads and processes some sequences from it. The use of a fixed seed ensures reproducibility. There are no indications of malicious code such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code performs standard file I/O and sequence processing. No suspicious code structures, obfuscation, or secret credentials are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be benign, designed for testing or data generation purposes. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. The overall security risk score is low.",
