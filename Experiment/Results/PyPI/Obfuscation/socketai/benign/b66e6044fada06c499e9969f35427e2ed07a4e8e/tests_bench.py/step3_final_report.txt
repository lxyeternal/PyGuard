  "purpose": "Generate a synthetic FASTA file with repetitive sequences, then read and process it for performance measurement.",
  "sources": "Reading sequence data from the generated FASTA file; sequence slicing using random indices.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Sequence data is generated, written to file, then read into pyfasta.Fasta object; random slicing occurs within the code.",
  "anomalies": "Superficial variable obfuscation; use of fixed random seed; repetitive sequence data; no input validation or error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code generates a FASTA file with repetitive sequences ('ACTGACTGAC') using a fixed seed for reproducibility, then reads it into a pyfasta.Fasta object. It performs random slicing of sequences without external communication or malicious behavior. Variable names are obfuscated but the logic is straightforward. No external data leaks, network activity, or malicious modifications are evident. The use of fixed seed and repetitive data is typical for testing scripts, not malicious intent. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.2-0.3, securityRisk ~0.2) are consistent with the benign, testing-oriented nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign synthetic data generator and processor with no malicious or security-critical behavior. Obfuscation is superficial, and no malicious activity is detected. The assigned low scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's purpose.",
