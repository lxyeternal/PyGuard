  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated test suite for pyfasta with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and typical of testing environments, and the code operates solely on local files with no external communication. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is moderate (~0.3), and the overall security risk is very low (~0.15)."
