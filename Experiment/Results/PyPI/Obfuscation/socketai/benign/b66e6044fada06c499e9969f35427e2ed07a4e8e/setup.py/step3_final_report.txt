  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata, entry points, and build commands.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated variable assignments, setup() parameters, package data, entry points, and import statements.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution of 'pyfasta' module via console script; obfuscated strings could hide malicious code.",
  "flows": "Obfuscated variables define package metadata; entry point executes 'pyfasta:main'; no direct malicious flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical variable names, obfuscated strings for package name and version, malformed setup arguments, suspicious variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code is a setup script with heavy obfuscation, nonsensical variable names, and suspicious parameter values. No explicit malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation and malformed arguments could be used to hide malicious intent, but on their own, they do not confirm malicious behavior. The empty reports provide no additional context. The setup's structure suggests potential concealment, warranting caution but not definitive maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The script exhibits signs of obfuscation and suspicious parameter values, raising concerns about potential malicious intent. However, no concrete malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident from the code alone. Further dynamic analysis or source verification is recommended before deployment.",
