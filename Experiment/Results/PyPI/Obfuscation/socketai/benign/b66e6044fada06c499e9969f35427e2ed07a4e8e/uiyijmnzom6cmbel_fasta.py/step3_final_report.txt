  "purpose": "A Python class for parsing and manipulating FASTA files, providing sequence retrieval, slicing, and complement operations.",
  "sources": "File reads for sequence data, header lines starting with '>'",
  "sinks": "Returns sequence data, headers, and sequence slices; no external network or system modifications",
  "flows": "Input file reading -> header parsing -> sequence data accumulation -> sequence slicing and complement operations",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; no suspicious external activity or malicious code evident",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard FASTA parsing with sequence extraction, header management, and sequence complement functions. Obfuscated variable names hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code handles sequence slicing and strand orientation correctly. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The malware score is justified as 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, obfuscated FASTA parser with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation likely serves to conceal implementation details rather than to perform malicious actions. The security risk is low, and the malware score remains at 0.",
