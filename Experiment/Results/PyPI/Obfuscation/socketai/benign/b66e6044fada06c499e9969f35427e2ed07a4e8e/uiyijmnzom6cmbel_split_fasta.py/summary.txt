  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate bioinformatics utility for FASTA file splitting. Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The low malware score is justified, and the overall security risk remains minimal. Caution is advised if deploying in untrusted environments due to obfuscation, but the current analysis indicates benign functionality."
