{
  "purpose": "The code provides command-line utilities for FASTA file processing, including extracting sequence info, splitting files, flattening files in-place, and calculating GC content.",
  "sources": "User input arguments, external modules (`fasta`, `records`, `split_fasta`), and file paths provided as command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "File operations (reading/writing FASTA files), in-place file modification, sequence data processing; no network or system modification observed.",
  "flows": "Input arguments trigger functions that read FASTA files, process sequences, and output information; data flows from file reads through sequence analysis to console output.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated function and variable names, which may be intended to hide code intent but are not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard bioinformatics tasks: parsing FASTA files, calculating sequence lengths and GC content, splitting files, and in-place flattening. Obfuscated naming raises suspicion but no malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage is evident. The code relies on external modules assumed to be legitimate. The functions are typical for bioinformatics workflows, and no suspicious patterns like eval, exec, or hidden backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate bioinformatics utility with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. Obfuscation is notable but not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The overall security risk is low, with the main concern being the obfuscation which warrants cautious review if sourced from untrusted origins.",
