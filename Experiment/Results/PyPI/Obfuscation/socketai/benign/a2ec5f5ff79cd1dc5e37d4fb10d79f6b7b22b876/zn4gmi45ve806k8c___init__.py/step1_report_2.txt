{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from the 'partial' module, likely for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package's 'partial' module",
  "sinks": "Potentially none directly; import statements can be benign but may hide malicious behavior if imported items are malicious",
  "flows": "Imported symbols are assigned local names; no data flow or untrusted data handling evident",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated symbol names for imported items, which could suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent or functionality",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing symbols with highly obfuscated names from a local module named 'partial'. The naming pattern indicates obfuscation, which can sometimes be used to hide malicious code. There are no explicit signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity or data exfiltration. However, the obscured naming and lack of context raise suspicion about potential concealment. The code is minimal and structurally simple, making it difficult to determine intent beyond obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs obfuscated imports from a local module, which may be an attempt to conceal malicious intent or sensitive functionality. While no explicit malicious actions are evident, the heavy obfuscation warrants caution.",
