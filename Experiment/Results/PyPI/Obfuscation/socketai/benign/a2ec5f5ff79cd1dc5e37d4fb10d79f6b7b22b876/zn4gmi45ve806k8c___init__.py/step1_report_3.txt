  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local module 'partial' using obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "Imports from the module '.partial'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as data output, network connections, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only module import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated import names; no meaningful identifiers; no additional code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements from a local module '.partial', importing entities with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. There are no functions, data processing, or other logic. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide the purpose or contents of these imports, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications. The absence of executable code beyond imports limits potential malicious activity. This pattern could be used to hide functionality but, on its own, is not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely performs obfuscated imports with no additional logic or behavior indicative of malicious activity. The high obfuscation could be suspicious but does not directly imply malicious intent. Overall, no malicious behavior is evident.",
