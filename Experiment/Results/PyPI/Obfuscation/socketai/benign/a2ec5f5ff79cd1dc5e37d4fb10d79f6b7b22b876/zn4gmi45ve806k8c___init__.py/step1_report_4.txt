{
  "purpose": "Import specific components from the local 'partial' module, likely for internal use within the package.",
  "sources": "The module imports 'ZLKvMTcGYEGHMTgQFCxtZsMDpNksNsum' and 'SWOUXthJdXRnExgtfjsocuwmXuwmGLvR' from the same local 'partial' module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows to external systems, network, or untrusted sources are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; just internal imports.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are long, nonsensical, and appear to be obfuscated or auto-generated, which could indicate obfuscation or hiding intentions. No actual code logic, data manipulation, or network activities are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from a local module, importing two objects with obfuscated or nonsensical names. No additional code, data handling, or behavior is visible. The naming pattern suggests possible obfuscation or auto-generated code, but there is no indication of malicious intent such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, merely importing internal components with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
