  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules named 'partial'.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from local modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; standard import operations.",
  "flows": "Import statements facilitate access to internal modules; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Imports are named with seemingly random or obfuscated names; no actual code or data processing observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing entities with long, nonsensical or obfuscated names from a local module 'partial'. These imports are typical for internal package structure. There is no evidence of code execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior. The naming pattern might suggest obfuscation or minification, but this alone is not malicious. No sources, sinks, or data flows indicating malicious activity are present. The code appears to be standard module import statements with obfuscated names, which might be a result of code obfuscation or automatic name mangling.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code performs standard local imports with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on the limited snippet. The code is likely part of a larger, potentially obfuscated module structure. No malicious activity is evident.",
