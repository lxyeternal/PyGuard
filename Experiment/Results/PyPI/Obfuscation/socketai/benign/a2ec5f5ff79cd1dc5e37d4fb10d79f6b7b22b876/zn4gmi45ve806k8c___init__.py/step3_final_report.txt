{
  "purpose": "The code performs internal imports from a local module 'partial' using obfuscated or auto-generated names, with no additional logic or behavior.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing entities from '.partial' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external communication present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow or execution beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated or nonsensical import names; absence of other code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing obfuscated entities from a local module. No executable code, data handling, network activity, or malicious indicators are present. The heavy obfuscation of import names could be used for internal code concealment or minification, but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The lack of additional code or behavior limits the ability to identify malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation warrants caution, but in isolation, the code appears benign. The scores should reflect low malware likelihood, high obfuscation, and minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation, with heavy obfuscation of import names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities within this limited context. The obfuscation suggests caution, but without further evidence, the overall security risk remains low.",
