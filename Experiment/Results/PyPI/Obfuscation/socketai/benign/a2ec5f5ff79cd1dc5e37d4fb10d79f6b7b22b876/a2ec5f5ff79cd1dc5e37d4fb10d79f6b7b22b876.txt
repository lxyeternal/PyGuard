      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation, with heavy obfuscation of import names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities within this limited context. The obfuscation suggests caution, but without further evidence, the overall security risk remains low."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign compatibility utility with obfuscated identifiers. No signs of malicious activity are present, but the external utility function warrants further review. The obfuscation could be for version compatibility or to hinder static analysis, not necessarily malicious. Overall, the security risk is low, with a minimal malware likelihood, primarily due to obfuscation and external dependency."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated utility for dynamic Pydantic model creation, with no explicit malicious activity detected. However, the obfuscation and dynamic features pose a potential security risk if misused. Scores should reflect high obfuscation (around 0.75) but low malware likelihood (around 0.1-0.2). Overall, it warrants cautious review before deployment, especially in security-sensitive contexts."
