{
  "purpose": "A function returning a list of imported FastAPI router objects, likely for API setup.",
  "sources": "Imports from a local module '.data' and the router variables within the function.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any data leaks.",
  "flows": "The function simply returns a list of router objects; no data flow from sources to sinks is present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated variable and function names, which may be superficial or auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward FastAPI router aggregator with obfuscated names. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely due to code generation or stylistic choice. No malicious patterns, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are present. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a router collection function with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation does not impact the security posture significantly.",
