  "purpose": "Define a function that returns a list of FastAPI routers imported from various modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.data' module, function parameters, and module attributes such as 'WVghJMhAYOKDUkkYnscDqCIUDJnOvnkQ'.",
  "sinks": "The returned list of router objects may be used elsewhere in the application, but there are no direct sinks like network calls or file writes in this code.",
  "flows": "The function creates a list of imported router objects and returns them; data flows from imported modules to the return value.",
  "anomalies": "Unusually named variables and functions (e.g., 'STqwaOSCIYHgVwsKLdwoAdgKTiGzFAxM', 'WVghJMhAYOKDUkkYnscDqCIUDJnOvnkQ') suggest obfuscation. No dynamic execution or hardcoded secrets are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific routers from a local module and defines a function that returns these routers as a list. Variable and function names are deliberately obfuscated, which is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. No data input handling, network activity, or secret data is present. The code's purpose appears to be to aggregate and expose router objects, typical in FastAPI applications. The obfuscation could be a benign code style or an attempt to hide intent, but there is no explicit malicious activity detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward router aggregator with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident from this snippet alone. The obfuscation warrants cautious review, but there is no immediate sign of malware or security risk.",
