{
  "purpose": "The code defines a function that returns a list of FastAPI router objects imported from a local module for API endpoint registration.",
  "sources": "Imports from the local module '.data' and the function's return statement referencing variables from the imported routers.",
  "sinks": "Function return statement where the list of router variables is assembled and returned.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and straightforward; the function constructs a list from imported router variables and returns it.",
  "anomalies": "Router variables have obfuscated-looking names (e.g., WVghJMhAYOKDUkkYnscDqCIUDJnOvnkQ), but they are used in a simple list; no dynamic code execution or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific router objects from a local module and returns them in a list through a function. The variable names appear to be intentionally obfuscated or auto-generated, but there is no evidence of malicious code or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The code structure is straightforward and typical for FastAPI route registration. No hidden or suspicious operations are present. The obfuscated variable names may be a code-generation artifact rather than an attack vector.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple router aggregation function for FastAPI with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial and not indicative of malicious intent.",
