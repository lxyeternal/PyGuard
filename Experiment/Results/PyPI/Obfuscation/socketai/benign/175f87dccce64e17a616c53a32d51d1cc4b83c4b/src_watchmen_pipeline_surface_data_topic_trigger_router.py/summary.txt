  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard admin API endpoints for pipeline management, with high obfuscation but no signs of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears legitimate, and no immediate security threats are present."
