  "purpose": "API endpoints for rerunning pipelines, handling logs, and schema retrieval, primarily for administrative functions.",
  "sources": "User input parameters, environment variables, service calls to fetch schemas, logs, and generate IDs.",
  "sinks": "Pipeline trigger functions, schema lookups, log retrieval, and data flow into pipeline execution.",
  "flows": "Input validation → schema retrieval → pipeline trigger → log creation and execution.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation in variable and function names (e.g., lmNtcoInbybzQtzLpSHNTvuPqICmApFi), dynamic ID generation, no hardcoded secrets or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides administrative API endpoints for rerunning data pipelines and logs, with role-based access control indicated by tags. Obfuscated naming appears to be a superficial concealment tactic rather than malicious intent. No evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors. Validation and role checks are in place. The flow is standard for such management functions. The obfuscation reduces readability but does not inherently imply malicious behavior. The logic is consistent, and no security vulnerabilities are evident in the provided snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of standard admin API endpoints for pipeline management, with high obfuscation but no signs of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the overall security risk is low (~0.2). The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears legitimate, and no immediate security threats are present.",
