  "purpose": "Configuration management for messaging system connectors (RabbitMQ and Kafka).",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from class properties and constants.",
  "sinks": "Potentially used to initialize messaging clients which could connect to external systems.",
  "flows": "Configuration values flow from class attributes into connector initialization functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets (passwords, credentials) are visible; the code uses configuration variables. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution. The code appears standard for setting up messaging configurations.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a settings class with various configuration parameters for RabbitMQ and Kafka, including host, port, username, password, and other options. It then initializes a singleton configuration object. Functions check whether certain connectors are enabled and return configuration objects or flags accordingly. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or hidden malicious code. The use of configuration variables and external connector classes appears typical for a messaging setup. No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated logic are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration module for messaging system connectors without any signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application infrastructure setup, with no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected.",
