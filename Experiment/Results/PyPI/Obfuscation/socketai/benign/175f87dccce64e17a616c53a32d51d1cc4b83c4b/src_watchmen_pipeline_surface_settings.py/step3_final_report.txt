  "purpose": "Configuration setup for message brokers (RabbitMQ and Kafka), managing connection parameters and utility functions.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration parameters from class attributes, including host, port, username, password, and topic strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external effects observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters are read from class attributes and passed to connector constructors; no untrusted input flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but this does not imply malicious intent; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is standard configuration for message broker connections, with no signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or network abuse. Obfuscation appears stylistic. No untrusted input processing or dynamic code execution is present. The malware score is correctly zero; obfuscation is moderate but not malicious; risk score is low, justified by benign configuration. The overall structure and logic are straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code for message queue and streaming services, with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the current scoring accurately reflects the code's nature.",
