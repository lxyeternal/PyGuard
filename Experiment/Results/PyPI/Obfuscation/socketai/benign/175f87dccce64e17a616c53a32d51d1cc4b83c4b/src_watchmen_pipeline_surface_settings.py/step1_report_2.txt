  "purpose": "Configuration and utility functions for message broker connectors (RabbitMQ and Kafka) in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration values from the 'NmlcoSoMXIOfEefFsjMLjJJGlAPvxRqq' settings object, environment variables (potentially via ExtendedBaseSettings).",
  "sinks": "Returns connector objects and configuration settings; no direct data output or data leak mechanisms identified.",
  "flows": "Configuration values are read from the settings object and used to instantiate connector classes, which are then returned by functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no explicit hardcoded credentials, secrets, or sensitive data within this code snippet; functions use potentially external data sources; no suspicious code injections, code execution, or network activities are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines configuration classes and functions to instantiate message broker connector objects. It utilizes a settings singleton to retrieve connection parameters for Kafka and RabbitMQ, then constructs connector instances accordingly. No user input, untrusted data, or environment variables are directly used in a way that suggests malicious behavior. The variable naming appears intentionally obfuscated but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network communication outside intended connector creation, or backdoor code.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a configuration setup for message brokers with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The obfuscated variable names are likely for code obfuscation or stylistic purposes but do not imply malicious intent. No security risks or malware signals identified within this code snippet.",
