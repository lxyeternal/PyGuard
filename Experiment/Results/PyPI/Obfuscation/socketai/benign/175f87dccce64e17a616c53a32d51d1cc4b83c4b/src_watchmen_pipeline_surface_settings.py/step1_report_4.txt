  "purpose": "Configuration management for messaging connectors (RabbitMQ and Kafka) using environment-based settings",
  "sources": "Reads configuration variables from class attributes and environment or default values",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or outputs that handle untrusted data; primarily configuration setup",
  "flows": "Configuration attributes are accessed and used to initialize messaging connector objects without processing untrusted input",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets or credentials are present; code appears to dynamically set parameters from external configuration",
  "analysis": "The code defines configuration classes and functions that return settings for Kafka and RabbitMQ connectors. No user input or external data streams are processed directly. The functions retrieve configuration data, splitting Kafka topics if necessary, but do not execute or evaluate untrusted input. The imported modules and class attributes are used solely for configuration purposes. No suspicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The functions and classes follow standard practices for configuration handling without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration setup for messaging systems, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not handle untrusted input directly and relies on external configuration management. Overall, it appears safe with no evidence of supply chain attacks or malware.",
