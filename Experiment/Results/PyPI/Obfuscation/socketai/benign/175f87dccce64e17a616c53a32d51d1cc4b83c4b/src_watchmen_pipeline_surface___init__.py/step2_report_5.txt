  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the actual code snippet.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .main import STqwaOSCIYHgVwsKLdwoAdgKTiGzFAxM\nfrom .surface import lTjGAWPKURphpzZcciSzHaSDtLQjnCDb, dYjtgheMxnurbvOGmqtNciURbobdkLTZ\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code only performs relative imports from internal modules `.main` and `.surface`.\n- The imported identifiers are long, nonsensical strings, which are suspicious and suggest obfuscation.\n- There are **no direct data flows**, network calls, or other suspicious operations visible here.\n- The actual behavior depends on the content of the imported modules, which are not provided.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated import names, no immediate malicious activity, further review needed.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.2 (low, reasonable)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 (high, reasonable)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (low, reasonable)\n- **Comments:** The reasoning aligns with the code. No issues here.\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated identifiers, suspicion of obfuscation or malicious intent, further review recommended.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.2 (reasonable)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 (reasonable)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.2 (reasonable)\n- **Comments:** Similar to Report 1, appropriate.\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated names, suspicion of hiding malicious behavior, further review needed.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.2 (low, reasonable)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 (reasonable)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.4 (slightly higher, but still plausible given obfuscation)\n- **Comments:** Slightly higher security risk score is acceptable due to the obfuscation pattern.\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated import names, no malicious activity evident, further review needed.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0 (no malware suspected)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.7 (reasonable)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0 (no risk apparent)\n- **Comments:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated identifiers, potential concealment of malicious code, caution advised.\n- **Scores:** \n  - Malware: 0.4 (higher, reflecting suspicion)\n  - Obfuscated: 0.8 (high, reasonable)\n  - SecurityRisk: 0.4 (moderate)\n- **Comments:** Given the obfuscation, a higher malware score is justified, especially if the imported modules are untrusted.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n- All reports correctly identify the obfuscation pattern.\n- The malware scores are generally low (0.2) to moderate (0.4), which is reasonable considering only import statements.\n- The security risk scores vary slightly but are generally aligned with the suspicion level.\n- No report claims definitive malicious activity based solely on these import statements; they all recommend further review of the imported modules.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code itself does not show malicious behavior; the suspicion arises solely from obfuscated identifiers.\n- The malware scores could be slightly increased if the modules are from untrusted sources, but with only import statements, it's prudent to keep them low.\n- The obfuscation scores are high across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0.2 to 0.3 (since no direct malicious activity is observed, only suspicion)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.8 (consistent with the obfuscated identifiers)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 to 0.3 (low, unless further context indicates otherwise)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current reports are well-aligned with the evidence. The obfuscation is the main concern, but without further details, the risk remains low. The scores should stay as they are, with perhaps a slight increase in malware suspicion if the modules are from untrusted sources.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- The code is obfuscated but does not demonstrate malicious behavior on its own.  \n- Further review of the imported modules is necessary to determine if malicious code exists.  \n- The scores given are reasonable; I would maintain or slightly adjust them based on trustworthiness of the modules.",
