  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules within a package.",
  "sources": "The code imports from relative modules '.main' and '.surface'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no data processing or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable in this minimal import structure; source-to-sink paths are not applicable here.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are long, obfuscated-looking strings, which could suggest obfuscation or concealment, but this is not definitive. No other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward relative imports of modules within a package, importing specific classes or functions with seemingly obfuscated names. There is no execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior present. The obfuscated names could be an attempt to conceal intent, but without additional context, it remains speculative. The snippet is minimal and does not include any malicious patterns or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with obfuscated identifiers; no malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this fragment. The obfuscated names may warrant further context, but based on this snippet alone, there is no indication of malware or security issues.",
