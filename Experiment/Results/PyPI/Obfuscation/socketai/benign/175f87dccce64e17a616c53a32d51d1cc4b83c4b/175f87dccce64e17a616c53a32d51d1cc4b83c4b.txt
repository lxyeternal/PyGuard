No signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are present. Obfuscation is notable but not necessarily malicious. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible. Routine monitoring is advised, especially for obfuscation patterns, but no immediate security concerns are identified."

The main concerns are obfuscation and error handling patterns, which should be monitored. Scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.3."
