  "purpose": "Import specific symbols from local modules 'kafka' and 'rabbitmq' within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'kafka' and 'rabbitmq'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only imports symbols, no data sinks or output actions are present.",
  "flows": "Imported symbols are used elsewhere in the codebase; no direct source-to-sink flow within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear as random strings, which may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No meaningful names or documented purposes. The identifiers do not match typical function or variable naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing seemingly random identifiers from local modules. The identifiers do not resemble standard function or variable names and appear as obfuscated strings. The import statements themselves are benign syntax; however, the use of random identifiers could be a tactic to hide malicious behavior or simply obfuscate code intent. There is no evidence of data leakage, malicious payload, or suspicious network activity directly observable from these lines. Without additional context or the content of 'kafka' and 'rabbitmq' modules, it is difficult to definitively determine malicious intent. The pattern of importing seemingly random symbols warrants caution, as it may be used to conceal malicious functions or backdoors in the larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code only contains import statements with identifiers that appear obfuscated or nonsensical, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious concealment. There is no explicit malicious behavior observed here, but the suspicious naming warrants further investigation of the imported modules. Overall, the snippet by itself is low risk but should be examined in the broader context.",
