  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from local modules named 'kafka' and 'rabbitmq'.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.kafka' and '.rabbitmq' modules, likely reading module attributes or functions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or exported; import statements are safe by default.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random, non-descriptive identifiers (eswQlSvwcENLovzSkPzEhCeQniaXDXLM, HmpQwFKZDcZKwqMrGbboeAytqFjxvcJm, PAuszdNUIzWZMRDjOhQKxOOSdAJAmARA, xDzwFbpLolnXeYtlHWgRCrvifesfBzvr) instead of meaningful names; these could be placeholders or obfuscation. The code is minimal, with no logic or context.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules with non-descriptive attribute names, which could be placeholders or obfuscated identifiers. There are no operations, data processing, or control flow, making it difficult to infer malicious intent directly. However, the use of non-descriptive, seemingly random identifiers raises suspicion of obfuscation or concealment. No suspicious data flows, external network activity, or other malicious patterns are evident in this minimal snippet. The lack of context limits definitive conclusions, but the identifiers are atypical and warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is limited to import statements with obscure attribute names, which could suggest obfuscation or placeholder code. There are no explicit signs of malicious behavior, but the non-descriptive identifiers merit further review if this code is part of a larger, potentially obfuscated codebase. No active malicious activity is evident in this snippet.",
