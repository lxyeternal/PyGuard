{
  "purpose": "Static import of modules with obfuscated identifiers, likely auto-generated or obfuscated code, with no active malicious behavior evident.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'kafka' and 'rabbitmq' reading obfuscated symbols.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; static imports do not establish data flow paths.",
  "anomalies": "Identifiers are nonsensical and highly obfuscated, suggesting obfuscation or auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements with obfuscated names, indicating potential code obfuscation or auto-generation. No dynamic behaviors, network activity, or data handling are evident. The identifiers' appearance raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.1, obfuscated ~0.6-0.7, risk ~0.2) are consistent with the static, benign-looking nature of the code. The lack of evidence for malicious activity supports low malware and risk scores. Obfuscation is notable but not necessarily malicious, warranting further review of the imported modules for confirmation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears obfuscated but benign, with no active malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation may serve to conceal internal implementation details but does not indicate malicious intent based solely on this snippet. Scores are appropriate; further investigation of the modules is recommended for comprehensive security assessment.",
