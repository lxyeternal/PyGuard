{
  "purpose": "Import specific identifiers from local modules 'kafka' and 'rabbitmq'.",
  "sources": "Imports occur at the start of the code, indicating data or code being imported from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external system calls are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only local imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Imports use obfuscated-looking identifiers that appear as random strings, which could be suspicious. The code lacks context, such as usage or further logic.",
  "analysis": "The code solely imports symbols with seemingly random names from local modules. There are no apparent data inputs, user inputs, or network activity. The use of obscured identifiers without additional context could be an attempt to hide malicious functionality, but as-is, the code doesn't perform any operations or contain malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which could be suspicious but do not inherently indicate malicious behavior without further context. It likely is part of a larger codebase. No malware or malicious activity is evident from this fragment alone.",
