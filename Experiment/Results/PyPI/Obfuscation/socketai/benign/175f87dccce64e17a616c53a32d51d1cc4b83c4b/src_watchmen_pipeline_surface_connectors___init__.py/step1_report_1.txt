  "purpose": "Import specific identifiers from local modules 'kafka' and 'rabbitmq'.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading module attributes (likely strings or other objects) from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that involve untrusted input or output; purely static imports.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as the code only imports symbols from local modules without processing data at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear as random strings; no contextual explanation or documentation. No dynamic code execution or obfuscated patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific identifiers from modules 'kafka' and 'rabbitmq'. The identifiers are named with seemingly random strings, which could suggest obfuscation or autogenerated code. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code execution. The imports are static, with no apparent suspicious side effects. The random strings could be placeholders or part of a code generation process, but their presence alone is not suspicious. No sensitive data or credentials are hardcoded, and no external data sources or sinks are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple import statements with obfuscated identifier names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on these lines. The random naming could be part of code obfuscation or auto-generation but does not indicate malicious intent.",
