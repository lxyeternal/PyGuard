{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific identifiers from local modules 'kafka' and 'rabbitmq', likely for internal use within a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads from local modules ('kafka' and 'rabbitmq') within the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or external output observed in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only performs static imports without dynamic or external data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are long, seemingly random strings or obfuscated names, which may suggest obfuscation or hidden intentions; no other anomalies such as hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static import statements of variables with non-descriptive, seemingly random names from internal modules. There are no dynamic code execution, network calls, or data handling. The naming pattern raises suspicion of obfuscation, but without additional context, it remains unclear if malicious intent exists. No malicious actions are evident in this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple import statement that, due to the non-descriptive, random variable names, could potentially be obfuscated. No direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is present based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation level warrants further review of the entire codebase.",
