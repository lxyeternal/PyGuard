  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and assess the validity of their conclusions, scores, and potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .kafka import eswQlSvwcENLovzSkPzEhCeQniaXDXLM, HmpQwFKZDcZKwqMrGbboeAytqFjxvcJm\nfrom .rabbitmq import PAuszdNUIzWZMRDjOhQKxOOSdAJAmARA, xDzwFbpLolnXeYtlHWgRCrvifesfBzvr\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code performs static imports from local modules `kafka` and `rabbitmq`.\n- The imported identifiers are long, seemingly random strings.\n- No functions, data processing, or dynamic code execution are present.\n- The naming pattern suggests obfuscation or autogenerated code, not necessarily malicious.\n- No external network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is evident.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Score:**\n  - Obfuscated: 0.6\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Correctly notes the random names and lack of malicious behavior.\n  - No evidence of malware or malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Scores seem reasonable.\n  - The low malware and security risk scores are justified.\n- **Conclusion:**\n  - The report is cautious but reasonable, emphasizing the obfuscation but not jumping to malicious conclusions.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Score:**\n  - Obfuscated: 0.7\n  - Malware: 0.2\n  - Security Risk: 0.3\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Correctly highlights the suspicious appearance of random identifiers.\n  - Notes that the pattern could suggest obfuscation or concealment.\n  - The malware score of 0.2 might be slightly high given only static imports; however, if these identifiers are used maliciously elsewhere, this could be justified.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The malware score should be justified only if further context suggests malicious intent.\n  - Without evidence, a malware score of 0.2 might be slightly overstated.\n- **Recommendation:**\n  - Lower malware to 0.1 unless further evidence emerges.\n  - Keep obfuscated score high due to the naming pattern.\n  - Security risk remains low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Score:**\n  - Obfuscated: 0.6\n  - Malware: 0.1\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Correctly identifies the random identifiers and lack of context.\n  - Appropriately assigns low malware risk.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Scores are consistent with the reasoning.\n  - No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Score:**\n  - Obfuscated: 0.7\n  - Malware: 0.2\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Similar to previous, notes obfuscation but no active malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - The malware score could be lowered to 0.1 unless further context suggests otherwise.\n  - Obfuscation remains high, which is justified.\n- **Recommendation:**\n  - Slightly reduce malware score.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Score:**\n  - Obfuscated: 0.6\n  - Malware: 0\n  - Security Risk: 0.2\n- **Analysis:**\n  - Correctly states that these are import statements with obscure identifiers.\n  - No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:**\n  - Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of Findings:**\n\n- The **malware scores** across reports are generally conservative, with most at 0.2 or lower.\n- Given the code's static nature and lack of suspicious behavior, **malware scores should be closer to 0.1** or even 0, unless further context suggests malicious intent.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are justified, given the naming pattern.\n- The **security risk** remains low across all reports, which aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware score:** Reduce from 0.2 to **0.1** or **0** for all reports, unless additional code context indicates malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep high (around 0.6–0.7), as naming patterns are suspicious.\n- **Security risk:** Remain low, around 0.2, consistent with the static import pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Estimate:**\n\n**Malware:** 0.1  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.6  \n**Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect a cautious approach: obfuscation is notable but not necessarily malicious, and the static import pattern is benign unless further code reveals malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased solely on these snippets, the code appears obfuscated but not malicious. The scores should be adjusted slightly downward for malware, maintaining high obfuscation and low risk. Further investigation into the imported modules' content would be necessary for definitive conclusions.",
