  "purpose": "Asynchronous message consumer connecting to RabbitMQ, declaring queues and exchanges, processing JSON messages, and invoking an external handler.",
  "sources": "Reading connection parameters, queue declarations, message bodies, and external handler invocation.",
  "sinks": "External handler function call, message acknowledgment, and potential recursive retries on exceptions.",
  "flows": "Connect -> Declare queue/exchange -> Bind -> Consume messages -> Load JSON -> Call handler -> Handle exceptions with recursive restart.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, recursive retry pattern without backoff or limit, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard async RabbitMQ consumer with resilience retries. No hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity are present. Obfuscation and recursive retries are notable but not inherently malicious; they could conceal intent or cause operational issues. External handler is unknown, but no evidence suggests malicious behavior. The recursive pattern could lead to infinite retries if errors persist. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical message queue consumer with obfuscated identifiers and retry logic. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise is detected. The main concerns are obfuscation and error handling patterns, which should be monitored. Scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.3.",
