  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical message queue consumer with obfuscated identifiers and retry logic. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise is detected. The main concerns are obfuscation and error handling patterns, which should be monitored. Scores are consistent: malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.3."
