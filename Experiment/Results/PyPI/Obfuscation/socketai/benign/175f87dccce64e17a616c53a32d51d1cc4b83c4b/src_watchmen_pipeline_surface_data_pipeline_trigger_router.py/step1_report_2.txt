  "purpose": "Defines API endpoints for triggering pipeline processes synchronously and asynchronously with security checks and trace ID management.",
  "sources": "Reads data from incoming API request payloads (PipelineTriggerData) and environment/utility functions for generating IDs.",
  "sinks": "Calls to pipeline invocation functions, possibly executing pipeline logic based on the provided data; uses dynamic ID generation.",
  "flows": "Input data (PipelineTriggerData) -> ID determination -> invocation functions (try_to_invoke_pipelines, try_to_invoke_pipelines_async) -> response creation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamically generated IDs if traceId is blank; no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious domain connections, no obfuscated code; variable names are non-descriptive but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two FastAPI endpoints for triggering pipelines, both depending on a principal service for authorization. It generates or uses provided trace IDs, then calls pipeline invocation functions asynchronously. The code does not include any network connections, data exfiltration, or suspicious behaviors. The ID generation and invocation calls are standard. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors are evident. The variable naming appears obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent. The overall design seems to be for standard pipeline processing with proper ID management.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate API handlers for pipeline triggers with appropriate ID management. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present. It uses conventional patterns for asynchronous processing and dependency injection.",
