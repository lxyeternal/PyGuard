  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate serialization utility with flexible handler registration, lacking embedded malware. Its main security concern is potential misuse if untrusted handlers are registered, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. Obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. Overall, the security risk is moderate due to the dynamic nature of handler management, but no malicious activity is detected within the code itself."
