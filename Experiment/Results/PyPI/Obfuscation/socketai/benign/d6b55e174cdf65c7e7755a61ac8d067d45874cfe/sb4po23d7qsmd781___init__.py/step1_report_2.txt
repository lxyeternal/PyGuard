  "purpose": "No explicit purpose; appears to be a simple assignment statement.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Variable assignment; no flow of data from source to sink since there's only a static assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears random and nonsensical; the value assigned is a version string, which is common, but the variable name does not convey purpose. No other unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '1.3.1' to a variable with a seemingly random name. There are no input reads, no data leaks, no network connections, and no other code present. The structure is simple and straightforward. The variable name does not resemble a typical obfuscated pattern or a suspicious identifier. The assigned value looks like a version number, possibly for a package or dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign; it performs a simple assignment with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. The random variable name is likely non-malicious. Overall, there are no indicators of malware or security risks.",
