  "purpose": "Assign a version string to an obfuscated variable name with no malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Variable assignment of version string; no external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string to obfuscated variable name; no data flow to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no malicious code or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious logic are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hide variable naming rather than malicious intent. The value '1.3.1' is a benign version string. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores reflecting the superficial obfuscation but no malicious activity. Malware score remains at 0; obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6); security risk is minimal (~0.1). No evidence suggests malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static assignment with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent in this context.",
