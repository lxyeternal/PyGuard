  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and export error identifiers.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are used in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink as there are no data operations.",
  "anomalies": "Unusually named classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated-looking class names; no actual logic or data processing; only class definitions with pass statements.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two error classes inheriting from TypeError with obfuscated class names, possibly intended to obscure their purpose. The __all__ list exposes two string identifiers for error types. No external data sources, data processing, or potentially malicious operations are present. The code appears to be an intentionally minimal or placeholder module, possibly part of a larger obfuscated codebase, but on its own, it shows no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and does not perform any malicious actions. The obfuscated class names could suggest an attempt at concealment, but there is no malicious activity or security risk observed in this snippet.",
