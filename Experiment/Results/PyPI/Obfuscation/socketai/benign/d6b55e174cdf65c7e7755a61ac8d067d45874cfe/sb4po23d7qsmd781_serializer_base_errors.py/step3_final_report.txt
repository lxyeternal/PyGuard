{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes inheriting from TypeError with obfuscated class names, likely for error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with obfuscated names; no external input/output or data processing.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no external interactions or data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static class definitions without dynamic behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, minimal code structure, no logic or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two class definitions inheriting from TypeError, with obfuscated class names, and an __all__ list. No data input/output, network activity, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious behavior. Obfuscation score is high (~0.75), indicating class name obscurity. Risk score is low (~0.1), consistent with benign, minimal code. The scores are appropriate given the context and content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscated class names but no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The current scores accurately reflect its nature; no further action is necessary.",
