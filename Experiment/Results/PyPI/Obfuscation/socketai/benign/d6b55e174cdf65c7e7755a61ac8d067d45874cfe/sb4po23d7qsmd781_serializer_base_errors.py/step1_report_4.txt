  "purpose": "Define error classes and an __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow from sources to sinks exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names that inherit from built-in exceptions; no other suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an __all__ list for exports, which is standard. Two custom exception classes are defined with seemingly obfuscated or nonsensical names inheriting from TypeError. These class definitions are straightforward and do not perform any malicious actions. There are no inputs, data processing, or network interactions. The obfuscated class names may indicate an attempt to conceal purpose, but without further context, they are not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module defining custom error classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
