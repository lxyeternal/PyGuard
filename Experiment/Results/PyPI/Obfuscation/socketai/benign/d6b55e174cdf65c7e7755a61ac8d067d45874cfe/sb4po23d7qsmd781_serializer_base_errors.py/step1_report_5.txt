{
  "purpose": "Defines custom error classes and exports error names related to serialization/deserialization processes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; only static class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or to potential sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names (e.g., EIylRrqHqrBeUnupQVTAlebvCMGCMHJo), which may indicate an attempt to hide intent or confuse analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code declares an __all__ list to specify exported identifiers. It then defines two custom exception classes inheriting from TypeError, with non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated class names. The classes contain no additional logic or code. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows. The obfuscated class names could suggest malicious intent or an attempt to conceal functionality, but with no additional code or behavior, the purpose appears benign or deliberately obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated names and exports a list of error identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The obfuscation may be intentional to hide context, but on its own, the code is benign.",
