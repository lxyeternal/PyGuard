  "purpose": "Define error classes for serialization/deserialization and custom error types",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading sources",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data transmission points",
  "flows": "No data flows from source to sink",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking class names (e.g., EIylRrqHqrBeUnupQVTAlebvCMGCMHJo), no functional code beyond class definitions, no external dependencies or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom error classes inheriting from TypeError, with one class having an obfuscated name. The code appears to be straightforward, serving as error class definitions. There is no indication of malicious behavior such as data leakage, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors. The obfuscated class name may suggest an attempt at concealment, but on its own, it does not constitute malicious activity. The minimal code and lack of dynamic or external interactions indicate no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be simple class definitions for error handling with obfuscated class names. There are no signs of malware or security risks present.",
