  "purpose": "Define error classes for serialization and deserialization errors",
  "sources": "None (no data input or external data read)",
  "sinks": "None (no output, data leak, or untrusted data handling)",
  "flows": "No data flow present",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names, unusual class naming pattern, and minimal code with only class definitions",
  "analysis": "The code only defines two custom exception classes inheriting from TypeError, with intentionally obfuscated class names. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The obfuscation of class names could be a sign of attempt to conceal intent, but on its own, it is not malicious. The code appears to serve as part of a larger system to handle specific error types. No malicious actions, such as data exfiltration or malicious code, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated class definition with no malicious behavior. It appears to be a fragment from a larger codebase, possibly intended to obscure its purpose. There are no security threats or malware indications in this snippet.",
