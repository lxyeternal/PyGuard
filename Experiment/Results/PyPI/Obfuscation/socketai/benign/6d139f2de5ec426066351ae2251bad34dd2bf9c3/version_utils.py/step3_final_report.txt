{
  "purpose": "The code parses and formats Python interpreter version information, primarily for environment detection or version normalization.",
  "sources": "Reads sys.executable, interpreter version info, and regex matches on version strings.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; processes data internally without network or file system impact.",
  "flows": "Regex matching of version strings to extract components, then string formatting to produce normalized version info.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names; some variables used are undefined within the snippet, indicating incomplete or intentionally obscured code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs version string parsing and formatting using regex and string operations. Obfuscated variable names raise suspicion but do not indicate malicious intent. No external system calls, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. The undefined variables suggest incomplete code or obfuscation but do not imply malicious behavior. The assigned scores (malware=0, low security risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.7-0.8) are consistent with benign environment parsing functions that are obfuscated but not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving environment/version info parsing purposes. Obfuscation is suspicious but not indicative of malicious activity. The current scores are appropriate and justified based on the analysis.",
