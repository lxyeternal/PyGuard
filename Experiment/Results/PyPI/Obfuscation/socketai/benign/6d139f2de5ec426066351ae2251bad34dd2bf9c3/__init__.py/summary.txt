  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated but does not show active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the absence of malicious activity suggests a low security risk. Further investigation of the complete module, especially the definition of __version__, is recommended to confirm intent. Overall, the snippet appears benign but warrants cautious monitoring due to obfuscation."
