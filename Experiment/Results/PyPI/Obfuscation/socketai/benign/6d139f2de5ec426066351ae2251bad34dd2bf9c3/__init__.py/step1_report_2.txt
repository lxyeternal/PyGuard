{
  "purpose": "Import a specific attribute or function from a local module named 'version' and expose __version__ for external use.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement: from .version import rERrFhVtexQfkyVNsPZiAAHrJOgudzDI as wPAfFTXazCLwaqBZmkIHXJmTrhqqKIGV",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network, file, or environment operations; the code only performs an import and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing an entity (possibly a variable or function) with an obfuscated name from a local module, then exposing __version__ via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'rERrFhVtexQfkyVNsPZiAAHrJOgudzDI' is highly obfuscated, which may indicate concealment or attempt to hide malicious code. The alias 'wPAfFTXazCLwaqBZmkIHXJmTrhqqKIGV' is also obfuscated. The code does not show explicit malicious actions but uses obfuscation techniques common in malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs a single import statement from a relative module 'version' with obfuscated identifiers. There are no visible malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or file modifications. However, the obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide the actual content or intent. No suspicious external calls or dynamic execution are present. The code appears to be designed to conceal its true purpose, possibly to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and does not exhibit direct malicious actions. However, the obfuscated import indicates an attempt to hide or obscure functionality, which warrants caution. Without further context, it is unlikely to be malicious but could be suspicious due to obfuscation.",
