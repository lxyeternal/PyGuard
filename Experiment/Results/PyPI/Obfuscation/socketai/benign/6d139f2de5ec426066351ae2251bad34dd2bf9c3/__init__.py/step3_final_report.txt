  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated symbol from a local 'version' module and sets __all__ to expose '__version__'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing obfuscated symbol from '.version' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows indicating data exfiltration or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Import source to __all__ declaration; no further data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable name, no assignment to __version__, minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a nonsensical name, likely obfuscated, from a local module. The __all__ list exposes '__version__', but __version__ is not assigned here, suggesting it may be set elsewhere. No malicious actions, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious behavior on its own. The malware score is low (0), consistent with no active malicious code. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), justified by the nonsensical variable name. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), but obfuscation warrants caution and further review of the full module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated but does not show active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the absence of malicious activity suggests a low security risk. Further investigation of the complete module, especially the definition of __version__, is recommended to confirm intent. Overall, the snippet appears benign but warrants cautious monitoring due to obfuscation.",
