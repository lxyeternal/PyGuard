  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning strings and tuple values to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; no data leaks or external effects identified.",
  "flows": "Assignment of string and tuple values to variables; no flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious variable names are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward variable assignments with hardcoded string and tuple values. No external data input, no dynamic code execution, and no sensitive information handling are observed. The code appears to define version information in a typical manner without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple variable assignment with no malicious behavior, no suspicious activities, and no security risks detected.",
