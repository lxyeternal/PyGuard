  "purpose": "Assign version information to variables, likely for version tracking or configuration.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string '0.2.0' assigned to multiple variables, and a version tuple (0, 2, 0). No external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data flows, no data leaks, no external communications.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior. No dynamic execution or external dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments with obfuscated variable names. No external input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation, but this does not imply malicious intent. The code appears to serve as version info or placeholder data. All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, and the obfuscation is noted but not considered malicious. The security risk is minimal, given the static nature of the code. Confidence is high that there is no malicious activity, and the obfuscation is superficial.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as version or configuration data with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware or security risks. The reports' assessments are accurate, and no adjustments are necessary.",

  "obfuscated": 0.8,
