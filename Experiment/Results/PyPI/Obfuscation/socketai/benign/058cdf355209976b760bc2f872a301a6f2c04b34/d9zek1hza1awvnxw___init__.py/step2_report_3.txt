  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet, the context, and the scoring rationale.\n\n---\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n\n- All reports analyze the same minimal code: `from .terraform_validate import *`.\n- The code is a straightforward relative import statement, common in Python projects.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks are present.\n- The use of wildcard import (`*`) is a stylistic and maintainability concern but not inherently malicious.\n- No external data sources, network operations, or untrusted data handling are involved.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code does **not** contain any malicious activity, malware, or security risks.\n- The use of `import *` is discouraged but not dangerous in itself.\n- No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.\n\n### Errors or Flaws in the Reports:\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their analysis.\n- They correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- They appropriately assign low or zero scores for malware and security risk.\n- No significant logical flaws or reasoning errors are apparent.\n\n### Scoring Review:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate given the code.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All assign 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- **Security risk:** Mostly 0 or very low (0.1 or 0.2), reasonable given the context.\n- **Confidence levels:** Ranging from 0.8 to 1, reflecting high certainty about benignity.\n\n### Justification for Risk Scores:\n- Since the code is a simple import statement with no suspicious activity, high malware or risk scores are unjustified.\n- The only point of contention could be the use of `import *`, which is a style issue, not a security concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Scores should remain very low or zero** for malware and security risk.\n- **Obfuscated score** should stay at 0.\n- **Overall malware and risk scores** should be **0** or **very close to 0**.\n\n---\n\n### My Estimated Scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign. The scores are reasonable and aligned with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.\n\n**Final note:** This code snippet is a typical import statement with no malicious intent or security concern. The use of wildcard import is a style issue but does not impact security.\n\n---\n\n**End of review.**",
