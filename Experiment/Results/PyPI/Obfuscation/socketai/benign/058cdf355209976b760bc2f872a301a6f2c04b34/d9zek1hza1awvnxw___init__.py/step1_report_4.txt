{
  "purpose": "Import all components from the terraform_validate module, likely for validation or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the only source, bringing in code from terraform_validate.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present in this single-line import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data processing occurs here; it's a static import.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward; no anomalies or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement, which is a common practice to include functions or classes from another module. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity. As this is a single import, it does not include any embedded or obfuscated code, nor does it access untrusted data or perform network operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply includes the terraform_validate module, presumably for further use elsewhere.",
