  "review": "Let's systematically analyze each report and the corresponding code snippets.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports involve a simple import statement: `from .terraform_validate import *`.\n- There is no evidence of data processing, input/output, or network activity.\n- The code is minimal and appears to be part of a larger project.\n- Use of wildcard import (`*`) is a style concern but not inherently malicious.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior are present.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming if issues are present\n- **Issue presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import statement. No malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious activity are evident.\n- **Verdict:** **No security issues are present** in these snippets.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports\n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessment. They correctly note the stylistic concern of `import *` but also recognize that it does not imply malicious intent.\n- No logical flaws or mistakes are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### Score review and suggestions\n- **Confidence scores:** Mostly high (0.8–1.0), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- **Security risk scores:** Slight variation (0.1–0.2), reflecting minor stylistic issues but no real risk. These are reasonable.\n\n**Suggestion:** The security risk scores could be uniformly set to 0, given the absence of any security concern. The minor stylistic concern (wildcard import) does not warrant a risk score above 0.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5\n- None of these snippets show any malicious activity, data exfiltration, or code that could be exploited.\n- The highest confidence is 1, but the risk scores are low, which is appropriate.\n\n### Malware scores\n- Correctly set to 0, as there is no indication of malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging assumptions\n- No claims are made about vulnerabilities based on assumptions; the reports are cautious and accurate.\n- The only concern is stylistic (wildcard import), which is not a security issue.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- Minor variations in confidence and risk are acceptable but could be standardized.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment\n- **Malware score:** 0 for all reports, consistent with the evidence.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0, as no obfuscation is present.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0 or very close to 0, given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Overall conclusion\n- These snippets are benign import statements with no security risk.\n- The primary concern is style, not security.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0 (or very close to 0)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate; the code is safe. The only minor critique is the use of `import *`, which should be avoided for clarity but does not pose a security threat. The scores are appropriate, but I would recommend setting the `securityRisk` to 0 across all reports for clarity.",
