  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; the code only imports a module.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import statement alone does not create data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Very minimal code; no hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that brings in all functions, classes, or variables from a local module named terraform_validate. This alone does not indicate malicious intent, as it is a standard Python import. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no detectable malicious activity or security concerns based on the provided snippet.",
