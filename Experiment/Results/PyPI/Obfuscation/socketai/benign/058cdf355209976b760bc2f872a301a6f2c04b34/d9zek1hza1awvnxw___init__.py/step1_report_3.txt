  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from a module named 'terraform_validate' in the current package, likely for validation or testing purposes.",

  "sinks": "No sinks present in the code snippet",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows in the provided code snippet",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported content, but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies present",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement with a wildcard import from a local module. There are no input sources such as user input, network data, or environment variables. No data sinks or untrusted data handling are present. The wildcard import can be considered a code quality issue but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal, limiting the scope for malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of a wildcard import is a stylistic concern but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
