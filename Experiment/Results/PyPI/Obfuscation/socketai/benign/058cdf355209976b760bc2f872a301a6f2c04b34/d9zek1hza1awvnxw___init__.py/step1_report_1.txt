  "purpose": "Import all functions and classes from the terraform_validate module, likely for Terraform configuration validation.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the current package/module: from .terraform_validate import *",
  "sinks": "None directly in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be established from this single import statement alone; it simply imports symbols into the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The use of wildcard import (*) is generally discouraged as it can obscure which names are imported, but it is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward import statement from a relative module, which is common in Python projects. It does not contain any input reading, data processing, or untrusted data handling. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. Since only an import statement is provided, there is limited context, but nothing here suggests malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple relative import statement with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a standard part of Python package code structure.",
