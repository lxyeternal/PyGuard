{
  "purpose": "The code imports all functions and classes from the module 'terraform_validate'.",
  "sources": "The import statement indicates reading from the 'terraform_validate' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code does not include any execution flow beyond importing the module.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'import *' can be considered bad practice as it obscures what is being imported but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The snippet only contains an import statement, which is standard in Python for bringing in external modules or functions. No data input, external network communication, or sensitive data handling is visible. The module 'terraform_validate' may contain validation logic related to Terraform configurations, but that is not shown here. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The import style ('import *') may pose maintainability or clarity issues but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues based on the given fragment. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. Overall security risk is very low.",
