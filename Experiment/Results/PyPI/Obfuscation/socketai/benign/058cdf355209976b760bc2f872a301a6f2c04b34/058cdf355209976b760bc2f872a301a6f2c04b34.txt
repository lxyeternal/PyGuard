      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscation elements and an external URL that could be malicious, but no active malware or payloads are evident. The suspicious parameter and URL warrant further verification before trust or deployment. The malware score is low, but obfuscation and external dependencies increase risk. The overall assessment recommends cautious validation of the URL and purpose of the obfuscated parameter."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is a benign import statement with no malicious intent or security risk. The minor stylistic concern regarding 'import *' does not translate into a security issue. The scores and analysis in the reports are consistent and appropriate. No modifications are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing code for a Terraform validation library, with obfuscation likely for code protection. There is no evidence of malware, malicious payloads, or supply chain security issues. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not currently imply malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a complex, heavily obfuscated Terraform configuration validator. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of active malware or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score should remain at 0. The moderate risk score accounts for potential misuse if inputs are malicious. Overall, the code appears to be a validation tool with obfuscation that could be exploited but currently does not exhibit malicious activity."
