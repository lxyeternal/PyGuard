{
  "purpose": "The code consists of unit tests for a Terraform validation library, testing resource filtering, pattern matching, and property access with static data inputs.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded dictionaries, strings, and function arguments within the test functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions process data internally; no external data, network, or system commands are invoked, indicating no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input definitions through validation and property access functions, ending in assertions; no external or untrusted data sources are involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable, class, and function names (e.g., 'lbJIDssnDXexMSMfrPRBedOIhetNcfUZ', 'aBtULzMwuYLeHzZiNxcSGMVVSJsEhegm') are present, which could be suspicious but are common in obfuscated or proprietary code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of unit tests verifying resource filtering, pattern matching, and property access routines. No network activity, external data, or malicious payloads are detected. Obfuscation appears to be for code concealment or protection, not malicious intent. The functions perform validation tasks typical in configuration testing. The data flows are contained within the test scope, with no external or untrusted data sources. The consistent malware score of 0 and low security risk score of 0.2 reflect the absence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified given the naming but do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate testing code for a Terraform validation library, with obfuscation likely for code protection. There is no evidence of malware, malicious payloads, or supply chain security issues. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not currently imply malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe.",
