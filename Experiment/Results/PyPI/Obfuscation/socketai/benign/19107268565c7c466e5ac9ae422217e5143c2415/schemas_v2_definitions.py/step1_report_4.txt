  "purpose": "Define validation schemas for UUID strings and object key-value pairs",
  "sources": "Assignment of schema validation objects",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or external systems",
  "anomalies": "Code appears to be schema definitions with no dynamic or malicious behavior; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code structures",
  "analysis": "The code creates two variables representing validation schemas: one for UUID strings with a regex pattern, and one for generic objects with a validation message. There are no data input or output operations, network activity, or execution of external code. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malware indicators are present. The schemas seem straightforward for validation purposes, typical for configuration or form validation code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple schema definition for validation purposes, with no malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be legitimate configuration code without any signs of malicious behavior.",
