  "purpose": "Static validation schema definitions for UUID format and key-value objects.",
  "sources": "Assignment of static JSON schema objects; no data input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions; purely schema validation rules.",
  "flows": "No data flow; schemas are static and do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, which could be intentional obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static JSON schema definitions with obfuscated variable names. No dynamic behavior, data processing, or external calls are present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, with the only concern being the obfuscated variable names. Malware scores are consistently zero, and security risk scores are very low, reflecting the static and harmless nature of the code. The obfuscation score is higher (~0.7) in some reports due to variable naming, which is justified but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is benign, serving as configuration for validation, with no active malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of static JSON schema definitions with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity, data leaks, or security threats are evident. The obfuscation warrants a higher score but does not compromise security. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
