{
  "purpose": "The code functions as an integration test suite for a notification system, testing SMS, email, letter notifications, and template validation through API calls and assertions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables for configuration and secrets, file I/O for PDFs, function inputs for API calls.",
  "sinks": "External API calls via notification client, environment variables, file reads, assertions verifying content.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables and files flow into API functions; responses are validated through assertions; environment variables provide configuration and secrets.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables without explicit validation, assertions revealing internal content, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, performing standard notification API testing. No malicious logic, backdoors, or data exfiltration observed. Environment variables are used for secrets, which is typical in testing environments but should be secured. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are present. The code's structure and purpose align with legitimate testing activities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured test suite for notification workflows with no malicious intent or behavior. It relies on environment variables for configuration, which is standard but should be secured. No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious activity are detected.",
