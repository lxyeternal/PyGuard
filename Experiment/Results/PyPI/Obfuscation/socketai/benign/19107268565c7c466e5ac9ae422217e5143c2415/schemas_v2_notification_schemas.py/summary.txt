  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of notification schema definitions and payload construction functions. There is no malicious activity or payloads detected. The primary security consideration is input validation for URL parameters to prevent URL injection. The obfuscation of variable names is superficial and not malicious. Overall, the code is safe, with low risk, and should include input validation to mitigate URL injection risks."
