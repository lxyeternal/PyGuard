  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the reports' assessments.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code defines JSON schemas and functions for notification payloads, with URL construction via string formatting.\n- **Findings:** No malicious payloads or suspicious code behaviors. Potential URL injection if 'url_root' or 'notification.id' are untrusted, but no evidence of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3. The risk score is moderate, justified by the potential URL injection if inputs are malicious. No changes needed.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, schemas and functions for notification payloads, with URL formatting.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, just dynamic URL creation. No suspicious imports or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. This seems appropriate; the low risk reflects the potential for URL manipulation but no actual malicious activity.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Defines schemas and functions, with URL construction from parameters.\n- **Findings:** Same as above; potential for URL manipulation if inputs are malicious, but no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2. Reasonable.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar schema and payload functions, with URL string formatting.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; URL building from parameters is standard, with no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1. Slightly lower, consistent with minimal concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Schemas and functions, with obfuscated identifiers but standard URL formatting.\n- **Findings:** No malicious activity; identifiers are obfuscated but used consistently.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.2. The high obfuscation score is justified due to the naming, but it does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious payloads, network activity, or backdoors.\n- **Obfuscated:** Slightly higher in Report 5 due to the naming, but this alone isn't malicious.\n- **Risk Score:** Slight variation, but all are justified given the potential for URL injection if inputs are untrusted. The highest risk (0.3) in Report 1 seems appropriate, as URL injection could be exploited if 'url_root' or 'notification.id' are maliciously crafted.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The code itself appears benign, primarily schema definitions and payload formatting functions.\n- The main concern is the handling of untrusted input in URL construction, which could lead to URL injection or phishing if inputs are malicious.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation (beyond naming), or sabotage.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 (some obfuscation in identifiers, but not malicious)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (moderate, due to potential URL injection if inputs are untrusted)\n\n**Summary:** The code is standard for notification payload construction with schemas, and no malicious intent or malware is evident. The primary security concern is input validation for URL parameters, which is outside the scope of the provided code.",
