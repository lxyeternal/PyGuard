{
  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for various notification types and generate notification payloads",
  "sources": "Imports from 'integration_test.schemas.v2.definitions' and parameters in functions",
  "sinks": "String formatting of URLs, data serialization in functions, potential external URL construction",
  "flows": "Data from notification objects flows through functions into URL strings and JSON content",
  "anomalies": "Use of imported identifiers with seemingly random names; functions generate URLs based on input data; no hardcoded secrets or credentials",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of JSON schema definitions for notification payloads and functions that construct notification dictionaries with URL strings. No data is read from untrusted sources like environment variables or files. URL construction is based on input parameters, which are expected to be notification objects and URL roots. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The identifiers appear obfuscated but are used consistently for referencing IDs and URLs. No backdoors, hidden payloads, or malicious logic are detected. The code is structured, and functions generate formatted JSON responses for notification content, with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of schema definitions and payload construction functions for notifications. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent. The identifiers are obfuscated but used in a standard manner. No signs of malware or sabotage are detected. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for normal notification handling.",
