{
  "purpose": "Define JSON schema structures for various notification types (SMS, email, letter) and functions to generate notification payloads with URLs.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'integration_test.schemas.v2.definitions' for schema definitions; data access through function parameters such as 'notification', 'body', 'content', etc.",
  "sinks": "String formatting for URLs in 'uri' fields; usage of input data such as 'notification.id', 'notification.client_reference', 'body', 'content' that could be influenced by untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into functions, which generate dictionaries including URLs formatted with 'url_root' and notification IDs; no external data flows to other systems or network beyond URL generation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting to construct URLs could be exploited if 'url_root' or notification IDs are untrusted, potentially leading to URL injection. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors detected. No obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines JSON schemas for various notification types and contains functions that assemble payload dictionaries for notifications. The URL construction uses simple string formatting with parameters, which could be problematic if 'url_root' or 'notification.id' are untrusted, potentially enabling URL injection or phishing if these values are maliciously manipulated. However, there is no evidence of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, network connections, or backdoors. The imports are schema definitions, which are standard. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of payload formatting with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard schema and payload construction code for notifications, with no evident malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary concern is the potential URL injection if input parameters are untrusted, but this does not constitute malicious code per se. Overall, low risk of malware; moderate caution advised regarding URL parameters.",
