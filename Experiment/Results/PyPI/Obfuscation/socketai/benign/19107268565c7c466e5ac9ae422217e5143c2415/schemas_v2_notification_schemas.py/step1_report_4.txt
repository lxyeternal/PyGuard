  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for various notification types (SMS, email, letter) and functions to generate notification payloads with URLs.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'integration_test.schemas.v2.definitions'; usage of input parameters in functions (notification objects, body content, URLs).",
  "sinks": "Format strings for URLs, functions generating JSON payloads that include potentially untrusted notification data and URLs.",
  "flows": "Input data (notification objects, content, URLs) flow into functions, which then generate JSON payloads including URLs and IDs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting for URLs with potential unvalidated input, but URLs are constructed from parameters; no obvious hardcoded secrets or backdoors. No obfuscated code, no suspicious library usage.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of schema definitions and payload construction functions for notifications. It references imported schema definitions, likely standard or externally controlled. The functions assemble JSON objects with notification details and URLs incorporating 'notification.id' and 'url_root' parameters. No direct data leaks, system commands, or network activity is present. URL construction uses formatted strings with parameters, but no malicious URL patterns or embedded commands are detected. The code does not perform any data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden backdoors. It appears to be a straightforward implementation for generating notification payloads with URLs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily schema definitions and payload constructors for notifications. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The use of string formatting for URLs is standard; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code is present. Overall, it appears safe with low security concern.",
