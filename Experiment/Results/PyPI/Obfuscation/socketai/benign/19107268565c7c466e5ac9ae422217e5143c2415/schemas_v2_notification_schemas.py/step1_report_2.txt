  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for notification data structures and functions to generate notification payloads with URLs.",
  "sources": "Imported definitions from 'integration_test.schemas.v2.definitions'; input parameters to functions.",
  "sinks": "URL formatting in return statements of functions; usage of notification IDs and template IDs for URL construction.",
  "flows": "Function parameters (notification, body, from_number, url_root) flow into URL strings and payload dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "Use of formatted URL strings with dynamic notification IDs and template IDs; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code present; no obfuscation or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code imports schema definitions and uses them to construct validation schemas for notifications, including email, SMS, and letter types. It also defines functions to create notification payloads that include URLs built from input parameters and notification properties. The URL formatting uses provided 'url_root' and notification IDs to generate resource links. There are no signs of malicious code such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code appears to be standard schema definitions and payload generators for a notification service, with dynamic URL construction based on notification data. No suspicious imports, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema definition and payload construction for notification systems. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code segment. No malware indicators or suspicious anomalies are evident.",
