{
  "purpose": "Define JSON schema structures and functions for constructing notification-related payloads and responses for various communication channels (SMS, email, letter).",
  "sources": "Import statements at the beginning where external schema definitions are imported; function parameters where notification data, bodies, URLs, etc., are received.",
  "sinks": "String formatting for URLs, handling of notification IDs, and content data, which could potentially be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Input parameters such as notification objects and content flow into functions that generate URLs and JSON structures for API responses, potentially incorporating untrusted data into URL paths and content fields.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting to assemble URLs directly with notification IDs and URLs without apparent sanitization; the code relies on external data without explicit validation, which could be manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines schemas and helper functions to generate notification payloads. These functions assemble URLs and JSON objects dynamically, using input data such as notification IDs and URLs. While there is no evidence of direct data injection, the concatenation of unvalidated input into URLs and JSON structures could be a surface for URL manipulation or injection if malicious data is provided. The code does not perform validation or sanitization, nor does it execute external code or perform network activity directly. The imports are from schemas and definitions, likely static and controlled, reducing risk. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors is evident. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose within a notification system, with no signs of malware or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mainly schema definitions and utility functions for creating notification payloads. It does not contain malicious behavior or sabotage indicators. The dynamic URL construction should be noted but is not inherently malicious; potential risks could arise if inputs are maliciously crafted but are not explicitly handled here. Overall, this code appears safe, with no malicious intent detected.",
