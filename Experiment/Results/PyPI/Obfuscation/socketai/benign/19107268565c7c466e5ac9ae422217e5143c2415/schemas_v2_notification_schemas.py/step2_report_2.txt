  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Defines schemas and functions for notification payloads; URL construction via string formatting with parameters.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious payloads or backdoors; potential URL injection if 'url_root' or 'notification.id' are untrusted.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3.\n\n**Assessment:** The low risk score aligns with the analysis. No malware detected, and the code is straightforward schema and payload formatting. The potential URL injection is a moderate concern but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to report 1, schemas and functions for notifications; dynamic URL generation.\n- **Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior; potential URL manipulation if inputs are malicious.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the analysis. No malware or obfuscation. The risk is low, reflecting the potential for URL injection but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Defines schemas and functions for notifications; URL construction with notification IDs and URLs.\n- **Analysis:** Same pattern—dynamic URL building without validation; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malware, no obfuscation, low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Schemas and payload functions; URL formatting with parameters.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; URL building from parameters without validation.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent. No malware or obfuscation, very low risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Schemas and functions; URL construction with obfuscated identifiers.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscated identifiers but used consistently; no malicious behavior or code injection.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** The high obfuscation score (0.8) seems to be based solely on identifier naming, not malicious intent. No malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis. No evidence of malicious code, network activity, or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Mostly 0, except report 5 with 0.8, justified by obfuscated variable names, not malicious behavior.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.1 to 0.3, reflecting potential URL injection if inputs are untrusted but no active exploitation or malicious intent.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- The code is standard schema definitions and payload formatting functions for a notification system.\n- The only concern is the use of string formatting for URLs with untrusted inputs, which could lead to URL injection if inputs are maliciously crafted. However, there is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage.\n- The obfuscation is superficial (variable names), not malicious.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious payloads or behaviors)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 for report 5 (justified by variable naming), 0 elsewhere\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (moderate, due to potential URL injection if inputs are untrusted)\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall assessment is that these code snippets are benign, with standard schema and payload construction functions, and no malicious intent or malware present.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** I would assign a malware score of **0**, obfuscation score of **0.8** (for report 5), and a risk score of **0.2** across the board, consistent with the detailed analysis.",
