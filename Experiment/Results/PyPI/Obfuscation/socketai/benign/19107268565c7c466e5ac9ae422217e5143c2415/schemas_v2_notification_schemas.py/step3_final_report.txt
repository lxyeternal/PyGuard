{
  "purpose": "Defines schemas and functions for constructing notification payloads and URLs for various notification types (SMS, email, letter).",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'notification' objects, 'body', 'from_number', 'url_root', 'content', 'subject', 'email_from', 'notification.id', and other notification data.",
  "sinks": "URL strings constructed via string formatting, payload dictionaries returned by functions, and notification content objects.",
  "flows": "Input data (notification objects, parameters) flow into functions which generate URL strings and payload dictionaries for notifications.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string formatting for URL construction without input validation; obfuscated variable names in some identifiers; no sanitization or validation of 'url_root' or 'notification.id'.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of JSON schema definitions and functions that generate notification payloads with URLs constructed via string formatting. There are no signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation aimed at hiding malicious intent. The main security concern is potential URL injection if 'url_root' or 'notification.id' are untrusted inputs, which could lead to URL manipulation or phishing. The malware score is 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code or network activity. The obfuscation score is slightly elevated (around 0.8 in some identifiers) due to variable naming, but this does not imply malicious obfuscation. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), mainly due to the potential for URL injection if inputs are malicious, but no active malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of notification schema definitions and payload construction functions. There is no malicious activity or payloads detected. The primary security consideration is input validation for URL parameters to prevent URL injection. The obfuscation of variable names is superficial and not malicious. Overall, the code is safe, with low risk, and should include input validation to mitigate URL injection risks.",
