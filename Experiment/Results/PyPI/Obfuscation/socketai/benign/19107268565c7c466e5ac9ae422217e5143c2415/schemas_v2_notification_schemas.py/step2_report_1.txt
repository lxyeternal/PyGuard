  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** Defines schemas and functions for notification payloads; URL construction via string formatting with 'url_root' and notification IDs.\n- **Findings:** No malicious payloads, backdoors, or obfuscation. The main concern is potential URL injection if 'url_root' or 'notification.id' are untrusted.\n- **Malware score:** 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Security risk:** 0.3, moderate, due to potential URL injection if inputs are untrusted.\n- **Assessment:** The code appears straightforward, with no malicious intent. The risk is primarily from untrusted input leading to URL injection, not malware.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, schemas and functions for notification payloads; URL building from parameters.\n- **Findings:** No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. The code is standard for notification systems.\n- **Malware score:** 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, low.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior detected; potential URL injection risk exists but is not malicious.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Defines schemas and functions for notifications; URL construction from input parameters.\n- **Findings:** Use of unvalidated input in URL strings could be exploited if inputs are maliciously crafted.\n- **Malware score:** 0, no evidence of malware.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2, similar to previous.\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity; potential for URL manipulation if inputs are malicious but not malicious code.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar schema and payload functions; dynamic URL generation.\n- **Findings:** No signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Use of string formatting with parameters.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.1, very low.\n- **Assessment:** Straightforward, safe code; risk is from input validation, not malicious intent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Schema definitions and payload functions; identifiers appear obfuscated but used consistently.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior; no code injection or network activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0.\n- **Security risk:** 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Obfuscation is noted but does not imply maliciousness; code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code being schema definitions and payload functions without malicious payloads or network activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** Slightly higher in some reports (~0.8), likely due to the random-looking identifiers, but this does not indicate malicious obfuscation—just code obfuscation or naming obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variation, but generally low, reflecting the absence of malicious intent.\n\n### Critical points:\n- The main concern across reports is **URL injection** due to string formatting with untrusted inputs. This is a common issue but not malware.\n- No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads.\n- Obfuscation of identifiers does not imply malicious activity but could hinder readability.\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 (consistent with obfuscated identifiers but not malicious)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, mainly due to potential URL injection if inputs are malicious)\n\n**Overall,** the code appears to be standard schema and payload construction code for a notification system, with no malicious behavior. The main concern is input validation for URL parameters, which is a common security consideration but not indicative of malware.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.8\n- **Risk score:** 0.2\n\nThis assessment aligns with the reports' findings and the code's nature.",
