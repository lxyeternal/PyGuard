  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code sections reading environment variables, network functions, dynamic code execution points, hardcoded tokens, and input data.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file operations, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, and system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or hardcoded strings flow into network functions or eval/exec, potentially leading to data exfiltration or code execution.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic code execution, hardcoded tokens, missing or empty code, and suspicious data flows from environment variables to network/system functions.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, which are typical in malicious payloads. High obfuscation (0.8) and malware likelihood (0.75) in Report 1 are justified by these indicators. Reports 2 and 3 show less suspicion, with obfuscation scores of 0.8 and malware scores of 0.2, aligning with their descriptions. Reports 4 and 5 lack code content, leading to low risk and malware scores (0). The overall assessment indicates that Report 1 presents a high threat level, while others are benign or inconclusive. The scores are consistent with the described features and reasoning.",
  "conclusion": "The code in Report 1 demonstrates obfuscation and dynamic execution suggestive of malicious intent, warranting high malware and risk scores. Reports 2 through 5 show minimal or no suspicious activity, with scores appropriately reflecting their benign or inconclusive nature. Overall, the scoring aligns with the observed features, and further dynamic analysis is recommended for suspicious cases.",
