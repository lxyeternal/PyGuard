  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the provided code and the assessments.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports conclude that the code is purely schema definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- The imports are external modules that likely contain enums and schema components.\n- The schemas are static, used for data validation.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the issues in the code:\n- The code consists solely of JSON schema definitions referencing external modules.\n- No dynamic code, no data handling, no executable logic.\n- **No issues or vulnerabilities are evident in the code itself.**\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment; they correctly identify the code as static schema definitions.\n- They do not overstate or assume malicious intent.\n- They correctly note the absence of obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and security risks of 0 or very close to 0.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the static nature of the code.\n- No changes needed; the scoring aligns well with the analysis.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- The highest risk score is 0.1 (report 5), which is appropriate given the lack of any suspicious activity.\n- Since the code is purely schema definitions, a higher risk score would be unjustified.\n\n### Malware score:\n- Correctly assigned as 0 across all reports, as there's no evidence of malicious code.\n\n### Claims based on assumptions:\n- No report makes unwarranted assumptions; all are cautious and accurate.\n- They do not suggest vulnerabilities that are not supported by the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The code is safe, static schema definitions.\n- No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n- The reports are accurate and reasonable.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0 (or very close to zero, e.g., 0.0 or 0.1 if considering minimal risk due to external dependencies)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a standard, safe set of JSON schema definitions with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports are accurate, and the scoring is appropriate.",
