  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for template retrieval and preview endpoints, including parameters and response structures.",
  "sources": "Imported enums and schemas from external modules; schema property definitions; static JSON schema objects.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no untrusted data handling or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows; schemas are static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external enums and schemas, then defines multiple JSON schema objects for API request and response validation. The schemas specify data types, required fields, and properties without any dynamic or executable logic. No code execution, network activity, or data handling is evident. The code appears to be purely declarative schema definitions, typical for input validation in APIs, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of static JSON schema definitions imported from external modules. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears safe and standard for schema validation purposes.",
