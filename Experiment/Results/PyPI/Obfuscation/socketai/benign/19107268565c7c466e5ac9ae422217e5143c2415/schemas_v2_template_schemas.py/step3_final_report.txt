{
  "purpose": "The code defines JSON schema structures for templates, including parameters, responses, and previews, used for data validation in API interactions.",
  "sources": "External modules providing enums and schema components, used as references within the schema definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the schemas are static and used solely for validation purposes.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; schemas are declarative and do not process untrusted input dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; schemas are straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code consists exclusively of static JSON schema definitions referencing external modules. There is no dynamic code, network activity, or data processing involved. The schemas serve as data validation structures for API endpoints related to templates. All reports correctly identify the code as safe, static, and free of malicious behavior. The malware scores are appropriately zero, as no malicious intent is present. The obfuscated scores are zero, indicating clarity and straightforwardness. The security risk scores are also zero, reflecting the absence of vulnerabilities or suspicious patterns. Slightly elevated scores in some reports (e.g., 0.1) are unjustified given the static nature of the code; these should be adjusted to zero for consistency. Overall, the code is safe, and the assessments are accurate.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a set of static, well-structured JSON schema definitions used for data validation, with no malicious, obfuscated, or security-threatening elements. The reports correctly assess the code's safety, and the scoring is appropriate. Minor adjustments to risk scores can be made for consistency, but overall, the code poses no security concerns.",
