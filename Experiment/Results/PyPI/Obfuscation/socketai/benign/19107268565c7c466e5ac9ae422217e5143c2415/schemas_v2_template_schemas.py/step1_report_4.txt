  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for template parameters, responses, and previews used in an integration test module.",
  "sources": "Imports from integration_test.enums and integration_test.schemas.v2.definitions; JSON schema property definitions.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or data handling code present; schemas used for validation only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; schemas are static definitions for data validation.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs; schemas are standard and descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code imports schema components and defines multiple JSON schema objects for various API operations related to templates. All schemas specify data types, required fields, and formats. No dynamic code execution, data processing, network calls, or external data handling is present. The schemas are static data definitions intended for validation and contain no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely declarative schema definitions for data validation purposes. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious code, or security risks within this module. It appears to be a standard, safe use of JSON schema definitions for an API.",
