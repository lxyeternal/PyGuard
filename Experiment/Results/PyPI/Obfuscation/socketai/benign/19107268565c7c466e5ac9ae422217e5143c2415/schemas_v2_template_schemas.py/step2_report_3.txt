  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify that the code consists solely of JSON schema definitions, referencing external modules for enums and schemas.\n- No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code are detected.\n- The schemas are static, used for data validation, and do not process untrusted data directly.\n\n---\n\n### Report-by-report review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Correctly states the code defines JSON schemas for templates, with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe, legitimate schema definitions.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate scoring.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same as above; no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — reasonable.\n- **Conclusion:** No risks.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate scoring.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Again, static schema definitions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — justified.\n- **Conclusion:** Safe.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate scoring.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Consistent with previous; no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0 — suitable.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n- **Verdict:** **Appropriate scoring.**\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & analysis:** Same pattern; schemas are static, no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1 — slightly higher securityRisk score.\n- **Justification of securityRisk=0.1:** Given the code's static nature and lack of external interactions, this is probably overstated. It might be due to uncertainty or default scoring, but there's no real security risk here.\n- **Conclusion:** The scores are mostly appropriate, but the securityRisk could be lowered to 0, matching the other reports.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of scoring consistency:\n\n- All reports correctly assign malware=0 and obfuscated=0.\n- Security risk is consistently 0 across reports, except for report 5, which assigns 0.1 — likely overestimating.\n- Given the static, safe nature of the code, a securityRisk score of 0 is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all, as no malicious activity is detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** Should be 0, as there's no security concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis and the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. The only adjustment is to lower the securityRisk score in report 5 to 0, reflecting the absence of actual security concerns.\n\n**End of review.**",
