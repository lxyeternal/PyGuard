{
  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for templates, including parameters for retrieval, response structure, and preview functionality.",
  "sources": "Imported enums and schemas from external modules; JSON schema definitions embedded in the code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; schemas are static definitions.",
  "flows": "Schemas define data structures; no data flow from source to sink involving untrusted input or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Usage of external imports and static schema definitions appear legitimate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of JSON schema definitions for templates, including parameters, responses, and previews. The imports seem to bring in enums and schemas, which are used to structure data. The schemas specify properties, types, and required fields without any dynamic code execution, network activity, or security-sensitive operations. No signs of malicious code, obfuscated logic, or data leakage mechanisms are present. The code appears to be standard schema definitions with external references.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of JSON schema definitions for template data structures, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be safe and legitimate, primarily serving data validation purposes.",
