{
  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for template parameters, responses, and previews in an integration system.",
  "sources": "Imported modules: 'integration_test.enums' and 'integration_test.schemas.v2.definitions' for enum and schema definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling observed; schemas are purely data structure definitions.",
  "flows": "Schemas reference imported enums and definitions to validate data structures, with no data flow involving untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or malicious patterns detected. No use of dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or external network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of JSON schema definitions with references to external enum and schema definitions. These schemas define data formats and validation rules for a template system. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or network activity present. The imported modules may contain sensitive definitions, but their inclusion alone is not suspicious. The schemas do not process or handle untrusted data directly, and there are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or obfuscated constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard schema definition module intended for data validation within an API or application. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and serves its purpose of data structure validation.",
