{
  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for template parameters, responses, and previews in an API",
  "sources": "Imported modules: integration_test.enums and integration_test.schemas.v2.definitions; JSON schema objects within the code",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data flows leading to untrusted data handling or external operations",
  "flows": "Schemas define data structures; no data flow execution or processing logic present",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated constructs observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules and defines multiple JSON schema objects that describe expected data formats for API parameters and responses. These schemas specify property types, required fields, and descriptions, serving as validation models. There is no evidence of dynamic code execution, data manipulation, or external interactions. All imported modules appear to be schema definitions, and the code solely creates schema objects without any processing logic or side effects.",
  "conclusion": "The code strictly defines data validation schemas for API interactions without any malicious behavior or suspicious constructs. It functions as a static configuration setup. No malware or security risks are identified based on this code fragment.",
