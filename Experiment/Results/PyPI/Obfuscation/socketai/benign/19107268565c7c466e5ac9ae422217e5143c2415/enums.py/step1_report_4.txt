  "purpose": "Define and store a list of contact method identifiers (sms, email, letter)",
  "sources": "Assignment of string literals to variables",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "Variables assigned with string literals; list created with these variables",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names that appear as random strings, which could indicate an attempt to hide intent; no other anomalies",
  "analysis": "The code assigns string values representing contact methods to variables with obfuscated names, then creates a list containing these variables. No input from external sources, no data leaks, and no operations that process untrusted data. The variable names appear deliberately obscure, which may be suspicious but not malicious per se. There are no functions, network activity, or dynamic code execution present. The code's intent seems to be simple data storage or obfuscation of contact methods.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be straightforward data assignment with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
