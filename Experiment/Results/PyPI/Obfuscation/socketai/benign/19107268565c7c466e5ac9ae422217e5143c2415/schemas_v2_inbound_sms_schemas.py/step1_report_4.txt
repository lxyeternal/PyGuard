  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for inbound SMS responses and list of such responses in an API.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'klNYDzNIZkRUrqinqVkJRbYXROouDBji' from 'integration_test.schemas.v2.definitions'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, network operations, or sensitive data exposure observed.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or untrusted data processing; schemas are static definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'klNYDzNIZkRUrqinqVkJRbYXROouDBji', 'BOYoBVtupMCibnFSJGcUyiHdMpaaBlzS') are unusual and could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No other suspicious code behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of static JSON schema definitions used for API responses. The import statement uses an obfuscated module or variable name, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. The schemas specify data structures without any executable code, network calls, or credential handling. The presence of obfuscated identifiers raises some concern about possible concealment, but no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident. No dynamic execution or insecure data handling is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code mainly defines static JSON schemas with obfuscated identifiers. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment. The obfuscation of variable names warrants caution but does not necessarily imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be a benign schema definition with some unusual naming patterns.",
