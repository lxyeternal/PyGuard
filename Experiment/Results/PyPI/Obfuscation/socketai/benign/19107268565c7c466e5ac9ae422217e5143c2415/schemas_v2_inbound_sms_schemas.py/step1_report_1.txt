  "purpose": "Define JSON schema for inbound SMS response and list of inbound SMS messages",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'klNYDzNIZkRUrqinqVkJRbYXROouDBji'; schema properties referencing imported variables",
  "sinks": "None evident; schema definitions are static, do not process untrusted data",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; schema definitions are static and used for validation",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking variable names (e.g., 'klNYDzNIZkRUrqinqVkJRbYXROouDBji') that are imported but not revealed; no actual code execution or data handling is present",
  "analysis": "The code defines JSON schema objects with references to imported variables. The import appears to bring in a schema fragment. All schema properties are static, with no runtime data processing, input handling, or code execution. The variable names are obfuscated, which could be a red flag, but without malicious code or dynamic execution, this is likely just obfuscation or code minification. No hardcoded secrets, data leaks, or suspicious operations are present. The schema serves purely as data validation, not execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static schema definition for validating SMS data, with no signs of malicious intent or malware. Obfuscated variable names are suspicious but do not indicate malicious behavior on their own. No security risks are evident.",
