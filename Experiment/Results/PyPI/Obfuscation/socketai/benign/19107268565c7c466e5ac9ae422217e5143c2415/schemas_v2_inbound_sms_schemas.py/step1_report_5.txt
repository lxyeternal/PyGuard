  "purpose": "Define JSON schema for inbound SMS responses and list of messages for API validation.",
  "sources": "Import statement for schema definitions, JSON schema property definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data manipulation or system effects detected.",
  "flows": "Schema definitions do not include data flow from untrusted sources; primarily static schema structures.",
  "anomalies": "Use of variable references within schema properties could indicate dynamic schema generation, but no malicious intent is apparent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a schema component and constructs JSON schema definitions for inbound SMS data. The schemas specify data types, required fields, and references to definitions. There is no evidence of data injection, malicious code, or suspicious behavior. No network operations, environment variable access, or file operations are present. The code is purely declarative schema definitions with references.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard JSON schema definition for API data validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a data validation layer, not executing any harmful actions.",
