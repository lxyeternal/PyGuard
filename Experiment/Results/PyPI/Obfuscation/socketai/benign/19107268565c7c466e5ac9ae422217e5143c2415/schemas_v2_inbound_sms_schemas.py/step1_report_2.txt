{
  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for inbound SMS response data structure, including individual message details and list responses.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'integration_test.schemas.v2.definitions' and local schema definitions",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network interactions, or data sinks identified",
  "flows": "Schema definitions specify data structure but do not process or execute data; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., 'klNYDzNIZkRUrqinqVkJRbYXROouDBji') may suggest obfuscation or concealment, but are consistent within schema references; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code observed",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of JSON schema definitions with import statements and references. No dynamic execution, input processing, or external calls are present. Variable names appear intentionally obfuscated but are used consistently as references. There are no signs of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network communication. The structure is typical for schema definitions, with no suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward schema definition for SMS message data, with no malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscated variable names do not affect the functionality or indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears benign.",
