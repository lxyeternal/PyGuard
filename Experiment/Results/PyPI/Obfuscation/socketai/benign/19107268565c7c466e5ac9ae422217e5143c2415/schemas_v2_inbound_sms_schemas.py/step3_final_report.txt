  "purpose": "Static JSON schema definitions for inbound SMS API responses, referencing imported schema fragments.",
  "sources": "Imported schema fragment 'klNYDzNIZkRUrqinqVkJRbYXROouDBji' used within schema properties.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; schemas are declarative.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; schemas serve as validation structures only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name 'klNYDzNIZkRUrqinqVkJRbYXROouDBji'; no dynamic code or secrets present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static JSON schema definitions for API response validation, with references to an obfuscated imported variable. There is no dynamic data processing, network activity, or code execution. The obfuscated naming suggests minification or auto-generation, not malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the static nature and lack of malicious behavior. Malware scores are appropriately zero; risk scores are low, reflecting the static schemas. Obfuscation scores are high but justified due to variable naming. No evidence indicates malicious activity or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static schema definitions with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security threats are present. The current scoring and assessments are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
