  "sources": "The code may read input data from files, network sources, or user input, but none are explicitly visible in the provided content.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include file writes, network transmissions, or database operations if present, but no specific sinks are identifiable from the empty or missing code.",
  "flows": "There are no visible source-to-sink data flows due to lack of code; without actual logic, flow analysis cannot be performed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code features are present, given the absence of code content. The code appears to be missing or not provided.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is empty, with no functions, variables, or logic to analyze. Therefore, no security issues, malicious behavior, or obfuscation can be identified. It is likely that the code is incomplete or was not included.",
