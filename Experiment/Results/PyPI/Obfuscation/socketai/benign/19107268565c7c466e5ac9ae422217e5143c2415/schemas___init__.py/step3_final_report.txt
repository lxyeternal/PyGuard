{
  "purpose": "The code performs data processing, reading from environment variables, files, or network inputs, and outputs to console, files, or network.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, files, or network data; outputs include console, files, or network destinations.",
  "sinks": "Data flows from sources to sinks such as network connections, file writes, or console outputs, where untrusted data could lead to leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment, files, network) to output sinks (console, files, network), with no suspicious transformations or obfuscation detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as performing typical data processing tasks with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious network activity. The confidence in benignity is high (0.9). No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network connections are identified. The flow of data is straightforward, and no anomalies are present. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2) are consistent with a benign, low-risk script. Given the lack of malicious indicators, the overall assessment is that the code is safe, with a very low security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The scores and reasoning are consistent and appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
