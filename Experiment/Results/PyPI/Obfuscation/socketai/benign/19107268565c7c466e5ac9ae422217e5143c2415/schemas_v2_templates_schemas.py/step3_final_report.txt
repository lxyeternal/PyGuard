  "purpose": "Static JSON schema definitions for API request and response validation, referencing imported enums and schemas.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'integration_test.enums' and 'integration_test.schemas.v2.template_schemas'; static schema objects referencing these imports.",
  "sinks": "None; no data sinks, network calls, or dynamic data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static schema definitions with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and schema names; no dynamic code, user input handling, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static JSON schemas with obfuscated identifiers, serving validation purposes. No dynamic execution, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely due to code generation or intentional obscurity, but does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the static nature and obfuscation without detecting malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are high (~0.7-0.8); security risk scores are very low (~0.1-0.2). The code's purpose is benign, with no signs of supply chain compromise or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of static, obfuscated JSON schema definitions used for API validation. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate the security risk. Scores are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code.",
