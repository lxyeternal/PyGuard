  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for request parameters and GET response for templates in an API.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'integration_test.enums' and 'integration_test.schemas.v2.template_schemas', and the JSON schema definitions within the code.",
  "sinks": "No evident sink that executes untrusted data; schemas are static data structures.",
  "flows": "Imports provide data types, schemas define data structures; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamically imported enum and schema references with obfuscated variable names; no direct malicious behavior but unusual naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated enum and schema, then defines JSON schemas referencing these imports. The schemas specify structure for API request parameters and responses, with no execution or data manipulation beyond static schema definitions. No suspicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The naming conventions are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent. The schemas are standard for API validation, with no dynamic code execution, input handling, or other risky patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard schema definitions for API validation, with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The unusual variable names are likely obfuscation or code generation artifacts, not malicious indicators.",
