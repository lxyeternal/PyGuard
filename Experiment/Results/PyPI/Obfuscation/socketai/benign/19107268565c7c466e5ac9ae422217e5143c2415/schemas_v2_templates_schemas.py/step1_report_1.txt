  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for template parameters and response structures in an API.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'integration_test.enums' and 'integration_test.schemas.v2.template_schemas', and local variable definitions for schemas.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data sinks or external data handling shown.",
  "flows": "Imported data from enums and schemas used as references within schema definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable and class names, which might be an attempt to conceal purpose; however, no malicious behavior is directly evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific enums and schemas, then constructs JSON schema objects referencing these imported components. The schemas are standard JSON Schema definitions with no dynamic code execution, no user input handling, and no network operations. The obfuscated naming could indicate an attempt to hide functionality, but the content itself is straightforward schema definitions for API requests and responses.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard schema definition with obfuscated naming but no malicious behavior detected. No signs of malware, data leakage, or security risks are present. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not imply malicious intent based solely on this snippet.",
