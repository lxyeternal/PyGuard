  "sources": "Import statements for enums and schemas; usage of imported enum vPTDmCjIIJTfHQnXDENBqdcoUueNRVuO; references to imported schema BcZHWrAItfSnwqsyrRGKUAUOeQZmkMfn",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or eval functions",
  "flows": "The enum vPTDmCjIIJTfHQnXDENBqdcoUueNRVuO flows into the 'type' property in the request schema; imported schema used in response schema references",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical variable names; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors; schema definitions are standard",
  "analysis": "The code imports an enumeration and a schema, then defines two JSON schemas for API requests and responses. The 'type' property in the request schema is constrained by the imported enum, which could be a method to control accepted request types. The response schema references an imported schema for templates. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. All code appears to serve straightforward schema validation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard schema definition with imports, no malicious or suspicious behaviors detected. It primarily sets validation rules for API interactions without any signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
