{
  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for request parameters and GET response related to templates in an API.",
  "sources": "Import statements retrieving enum and schema definitions; use of these imports within schema definitions.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity; schema definitions are static and not executing or transmitting data.",
  "flows": "Schemas utilize imported enum and schema references to validate data structures; no runtime data flow or external data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-like variable names, which may suggest code obfuscation; no dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific enum and schema objects, then defines JSON schemas using static data, referencing these imports. The use of complex, non-descriptive variable names could be an attempt to obscure intent but does not imply malicious activity. The schemas are static JSON definitions with no apparent data processing, network activity, or executable code. No indicators of malware, backdoors, or malicious data handling are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward schema definitions with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code is likely part of a larger system to validate API requests/responses without any harmful intent.",
