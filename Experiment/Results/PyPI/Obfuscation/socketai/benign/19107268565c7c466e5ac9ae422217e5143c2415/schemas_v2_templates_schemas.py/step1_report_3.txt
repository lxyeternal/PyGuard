  "purpose": "Define JSON schemas for request parameters and response structure related to templates in an API.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'integration_test.enums' and 'integration_test.schemas.v2.template_schemas', and the dictionary definitions for schemas.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data; the code mainly defines static schemas.",
  "flows": "Imports provide data types, schemas are static definitions, no runtime data flow observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports enums and schema objects, then defines two JSON schema dictionaries with references to imported objects. The schemas are static and meant for validation, with no dynamic code execution or input handling. No external data processing or untrusted data flows are evident. The obfuscated variable names could be for code obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be standard schema definitions without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely schema definitions for API validation with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. No anomalies or malicious behavior detected.",
