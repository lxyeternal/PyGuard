{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a simple utility or functionality, but without explicit comments or context, its purpose remains ambiguous.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters and possibly environment variables or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file I/O, or subprocess executions if present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially reaching network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports are detected. The code structure is straightforward and does not exhibit typical malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain suspicious or malicious constructs. It does not involve hardcoded secrets, untrusted data handling, or malicious system calls. The overall structure suggests standard functionality without obfuscation or malware indicators. Due to the lack of specific context or external calls, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no evident malicious behaviors or security risks. The code seems benign with no suspicious anomalies or malware indicators.",
