{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be designed for standard functionality with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external modules, but no direct external input sources such as network or user input are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include logging functions, data serialization, and network communication modules; however, no malicious or suspicious data leakage points are clearly identified.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables and function inputs through processing functions to sinks such as logs or network modules, but no anomalous or dangerous flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are observed. The code is straightforward and uses common constructs without obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard Python functions, imports, and control structures. No signs of obfuscated code, malicious backdoors, or suspicious behaviors such as system manipulation or data exfiltration are present. The code’s structure is clear, and no unusual variables or dynamic execution patterns are detected. Usage of third-party libraries is standard and does not suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or credential leaks are visible. The code appears to be typical application logic without security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. The code seems benign and performs standard functions without suspicious actions.",
