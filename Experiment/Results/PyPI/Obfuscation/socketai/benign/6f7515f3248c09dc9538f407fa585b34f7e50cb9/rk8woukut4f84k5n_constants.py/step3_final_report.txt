{
  "purpose": "This code sets up environment variables and handles cryptography module import errors, primarily serving as configuration or initialization code.",
  "sources": "Import statements, variable definitions, and version info checks.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code does not process external input or output data.",
  "flows": "The code flow involves import attempts and static variable assignments; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and silent import error handling are unusual but not inherently malicious; no active malicious code or data leaks are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs minimal setup, with import handling and static configuration variables, some with obfuscated names. No network activity, data processing, or cryptographic operations are visible. The silent handling of import errors could hide issues but appears intended for robustness. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The overall structure indicates benign configuration code. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.6, risk: ~0.2) are consistent with this assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration/setup code with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. Obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not constitute malware. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
