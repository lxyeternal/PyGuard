  "conclusion": "The script is a sophisticated, obfuscated email utility with no direct signs of malware or malicious payloads. Its high obfuscation and dynamic features pose a risk of misuse if malicious inputs or dependencies are introduced. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to potential concealment and misconfiguration, but active malicious activity is not detected."
