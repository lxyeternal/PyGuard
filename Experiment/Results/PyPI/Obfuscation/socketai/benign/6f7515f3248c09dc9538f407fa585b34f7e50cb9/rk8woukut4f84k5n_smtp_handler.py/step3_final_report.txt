  "purpose": "SMTP connection manager with retries, pooling, and optional security features.",
  "sources": "Parameters provided during class instantiation (host, port, credentials, security settings). No external untrusted data sources are directly read.",
  "sinks": "SMTP connection objects, login functions, and email sending methods, which could be targets for misuse if credentials are compromised, but no evidence of such in the code.",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters -> SMTP connection setup -> login/authentication -> email transmission (not shown but implied). Error handling and retries occur around connection and login steps.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic attribute storage, references to undefined variables ('e' in exception handling), inconsistent exception handling, high obfuscation scores justified. No hardcoded secrets or malicious network calls detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages SMTP connections with retries, pooling, and optional security (starttls/tls). Obfuscation appears to be for code concealment rather than malicious intent. Exception handling is inconsistent, referencing undefined variables, indicating poor coding practices but not malicious behavior. No signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation and irregularities warrant caution but do not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SMTP utility with high obfuscation, likely to conceal complexity or deter reverse engineering. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is found. The malware score is set to 0.1 to reflect the obfuscation, but overall, the code appears benign. The security risk remains low.",
