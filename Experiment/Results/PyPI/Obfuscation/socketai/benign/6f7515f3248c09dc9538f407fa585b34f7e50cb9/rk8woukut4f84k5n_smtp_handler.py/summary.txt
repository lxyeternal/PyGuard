  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SMTP utility with high obfuscation, likely to conceal complexity or deter reverse engineering. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is found. The malware score is set to 0.1 to reflect the obfuscation, but overall, the code appears benign. The security risk remains low."
