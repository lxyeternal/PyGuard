  "purpose": "The code is intended to import specific classes or functions from local modules and define the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: '.envelope' and '.address'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or external effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import statements are static and do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The imported entities have obfuscated names (NPjTQgHtzYGdMcknVhhlxnHKbcpMWQqZ and qudPfbLLIUEkqOByNABHOEapeZhQayBb), which is unusual and may suggest concealment or malicious intent. The rest of the code appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two entities with heavily obfuscated names from local modules and defines an explicit public API. There is no evidence of data handling, external network activity, or malicious logic. The obfuscated import names could be suspicious, but without further context, they may simply be intentionally obscure. The code itself is minimal, straightforward, and does not include any malicious patterns or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in function, with the only anomaly being the use of obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not definitively indicate malicious intent based solely on this code.",
