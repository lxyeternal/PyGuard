  "purpose": "Module re-exports specific classes or functions from internal modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .envelope and .address",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; import statements are static",
  "anomalies": "Import statements import obfuscated identifiers, which could be suspicious but may also be benign; no other unusual activity",
  "analysis": "The code imports two specific entities with seemingly random or obfuscated names from sibling modules. It then declares __all__ with string literals for 'Envelope' and 'Address', which appear to be human-readable class names. The import statements themselves do not perform any malicious activity; they are standard Python imports. The use of obfuscated identifiers could be an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but as they are only imported and not executed or manipulated, the risk is minimal. There are no functions, data handling, or network activity present. Overall, the code is simple, with no immediate signs of malicious behavior, but the obfuscated import names warrant cautious review of the imported modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs standard import and export operations with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity is evident within this fragment, though the use of obfuscated names could be a minor concern. No security risks are apparent from this snippet.",
