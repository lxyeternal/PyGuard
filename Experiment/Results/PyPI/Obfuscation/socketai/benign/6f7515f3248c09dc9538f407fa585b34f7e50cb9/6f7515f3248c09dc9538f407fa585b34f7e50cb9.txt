      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated email handling library with cryptography and DNS probing features. While no direct malware is confirmed, its patterns of obfuscation, external DNS queries, and cryptography routines could be exploited for covert activities. The overall security risk is moderate, and further detailed analysis or sandbox testing is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is a utility class for managing file attachments, heavily obfuscated but without signs of malware or malicious activity. The main concern is obfuscation and potential misuse if inputs are malicious. Scores should reflect low malware risk (~0.1), high obfuscation (~0.7), and low to moderate security risk (~0.3). Further review of external utilities and input validation is recommended to ensure safety."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet appears benign but employs obfuscated identifiers that merit further inspection of the imported modules. No malicious activity is evident from this fragment, and the overall security risk remains low. The current scores are appropriate, with obfuscation being the primary concern."

      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated email processing and decryption utility with cryptographic handling and complex MIME parsing. While obfuscation and cryptography could be exploited maliciously, there is no explicit evidence of malware or malicious actions. The scores assigned are justified and align with the code's characteristics. Vigilance is advised, but the code appears to be a legitimate component with potential for misuse if misconfigured or malicious inputs are provided."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated email parsing utility with no evidence of malicious intent or activity. While obfuscation and environment variable manipulation are suspicious, they do not constitute malicious behavior in this context. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware at 0, obfuscation high (~0.8), and low security risk (~0.2). Monitoring is recommended if deployed in production, especially regarding environment variable usage."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions for MIME detection and data normalization. While obfuscation and unusual error handling are present, there is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The security risk is low, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming, and the overall risk score remains low. Continuous review is recommended to clarify obfuscated parts and ensure proper error handling."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SMTP utility with high obfuscation, likely to conceal complexity or deter reverse engineering. No evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage is found. The malware score is set to 0.1 to reflect the obfuscation, but overall, the code appears benign. The security risk remains low."

Its high obfuscation and dynamic features pose a risk of misuse if malicious inputs or dependencies are introduced. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to potential concealment and misconfiguration, but active malicious activity is not detected."
