  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions for MIME detection and data normalization. While obfuscation and unusual error handling are present, there is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The security risk is low, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming, and the overall risk score remains low. Continuous review is recommended to clarify obfuscated parts and ensure proper error handling."
