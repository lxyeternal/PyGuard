{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform file type detection, content reading, and data handling, possibly for processing files or data streams.",
  "sources": "Data is read from bytes input, file paths, and stream objects such as TextIOBase and BufferedIOBase.",
  "sinks": "The data is returned or processed further; no explicit data sinks such as network transmission or storage are visible.",
  "flows": "Input data (bytes, streams, paths) flows into functions which process or convert it, then results are returned; no external sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic type checks and conversions, no hardcoded credentials, no suspicious domain or network activity. The code seems straightforward, with some convoluted logic but nothing inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The functions handle file and stream data, perform type checks, and convert or detect file types using the 'magic' library. The code does not contain network access, credential handling, or data exfiltration. No obfuscated code patterns or malware-like behaviors are apparent. The logic is focused on data detection and normalization, which is common in processing libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, mainly for file and data type detection and handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data leaks. No suspicious external network activity or obfuscated code is present.",
