  "conclusion": "The code is a utility class for managing file attachments, heavily obfuscated but without signs of malware or malicious activity. The main concern is obfuscation and potential misuse if inputs are malicious. Scores should reflect low malware risk (~0.1), high obfuscation (~0.7), and low to moderate security risk (~0.3). Further review of external utilities and input validation is recommended to ensure safety."
