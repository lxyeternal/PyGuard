  "purpose": "Check if a list of domains are active or reachable",
  "sources": "Input list of domain strings",
  "sinks": "Potential network requests to verify domain status, outputting reachable domains",
  "flows": "Input domain list -> perform network checks on each domain -> output list of reachable domains",
  "anomalies": "Lack of implementation details; no actual code provided to perform checks, potential placeholder code",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is mainly a comment and a function signature without implementation. It claims to check domain activity status but contains no actual logic, network requests, or data handling. There are no signs of hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code. The only potential concern is that, if implemented improperly, network checks could be exploited, but none are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a placeholder or incomplete snippet, with no active logic or malicious behavior. It merely describes the intended functionality. Therefore, it poses no security risk in its current form.",
