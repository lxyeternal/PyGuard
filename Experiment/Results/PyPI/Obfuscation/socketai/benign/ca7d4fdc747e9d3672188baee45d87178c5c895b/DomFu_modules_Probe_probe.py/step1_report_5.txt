  "purpose": "A domain checker that verifies if domains are working or not.",
  "sources": "Input list of domain strings provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "Potential network request functions (not explicitly shown but implied for checking domain status).",
  "flows": "Input domains are checked for availability, with results filtered accordingly.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet provided is incomplete; there are no actual implementations of network requests or checks. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal description of a domain prober tool. It mentions input domains and output domains, with a brief comment on its purpose. There are no functions, no network calls, or other logic shown. No obfuscated or malicious code structures are evident. Without actual implementation details, it's impossible to determine any malicious behavior or security issues from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment is a high-level description without executable content. No malicious behavior or security risks can be inferred from the snippet as it lacks functional code. The purpose appears benign and straightforward.",
