  "purpose": "Placeholder or documentation for a domain checker script; no executable logic present.",
  "sources": "Comments and function signature; no data input sources are active.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows due to lack of implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of actual code, only descriptive comments and signatures.",
  "analysis": "The code is a non-functional placeholder with no logic, network requests, or domain checking implementation. All reports correctly identify the lack of executable code and malicious activity. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately zero, with confidence levels reflecting the limited information. No suspicious patterns or behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are purely placeholders or documentation, posing no security threat. The assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's state.",
