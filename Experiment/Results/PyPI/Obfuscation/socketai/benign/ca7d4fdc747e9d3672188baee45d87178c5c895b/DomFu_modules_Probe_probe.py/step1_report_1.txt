  "analysis": "The provided code contains only a comment describing a domain probe, a list type annotation, and a comment explaining input/output. There is no executable logic, no imports, and no network activity or domain checking functions. The absence of implementation means no malicious behavior can be inferred. The code is incomplete and appears to be a placeholder or documentation rather than actual functional code.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any executable logic, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is simply a descriptive comment with no active code. Therefore, there are no malware concerns or security threats.",
