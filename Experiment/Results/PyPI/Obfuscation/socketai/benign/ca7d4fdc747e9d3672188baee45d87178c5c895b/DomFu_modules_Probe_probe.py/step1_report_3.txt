  "flows": "Input list -> Network requests to each domain -> Filtered output list of working domains.",
  "anomalies": "No code implementation provided; only description and comments are visible; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a simple domain checker based on description, with no actual implementation shown. It likely performs network requests to verify domains. No malicious or suspicious code, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident from the provided snippet. Absence of implementation details prevents identifying malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the code functions as a domain availability checker without any indication of malicious intent or security risks. The provided snippet is mostly documentation with no executable code. Confidence in this conclusion is high given the lack of suspicious features.",
