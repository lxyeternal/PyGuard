  "purpose": "A domain probing tool to check if specific domains are operational.",
  "sources": "Input list of domain names provided by the user.",
  "sinks": "Output list of active domains; no external data sinks or network connections are explicitly shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Input list -> Domain check process -> Filtered output list of working domains.",
  "anomalies": "No code implementation provided; only descriptive comments and license info. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors visible.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet only contains a descriptive comment about the function purpose, input/output format, and license information. There is no executable code, no network operations, or data handling routines shown. Without actual code implementation, it is impossible to determine malicious intent or security risks. The description suggests a simple domain checking utility, which is common and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a benign domain probing script description. No suspicious or malicious activity can be inferred from the available content.",
