{
  "purpose": "The code snippet is a comment/descriptive outline of a function fetchCertSpot(\"tropyl.com\") that queries CertSpotter for subdomains.",
  "sources": "No actual code present; only comments describing input and output.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or data leaks; no executable code.",
  "flows": "None, as there is no implementation; only descriptive comments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a suspicious string 'MQoLndpjKiuPgoAfwUAcbuZwVnrJGPnv' mentioned in comments, but no actual code or behavior associated.",
  "analysis": "The snippet contains only comments and no executable logic. The mention of a cryptic string suggests potential obfuscation or placeholder data, but without code, it cannot be malicious. All reports correctly identify the absence of active code and assign low security and malware scores. The suspicious string alone does not justify higher scores without concrete malicious activity. The overall assessment indicates minimal risk, with scores appropriately low.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only descriptive, with no evidence of malicious or obfuscated behavior. The suspicious string is noted but not actionable. The scores across reports are consistent and justified given the limited information.",
