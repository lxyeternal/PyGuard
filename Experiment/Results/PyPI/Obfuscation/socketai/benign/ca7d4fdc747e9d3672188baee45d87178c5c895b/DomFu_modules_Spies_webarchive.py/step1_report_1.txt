The code comments mention a specific string for querying, but do not show any input validation or security checks.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The provided code snippet is minimal and lacks implementation details, making it difficult to fully assess. The function fetchWebArchive could perform network requests to external services, which may pose privacy or security risks if misused. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials or malicious code, but the absence of implementation details prevents definitive conclusions. The comments and structure suggest a benign utility, but the actual behavior depends on fetchWebArchive's implementation. Overall, the code itself appears harmless, but its reliance on external functions and data could be exploited if not properly secured.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code appears to be a simple utility for querying web archives and returning domain data. There are no explicit malicious behaviors observed in this snippet. However, due to missing implementation details of fetchWebArchive, potential risks depend on its underlying code. Overall, the code looks benign but warrants further review of fetchWebArchive's implementation for full security assessment.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.6,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
