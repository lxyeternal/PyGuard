  "purpose": "Import statements for modules related to threat intelligence gathering and probing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing modules that fetch data from various external threat intelligence sources (Crt.sh, AlienVault, CertSpot, Shodan, Chaos, VirusTotal, WebArchive, Subdomain) and a probing module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present in this snippet; only module imports.",
  "flows": "No data flow observed within this code snippet; it only imports modules, no data processing or flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors such as dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets. The code consists solely of import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several modules intended for threat intelligence and probing activities, likely to be used in security assessments or monitoring tools. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior. The imported modules themselves could potentially contain malicious code, but based solely on these import statements, there is no indication of malicious intent. The code is straightforward and appears to be part of a larger project.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard set of import statements for modules involved in security data collection and probing. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment itself. It appears to be a benign part of a larger security or reconnaissance tool.",
