  "purpose": "Import statements for modules related to threat intelligence, reconnaissance, and security data gathering.",
  "sources": "Modules such as fetchCrtSh, fetchAlienv, fetchCertSpot, fetchShodan, fetchChaos, fetchVirusTotal, fetchWebArchive, fetchAll, and Probe.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only imports modules, no data flow or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no executable code or data flow, only imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statements with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing functions from modules associated with security intelligence gathering. No executable logic, network calls, or data processing is visible. The modules' names suggest legitimate threat intelligence functions. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1-0.2) are appropriate given the benign appearance of the code. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets are present. The cautious stance in the reports aligns with best practices, recognizing that the modules could be misused if malicious, but the code snippet itself is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements from modules related to security intelligence gathering. The scores and reasoning in the reports are accurate and appropriate. No further action is necessary unless additional context reveals malicious behavior within the imported modules.",
