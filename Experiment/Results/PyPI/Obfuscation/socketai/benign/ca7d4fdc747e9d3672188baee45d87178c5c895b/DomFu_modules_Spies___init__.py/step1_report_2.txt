  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows are observed due to lack of specific code logic or data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet appears empty or non-functional, with no logic, data handling, or imports; no unusual features or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is essentially empty or non-existent, containing no functions, logic, data handling, or external interactions. Without actual code, no malicious behavior, security issues, or anomalies can be identified. The absence of code makes it impossible to analyze further.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet does not contain any executable logic, data handling, or interactions that could be malicious or insecure. It appears to be empty or incomplete, so no risks are evident.",
