  "conclusion": "All reports accurately acknowledge the lack of code and assign low or zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The assessments are appropriate given the incomplete or missing code snippets. No malicious activity or obfuscation can be inferred, and the risk remains minimal. The current scoring and conclusions are justified and do not require adjustments."
