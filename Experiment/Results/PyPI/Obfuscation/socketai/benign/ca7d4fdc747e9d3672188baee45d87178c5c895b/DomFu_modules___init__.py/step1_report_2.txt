{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or manipulation, but without specific context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from the 'input_data' variable, external files, or user input via functions like 'input()' (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls (e.g., 'requests' library), file operations (open/write), or environment variables, if used unsafely.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, files, variables) to sinks (network, files), possibly passing through transformation functions.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious system calls are detected. No unusual language features or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined for typical security issues, including hardcoded secrets, malicious payloads, or backdoors. No such behaviors are evident. Usage of third-party libraries, if present, appears standard. No obfuscation or suspicious logic was detected. The structure suggests legitimate functionality, with no signs of malicious intent. Potential data flow from input sources to output sinks was noted but appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be a normal, possibly data processing, script with no immediate security concerns.",
