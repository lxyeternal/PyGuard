{
  "purpose": "A webhook handler for GitHub events that verifies signatures, parses payloads, and executes registered hooks.",
  "sources": "request headers (X-Hub-Signature, X-Github-Event, Content-Type, X-Github-Delivery), request payload (JSON or form data).",
  "sinks": "Signature verification via HMAC, payload processing, hook invocation.",
  "flows": "Request headers and payload are read; signature is verified; payload is parsed; hooks are called with payload data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, reliance on external secrets, no explicit payload validation beyond signature check.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard webhook handler implementing signature verification, payload parsing, and callback invocation. Obfuscation is present but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or network activity suggest malicious behavior. Signature verification uses HMAC with SHA1, which is standard for GitHub webhooks. The code structure and logic are consistent with legitimate webhook processing. No evidence of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious network activity is found.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, obfuscated webhook handler with no signs of malware or supply chain sabotage. Obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. Overall risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score around 0.75, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.3).",
