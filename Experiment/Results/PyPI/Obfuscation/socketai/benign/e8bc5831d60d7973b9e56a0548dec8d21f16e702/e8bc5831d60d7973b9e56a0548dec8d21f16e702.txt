The current scores are appropriate given the evidence, with high suspicion due to obfuscation but low likelihood of malicious activity. Additional context or runtime analysis is necessary to confirm or refute malicious intent."

Obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. Overall risk is low, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score around 0.75, and a moderate security risk score (~0.2-0.3)."
