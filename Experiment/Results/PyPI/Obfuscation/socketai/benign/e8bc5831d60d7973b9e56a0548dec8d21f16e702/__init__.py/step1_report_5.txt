  "purpose": "Import a specific object or function from the 'github_webhook.webhook' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement is the source of code execution; it reads the module and specific attribute.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink could be the use of 'ojvUZlmvxKDkmHLEJYRqKfZxMqrVgXmD' if executed or manipulated elsewhere, but not directly in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The flow would depend on how 'ojvUZlmvxKDkmHLEJYRqKfZxMqrVgXmD' is used downstream, which is not provided here.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual aspects include the import of an object with a seemingly random or obfuscated name, which may suggest code obfuscation or hiding intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a single import statement importing a specific object with a complex, possibly obfuscated name from a module. No other code is present, so the behavior cannot be assessed beyond this import statement. The import could be legitimate, but the obscure name raises suspicion of potential obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no apparent hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or dangerous functions within this snippet. Without additional context, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior but has signs of possible obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an obfuscated name, which could be benign or part of obfuscated code. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior based solely on this snippet, but the obscure naming warrants cautious review of subsequent code that uses this import.",
