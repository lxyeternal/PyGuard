  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify the import of an object named `ojvUZlmvxKDkmHLEJYRqKfZxMqrVgXmD` from `github_webhook.webhook`.\n- The object name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious.\n- No additional code, data flows, or sinks are provided, limiting definitive conclusions.\n- The malware scores are low (0.2–0.3), and the obfuscated scores are high (0.7–0.8).\n- The confidence levels are moderate (0.4–0.6).\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Issues:\n- **Presence in code:** All reports correctly identify the import statement. The code snippet is minimal, and the import is present in all.\n- **Malicious behavior:** No direct malicious activity (network, file, data exfiltration) is observable. The object is imported but not used here.\n- **Obfuscation suspicion:** The object name is obfuscated, which is suspicious and warrants caution.\n\n### Logical flaws or reasoning issues:\n- The reports assume obfuscation might indicate malicious intent, which is a valid concern but not definitive.\n- The scores for malware (0.2–0.3) seem reasonable given the evidence; however, the high obfuscation scores (0.7–0.8) are justified.\n- The reports do not overstate the risk; they recommend further review, which is appropriate.\n\n### Score review:\n- The **malware scores** are low, reflecting that no malicious activity is directly observed. This is reasonable.\n- The **obfuscated scores** are high, aligning with the suspicious naming.\n- The **security risk scores** are moderate, which is acceptable given the context.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **risk scores** should remain low to moderate unless further code reveals malicious behavior.\n- The **malware score** should stay around 0.2–0.3 unless additional evidence suggests otherwise.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay high, as the naming is suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0.2–0.3 (no direct evidence)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7–0.8 (suspicious naming)\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (moderate, due to obfuscation)\n\n---\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- If subsequent code uses this imported object in a malicious way, scores should be adjusted upward.\n- The package `github_webhook` appears legitimate, but the obfuscated object raises suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nBased on the provided snippets and analysis, **the current scores are reasonable**. No significant adjustments are necessary unless further code reveals malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:**\n- Keep malware score at ~0.2–0.3.\n- Maintain obfuscated score at ~0.7–0.8.\n- Keep overall security risk moderate (~0.3).\n\nFurther code review is recommended to confirm the actual behavior of the imported object.\n\n**Note:** The import alone does not confirm malicious intent but warrants cautious review due to obfuscation.",
