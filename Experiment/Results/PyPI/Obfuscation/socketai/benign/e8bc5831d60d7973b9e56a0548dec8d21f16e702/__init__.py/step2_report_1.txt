  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the issues, and assess the scoring.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports concern the same import statement: `from github_webhook.webhook import ojvUZlmvxKDkmHLEJYRqKfZxMqrVgXmD`.\n- The key concern is the obfuscated, nonsensical name `ojvUZlmvxKDkmHLEJYRqKfZxMqrVgXmD`.\n- No additional code, functions, or behaviors are provided, so direct malicious activity cannot be confirmed.\n- The module `github_webhook` appears legitimate, but the imported object name is suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Issue presence:** The import statement is present in all reports, and the object name is obfuscated. No other code or behaviors are shown, so the core concern is obfuscation rather than active malicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws in the report's logic:** The reports are consistent; they correctly identify the obfuscated name as suspicious but do not claim direct malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** The malware scores are low (0.2-0.3), which aligns with the lack of evidence for active malicious behavior. The obfuscated scores are high (~0.7-0.8), which is appropriate given the suspicious naming.\n\n---\n\n### Critical analysis of scores and reasoning:\n\n1. **Obfuscated score (~0.7-0.8):**  \n   Justified, as the name is clearly obfuscated, which is unusual and warrants caution.\n\n2. **Malware score (~0.2-0.3):**  \n   Slightly higher than zero but still low, reflecting suspicion but no direct evidence. This seems reasonable.\n\n3. **Security risk (~0.3-0.4):**  \n   Slightly elevated, considering the obfuscation could hide malicious intent. Given no further context, this is acceptable.\n\n4. **Confidence levels (~0.4-0.6):**  \n   Moderate confidence, appropriate for minimal info but suspicion due to obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The import alone, without further context, does not demonstrate malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated name is a red flag, but without evidence of code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity, the risk remains low.\n- The scores could be slightly adjusted downward for malware and security risk if we assume the obfuscation alone isn't enough for higher concern.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should stay around 0.2-0.3, as there's no direct malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Justified at ~0.7-0.8.\n- **Risk score:** Given the suspicion but no evidence, around 0.3-0.4 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n- The import statement's obfuscated object name is suspicious but not confirmed malicious.\n- No code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is shown.\n- The scores are consistent with the evidence.\n\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0.2  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.75  \n- **Risk:** 0.35\n\nFurther code review or runtime analysis would be needed to confirm any malicious activity.",
