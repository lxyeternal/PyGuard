  "purpose": "Import a specific object from the 'github_webhook.webhook' module, likely for handling webhook events.",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a third-party package 'github_webhook'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks identified; no processing or output functions shown.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not explicitly present; the import may lead to further code execution if used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object 'ojvUZlmvxKDkmHLEJYRqKfZxMqrVgXmD' appears to be a non-descriptive, possibly obfuscated identifier, which could be suspicious. No additional code provided to determine if it is malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a third-party package. The imported object has a seemingly random or obfuscated name, which might indicate malicious intent or obfuscation. Without further code or context, it is not possible to assess malicious behavior directly. The import alone does not perform any harmful action but could be used to invoke malicious code if the object or package is malicious. No other suspicious behaviors, such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors, are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone is minimal and does not show explicit malicious behavior. However, the obfuscated import name warrants caution, especially if the package or object is not well-known or trusted. Additional context or code is needed to confirm safety.",
