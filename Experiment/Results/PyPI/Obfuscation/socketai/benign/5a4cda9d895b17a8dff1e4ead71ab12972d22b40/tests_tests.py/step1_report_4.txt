{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python module, possibly designed for data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from standard input, function parameters, or external libraries; no explicit input sources are shown in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "Data might be sent to output functions, external servers, or stored in files; no explicit sinks such as network connections or file writes are evident.",
  "flows": "No apparent untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the code executes internal logic without external data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution, are present.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review of the code reveals standard syntax and structure. There are no signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. Usage of third-party libraries appears normal, and there are no unusual operations. The code does not include network connections, data exfiltration mechanisms, or code injection points. Overall, the code appears benign based on the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a typical, benign Python module with no malicious intent identified.",
