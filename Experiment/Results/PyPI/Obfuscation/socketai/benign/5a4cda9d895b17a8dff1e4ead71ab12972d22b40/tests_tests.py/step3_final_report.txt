    "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
    "sources": "No code provided; assessments based on descriptions and summaries.",
    "sinks": "Not applicable; no untrusted data sources identified due to lack of code.",
    "flows": "Not applicable; no code to analyze for data flow.",
    "anomalies": "Absence of code limits detection; some reports claim thorough review without code, leading to inconsistent confidence levels.",
    "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code and refrain from overestimating risk. However, reports claiming thorough review without code should lower their confidence scores to reflect the lack of actual analysis. Malware scores are appropriately zero across all reports. Security risk scores are low (~0.1-0.2), indicating minimal concern. Confidence scores in some reports (notably 2 and 4) are overstated given the absence of code; adjusting these downward improves consistency. Obfuscation scores are zero, matching the lack of evidence. Overall, the assessments are reasonable but should calibrate confidence levels to match the evidence.",
    "conclusion": "Given no code was provided for review, the likelihood of malicious activity is effectively zero. The current high confidence scores in some reports are unjustified; adjusting confidence downward aligns better with the evidence. Malware and obfuscation scores remain at zero, and security risk scores should stay low (~0.1-0.2). The overall assessment indicates minimal threat, consistent with the lack of code and benign descriptions.",
