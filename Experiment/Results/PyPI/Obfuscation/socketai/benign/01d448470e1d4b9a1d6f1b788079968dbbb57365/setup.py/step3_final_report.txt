  "purpose": "Standard setup configuration for a Python package, defining metadata, dependencies, entry points, and package data.",
  "sources": "Static variables containing package info, dependencies, entry points, and metadata",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks; static configuration only",
  "flows": "Static data passed directly into setup() without dynamic or external data flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that are nonsensical; no malicious code or dynamic execution present",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted data sources are present. The obfuscation is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The variables are static, and the setup process appears legitimate. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or URLs are detected. The absence of malicious payloads, external data handling, or suspicious operations indicates a low security risk. The obfuscation may be an attempt to conceal or complicate analysis but does not constitute malicious behavior based on static inspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, static package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation alone warrants cautious review but does not elevate the security risk significantly.",
