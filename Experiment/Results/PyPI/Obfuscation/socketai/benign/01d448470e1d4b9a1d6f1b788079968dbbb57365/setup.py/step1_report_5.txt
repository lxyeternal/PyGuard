  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'r2v64vr6ui1t4up4', including dependencies, entry points, and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading package dependencies, package data, entry points, and package metadata from defined variables and the setup() function call.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function, which registers package installation details; no external untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from defined variables into the setup() function parameters; no dynamic or untrusted data processing detected.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., IHWYagyBKSbsCHeBwObJqcmKTiDgdgPN) and obfuscated-looking code, but no actual malicious code present. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious functions detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points for a Python package using setuptools. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but the content is consistent with typical setup scripts. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The code does not include any code that manipulates or leaks data, nor does it contain backdoors or malicious payloads. It appears to be a standard package setup with obfuscated variable names.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected. No malware or suspicious activity is present based on this code.",
