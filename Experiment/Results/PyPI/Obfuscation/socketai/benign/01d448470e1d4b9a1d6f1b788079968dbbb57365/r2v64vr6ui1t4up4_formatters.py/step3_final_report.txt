  "purpose": "Generate string representations of Spark schemas for visualization or debugging.",
  "sources": "Input: StructType, ArrayType, StructField objects; Data traversed recursively within functions.",
  "sinks": "Internal string formatting; no external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Recursive traversal from schema objects (sources) to formatted string outputs (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with meaningless class/method names; some variables (e.g., 'delim', 'joined_lines') are undefined, indicating incomplete or intentionally obscured code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines utility functions to produce string representations of Spark SQL data types, including nested structures. Obfuscation obscures readability but does not alter core functionality. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The obfuscation appears to serve concealment or code compression purposes rather than malicious intent. The code is consistent with schema visualization utilities, and no security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign schema pretty-printer for Spark DataTypes, heavily obfuscated but without malicious behavior. It poses minimal security risk, primarily related to obfuscation, which does not indicate malicious intent. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate.",
