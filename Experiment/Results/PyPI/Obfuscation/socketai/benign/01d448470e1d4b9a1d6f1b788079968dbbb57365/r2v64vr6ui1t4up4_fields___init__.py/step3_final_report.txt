{
  "purpose": "Static import statements defining data type classes with obfuscated names, likely schema or configuration components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'sparkql.fields.atomic', 'sparkql.fields.array', and 'sparkql.fields.struct' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations; static module with no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; purely static import and export definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, nonsensical class names suggesting autogenerated or intentionally obscured code; no executable logic or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with highly obfuscated class names, indicating either autogenerated code or obfuscation for concealment. No dynamic code, network activity, or data processing is present. The obfuscated names do not inherently imply malicious intent, especially in a schema or data type definition context. The absence of suspicious patterns, data leaks, or malicious behaviors supports a benign assessment. The high obfuscation score aligns with the obscure identifiers, but malware and security risks are minimal given the static nature. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: 0 or 0.2, obfuscated: ~0.75) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static module with obfuscated class names, likely autogenerated or intentionally obscured, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security threats. The scores are appropriate and reflect the static, non-malicious nature of the code.",
