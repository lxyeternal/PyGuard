  "purpose": "Evaluate the provided Python code for potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks related to supply chain threats.",
  "sources": "The function accepts a schema object, which can be a class or instance, and calls two obfuscated methods on it: RMyATkCAXvSxtcqJAJjaZtpABfMLDicc() and UKEbtBlQIaUuQoyhjVkRtXdNHmcmDltZ.",
  "sinks": "The method calls on 'schema_object' could potentially invoke malicious code if the methods are maliciously overridden or manipulated, especially if 'schema_object' is untrusted.",
  "flows": "Input 'schema_object' flows into method calls with obfuscated names, whose execution results are returned as a StructType; if these methods are malicious, they could perform harmful actions during invocation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated method names, conditional import for type hints, and dynamic method invocation on an untrusted object are suspicious and indicative of obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code accepts a schema object and invokes two methods with nonsensical names, returning the result as a StructType. The obfuscation of method names is suspicious, as it can hide malicious intent or malicious code execution. The conditional import is standard for type hints and not inherently malicious. No explicit malicious actions such as network access or data exfiltration are evident statically. The dynamic invocation pattern could be exploited if 'schema_object' is malicious or manipulated. The obfuscation suggests potential concealment, warranting caution. The scores should reflect high obfuscation (0.8), low to moderate malware likelihood (0.2-0.4), and moderate security risk (around 0.5). Further dynamic analysis or review of the actual method implementations is recommended before trusting or deploying this code.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation, which is a red flag for potential malicious intent, but no direct malicious actions are confirmed. The pattern suggests possible concealment of malicious behavior, warranting further investigation. The security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic invocation, but static analysis alone does not confirm malicious activity.",
