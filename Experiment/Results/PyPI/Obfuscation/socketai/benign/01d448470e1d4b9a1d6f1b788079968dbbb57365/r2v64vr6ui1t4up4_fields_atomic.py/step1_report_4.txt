{
  "purpose": "Define custom types and property methods for data type classes, likely used for schema definitions in Spark applications.",
  "sources": "Import statements from datetime, typing, decimal, and pyspark.sql.types; references to other modules (sparkql.fields.base).",
  "sinks": "Methods like TgfpcKNQcFBrbjdyHxKdLeLcDDlsdKWQ that call external functions and super().TgfpcKNQcFBrbjdyHxKdLeLcDDlsdKWQ, potentially passing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class initializations and method calls where input parameters are passed to external functions or super() methods, but mostly within class property methods.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated class and method names that lack semantic clarity, which can be suspicious. The use of dynamic typing and property methods returning type objects is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors detected. No external network activity or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several classes representing data types, with properties returning specific Spark data type classes, and methods that invoke superclass methods and external functions, possibly for schema or type validation. The obfuscated naming makes static analysis difficult, but the code appears to serve as a type/schema definition module without any active malicious behavior or data leaks. No suspicious network activity or credential handling. The code structure suggests it’s part of a larger system for schema management, with no direct signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of type definitions and schema property classes, with obfuscated names but no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It does not exhibit malware traits such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The obfuscation may be for code hiding or simply a naming pattern. Overall security risk is low.",
