{
  "purpose": "Define custom data type classes for use with Spark SQL, mapping to Spark SQL types, and provide property methods for type annotations and configuration.",
  "sources": "Import statements for standard libraries and specific Spark SQL types; class property methods; constructor parameters for decimal precision/scale.",
  "sinks": "Super class method calls and type return statements; no direct data output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Class property methods return type classes; methods passing untrusted input to superclass methods and type constructors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and method names; unconventional class and method naming; no apparent hardcoded secrets or credentials; reliance on super() method calls without visible implementation details; the dynamic type creation with decimal and float types appears standard. No suspicious data leaks or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple classes for data type mappings, inheriting from base classes, with properties returning Spark SQL type classes. Constructor parameters configure decimal precision and scale. Methods primarily call superclass methods and invoke type constructors. The code appears to implement a data type abstraction layer, with no signs of malicious behavior, hidden data exfiltration, or backdoors. Obfuscation in naming is likely for code obfuscation or naming conventions but does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, credential handling, or system modification observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard implementation of data type classes for Spark SQL, with obfuscated naming but no malicious behavior detected. It functions as a type mapping layer without any evident malicious or security-risk activities.",
