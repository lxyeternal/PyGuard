{
  "purpose": "Defines custom data type classes for Spark SQL, providing type properties and methods for handling data types, likely for schema registration or validation.",
  "sources": "Imports of standard libraries, third-party Spark SQL types, and application-specific modules; class property methods and initializers reading class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Property methods returning data type classes; external function calls passing data types, possibly for registration or validation purposes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from property access to external function calls, with class inheritance and method invocations establishing type definitions and registrations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; external functions with non-descriptive names such as 'BzRpXskFqKlPToHcCDRmdhxmdcJXTtwN'; no hardcoded secrets or network activity; indirect calls with class types that could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions mapping to Spark SQL data types, with property methods returning type classes and external functions invoked with these types. The obfuscated naming conventions suggest code obfuscation or generated code, but no malicious payloads or behaviors are evident. External functions like 'BzRpXskFqKlPToHcCDRmdhxmdcJXTtwN' are likely for registration or validation, common in schema management. The code does not perform network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The obfuscation increases suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to serve schema/type registration purposes in a Spark environment, with minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of schema/type class definitions for Spark SQL, with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious activity or malware. External function calls are likely legitimate registration or validation functions. The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible.",
