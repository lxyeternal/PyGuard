  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Spark schema validation and merging utility. Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The high obfuscation score reflects naming obscurity but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use in production, with the caveat to monitor for runtime behaviors."
