  "purpose": "Utility functions for merging and validating Spark SQL data types and schemas.",
  "sources": "Reads Spark schema objects, data types, and metadata attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external data output or network activity; internal schema validation and merging.",
  "flows": "Validation of data types and metadata, merging schemas, raising exceptions on conflicts.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and function names, but no malicious code or behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs schema validation and merging for Spark DataTypes, with extensive type and metadata checks. Obfuscated naming is present but appears stylistic or proprietary, not malicious. No external data flows, network activity, or system modifications are evident. Exception handling enforces schema consistency. The logic is consistent with a schema utility module, with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Spark schema validation and merging utility. Despite obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage. The high obfuscation score reflects naming obscurity but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code is low risk and safe for use in production, with the caveat to monitor for runtime behaviors.",
