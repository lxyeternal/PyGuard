{
  "purpose": "Static import module from 'sparkql' with obfuscated identifiers, likely for internal use or size optimization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'sparkql' modules, no user input or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no external network interactions.",
  "flows": "Import statements are static; no data flow from sources to sinks involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, which may be intentional or obfuscation for concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, no dynamic code execution, data processing, or network activity. Obfuscation is present but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. Malware scores are zero, risk scores are very low, and confidence is high that the code is benign. The obfuscation is the only notable feature, but without evidence of malicious behavior, it does not elevate concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, obfuscated import module with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The obfuscation warrants acknowledgment but does not suggest malicious intent based on this static analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "malware": 0,
