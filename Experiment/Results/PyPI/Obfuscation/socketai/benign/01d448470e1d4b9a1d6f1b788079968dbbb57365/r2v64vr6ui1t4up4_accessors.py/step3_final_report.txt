  "purpose": "Utility functions for extracting attributes from an obfuscated class, likely used in Spark data processing pipelines.",
  "sources": "Attribute access on the class PIlcBrdHKgPBdFePvVfdGrSlawAZCvgY, which is imported and used as input parameter in each function.",
  "sinks": "None; the functions only return attribute values, with no external output, network calls, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Input object -> attribute access -> return value; no external data flow or code execution observed.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation in class and attribute names; no comments or documentation; functions are simple getters which could be used to hide complex logic or data.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward attribute accessors on an obfuscated class, with no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The heavy obfuscation raises suspicion but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The functions do not perform any data transformation or external communication. The absence of hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns suggests benign utility code, although the obfuscation warrants cautious review. The malware score should reflect the low likelihood of malicious intent, but the obfuscation justifies a slightly elevated obfuscated score.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions with heavily obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks based solely on this snippet. The obfuscation warrants further review of the broader codebase, but the current assessment indicates low malware and security risk. The scores should be set accordingly.",
