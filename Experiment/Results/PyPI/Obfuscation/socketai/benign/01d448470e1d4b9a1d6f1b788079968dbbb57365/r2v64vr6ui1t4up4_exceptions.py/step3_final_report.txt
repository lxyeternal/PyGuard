  "purpose": "Defines obfuscated exception classes and a complex data validation class for structured message construction.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for message formatting within class constructors.",
  "sinks": "No external data, network activity, or data leaks; primarily message construction.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> message construction in class methods -> exception raising or data handling (if any).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and constants; no external input handling or malicious code; complex constructor logic may obscure intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple exception classes with obfuscated names and string constants, primarily used for structured error and message formatting. No external input, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment or stylistic reasons, not malicious intent. The code does not perform any harmful operations, system modifications, or data leaks. The high obfuscation score (0.8) is justified by the naming style, but the malware score remains at 0 due to lack of malicious behavior. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects the benign nature of the code, which is mainly class definitions and message formatting logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but benign, serving as structured exception and message classes without any signs of malicious activity or security threats. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with high obfuscation but no malware or active risks.",
