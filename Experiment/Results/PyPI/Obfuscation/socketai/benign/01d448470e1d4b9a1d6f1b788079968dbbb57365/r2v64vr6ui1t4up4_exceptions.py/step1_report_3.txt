  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a detailed structured error message class with dynamic message generation based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "Class __init__ method of MHizbRUKEiJVQVfKRsXfDbIGfiJZVklr, specifically the parameters sIIeEtcdVXIMeaIuTTVFWGOZFMIGBkfx, tBTvlARlEXctkAhsEeTfqcwbMjonGFqH, rzjZOhUdYSZrcJFtgTllCaLeGCjKapDb, and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "String concatenation and join operations that construct error messages, potential for injection if input data is untrusted (though the code does not explicitly handle external input), or to craft malicious messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to the constructor are combined and formatted into a detailed message string, which is then passed to the superclass Exception for raising.",
  "anomalies": "No use of eval, exec, or dynamic code execution; no hardcoded credentials or secret tokens; no network activity or system modifications. The class appears purely for structured error reporting.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple exception classes with hardcoded string attributes, which alone are benign. The main class, MHizbRUKEiJVQVfKRsXfDbIGfiJZVklr, constructs an error message dynamically based on its input parameters, providing detailed error descriptions. This is standard error handling logic. No external input handling or data transmission, no obfuscation or malicious code patterns observed. The overall structure appears legitimate and intended for detailed exception reporting without any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of custom exception classes with a detailed error message constructor. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware, only structured error reporting logic. No indicators of supply chain attacks or malicious activities are present.",
