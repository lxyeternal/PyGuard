{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some with hardcoded string attributes, and a complex subclass of an exception that constructs a detailed message based on input parameters.",
  "sources": "No external data input or untrusted data sources are explicitly read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks, network communications, or insecure data handling occurs here.",
  "flows": "The class '__init__' method in 'MHizbRUKEiJVQVfKRsXfDbIGfiJZVklr' constructs a message string based on input parameters, then passes it to the superclass constructor.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of numerous obfuscated class and variable names, along with strings assigned to class attributes that resemble hardcoded secrets. The structure appears intentionally complex, potentially to obscure intent. The class 'MHizbRUKEiJVQVfKRsXfDbIGfiJZVklr' generates a descriptive message that includes multiple string joins and conditionals, but no direct malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of custom exception classes with hardcoded string attributes, which are not inherently malicious. The large class with an elaborate constructor constructs detailed messages based on input lists, which could be used for logging or debugging. No network activity, data exfiltration, code execution, or obfuscation techniques are evident. The use of intentionally obscure variable names and string attributes suggests an attempt at concealment, but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malware such as reverse shells, data theft, or system damage mechanisms.\n\nOverall, the code appears to be benign in behavior, with obfuscation potentially masking non-malicious purposes, such as complex error reporting or structured exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated in naming and structure but does not contain any clear malicious behavior or security risks. The strings assigned to class attributes might suggest hidden secrets, but without external context, they do not imply malicious intent. The primary function is custom exception handling with detailed messaging, which is not suspicious.",
