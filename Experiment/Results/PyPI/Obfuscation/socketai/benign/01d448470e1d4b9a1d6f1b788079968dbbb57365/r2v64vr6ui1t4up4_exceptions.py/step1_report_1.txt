  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and a specialized class for structured data validation and messaging.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; the code defines classes and constants only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only constructs messages and class hierarchies.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of numerous classes with obfuscated-looking names and constants with random strings. The class 'MHizbRUKEiJVQVfKRsXfDbIGfiJZVklr' has a complex constructor with multiple parameters but only performs string concatenations and class inheritance. No actual input parsing, network communication, or data processing observed.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of class definitions, including custom exceptions with obfuscated or nonsensical class names and constants. The main functional class 'MHizbRUKEiJVQVfKRsXfDbIGfiJZVklr' constructs detailed messages based on its parameters but does not perform any operations that could be malicious. No external data sources, sinks, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, file modifications, or code execution are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be harmless, serving primarily to define structured exception classes and a data validation message generator. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks in this module.",
