  "purpose": "Gene data retrieval from Neo4j graph database, querying entity contexts and labels based on input gene names.",
  "sources": "Input parameters (gene names), database query results (entity context and labels).",
  "sinks": "Database query execution, returning gene context information.",
  "flows": "Input gene list -> dynamic Cypher query construction -> database execution -> retrieval of context data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of string concatenation for Cypher query construction involving labels and candidates, potential Cypher injection risk; obfuscated variable names; presence of print statements for debugging.",
  "analysis": "The code performs gene-related data retrieval from a Neo4j database, constructing Cypher queries dynamically via string concatenation, which introduces a potential Cypher injection vector if inputs are untrusted. Variable names are obfuscated, but this appears stylistic rather than malicious. No network, file, or system modification activities are present. The code does not contain malicious payloads or backdoors. The main security concern is ensuring input sanitization or parameterization to prevent injection. The presence of debug print statements should be addressed for production use. Overall, the code is a legitimate utility with moderate obfuscation and a low to moderate injection risk, but no malware or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign gene data retrieval component with obfuscated variable names and dynamic query construction that could pose a Cypher injection risk if inputs are not sanitized. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. To enhance security, inputs should be sanitized or parameterized, and debug statements should be removed. The overall security posture is low risk, with the primary concern being injection mitigation.",
