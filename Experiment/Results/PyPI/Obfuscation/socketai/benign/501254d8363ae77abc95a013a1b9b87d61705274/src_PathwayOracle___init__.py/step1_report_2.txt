{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python script that performs some data processing and possibly interacts with external resources or user input.",
  "sources": "Input from user prompts, environment variables, or external network calls (if any are present in the code).",
  "sinks": "Potential output functions like print statements, file writes, or network transmissions where untrusted data could leak or cause side effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables to sinks such as output functions or network calls, possibly through data processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual patterns such as dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or use of suspicious libraries. Any use of eval, exec, or similar functions should be scrutinized.",
  "analysis": "Step-by-step review of the code reveals no signs of malicious payloads. The code utilizes standard libraries and functions. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated sections are present. The data flow appears to be typical of data processing scripts. The code does not perform any suspicious file operations, network communications, or credential theft. Overall, it seems to be a legitimate utility with no immediate security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal, functional script without any indicators of malware or security threats.",
