  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, likely intended for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit purpose evident from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly visible; the code does not show direct data input mechanisms such as reading files, network requests, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that perform system modifications, network communications, or execute dynamic code; however, none are explicitly identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident; the code lacks identifiable source-to-sink paths.",
  "anomalies": "There are no apparent hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. No obfuscated code or suspicious dynamic execution is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, without complex control flow, obfuscated sections, or suspicious behavior. It lacks external data input and does not perform network operations or system modifications. Based on the provided snippet, there are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security vulnerabilities based on the provided content.",
