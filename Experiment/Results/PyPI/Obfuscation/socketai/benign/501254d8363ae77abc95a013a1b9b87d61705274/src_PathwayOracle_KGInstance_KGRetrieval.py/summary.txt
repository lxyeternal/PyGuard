  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and interacts with an external component via a dynamic invoke method, which could be exploited for malicious purposes if compromised. No explicit malicious payloads are present, but the external invocation and obfuscation increase the risk profile. The overall security risk is moderate, and further investigation into the external 'invoke' function is recommended."
