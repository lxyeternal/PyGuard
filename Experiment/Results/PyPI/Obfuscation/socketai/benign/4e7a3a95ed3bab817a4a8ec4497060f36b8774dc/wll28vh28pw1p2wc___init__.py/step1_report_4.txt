  "purpose": "Import specific handlers from the 'rlog.handlers' module and assign a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'rlog.handlers' module; reading the module and the imported symbols.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks related to untrusted data or output; the code only performs an import and variable assignment.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads module components; variable assignment sets a static version string. No data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbols 'aOQJEdnAItdgYEmzCfQhNwdGXfMcLuQN' and 'NfpOLDaDOYUzwqDrELPBKhqpZrKujtIX' are non-descriptive, seemingly random strings; no context provided. The import source is ambiguous, and the symbol names suggest obfuscation or code concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a minimal import from a potentially obscure module, with symbols that appear to be random or obfuscated. The version string assigned is harmless. The absence of further code or context limits understanding, but the suspiciously non-descriptive symbol names and the lack of any further logic or functionality raise concern about obfuscation or concealed behavior. Without additional context, the code seems benign but could be part of obfuscated or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet imports obfuscated symbols from a module and assigns a version string, with no explicit malicious actions. However, the non-descriptive identifiers and lack of context suggest possible obfuscation or concealment of malicious intent. The overall risk is moderate due to ambiguity, and further investigation of the module and surrounding code is recommended.",
