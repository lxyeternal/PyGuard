  "purpose": "Importing mocking tools for testing purposes",
  "sources": "The code reads the 'unittest.mock' module or fallback 'mock' module if the first is unavailable",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or user input is processed or used",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as this code only imports modules without further data flow",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code performs a standard import with a fallback mechanism",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'patch' and 'Mock' from 'unittest.mock' for testing purposes; if unavailable (e.g., Python version < 3.3), it falls back to importing from the external 'mock' package. This is a common pattern to ensure compatibility across Python versions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility import pattern for testing modules, with no malicious intent or security concerns detected.",
