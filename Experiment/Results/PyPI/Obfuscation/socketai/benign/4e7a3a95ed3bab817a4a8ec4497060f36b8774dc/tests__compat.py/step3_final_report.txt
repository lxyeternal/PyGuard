  "purpose": "Conditional import of testing utilities ('patch' and 'Mock') with fallback for compatibility across Python versions.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'unittest.mock' or 'mock' package",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "None; standard fallback pattern, no suspicious or unusual code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward conditional import to support different Python versions. It does not process or transmit data, does not execute untrusted code, and contains no obfuscation or malicious constructs. The fallback pattern is common and safe. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present. The code's purpose is solely for testing setup, with no security implications.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard practice for compatibility, and poses no security threat. All signals indicate no malware, obfuscation, or security risk.",
