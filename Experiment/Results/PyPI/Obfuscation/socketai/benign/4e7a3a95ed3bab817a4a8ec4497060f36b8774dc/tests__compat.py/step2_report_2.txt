  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- The code is a simple import statement with a fallback, used for testing purposes.\n- No data is processed, transmitted, or stored.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior.\n- The fallback pattern is a common practice for compatibility across Python versions.\n- The malware score is consistently 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The security risk score is 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly identify that the code is a straightforward import with fallback, used in testing setups. No issues or malicious behavior are present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- **Logical or reasoning errors?**  \n  No. All reports correctly interpret the code as benign and standard.\n\n- **Scores assigned?**  \n  The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate. The security risk scores are also 0, consistent with the benign nature.\n\n### Potential points of contention:\n- The reports assign a confidence of 1, which is justified given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n- The obfuscated score is 0, which is correct; the code is not obfuscated.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n**The code is a standard, benign pattern for importing testing utilities with version compatibility.**  \n**No malicious, obfuscated, or security issues are present.**  \n**Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.**\n\n---\n\n**My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the provided reports and the actual code behavior.",
