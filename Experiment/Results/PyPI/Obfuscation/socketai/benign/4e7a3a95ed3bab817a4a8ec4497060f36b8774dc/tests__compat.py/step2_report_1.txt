  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall assessment:**\n- The code snippets are simple import statements for testing utilities, with a fallback to maintain compatibility across Python versions.\n- No data flows, sinks, or sources are involved.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior are present.\n- The purpose is clearly for testing, not production logic or data handling.\n\n**Specific observations:**\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n- The fallback pattern (try-import, except ImportError) is standard and common in open-source projects supporting multiple Python versions.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are evident.\n- The code does not process untrusted data, connect to external systems, or contain any suspicious constructs.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which is appropriate. No malware or malicious behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward, readable code.\n- **Risk score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Potential issues or concerns:**\n- The only point to consider is whether the fallback import could be exploited, but in this context, it's a benign pattern and widely accepted.\n\n**Final assessment:**\n- The code is entirely benign.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.\n- No changes are necessary.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious intent or activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk associated)\n\nThis code snippet is standard, benign, and poses no security threat.",
