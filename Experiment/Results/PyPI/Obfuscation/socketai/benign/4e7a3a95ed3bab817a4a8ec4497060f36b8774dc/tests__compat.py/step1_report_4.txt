  "purpose": "This code attempts to import mocking utilities for testing purposes, with a fallback for older Python versions.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module import statements.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or potential vulnerabilities are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving user input or untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are present. The fallback import pattern is standard for compatibility.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose is to import 'patch' and 'Mock' from 'unittest.mock' if available, otherwise from 'mock' for compatibility. This is common in test setups. No data input, data leakage, or malicious actions are evident. The code is straightforward and uses standard Python practices without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a compatibility role for testing frameworks. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected.",
