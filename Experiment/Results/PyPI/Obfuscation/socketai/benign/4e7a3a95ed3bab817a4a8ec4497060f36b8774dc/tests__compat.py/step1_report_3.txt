  "purpose": "Import mocking tools for testing purposes, typically used in unit tests.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; import statements only.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import to ensure compatibility across environments, standard practice for test setups; no suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'patch' and 'Mock' from 'unittest.mock', falling back to 'mock' if ImportError occurs, which is a common compatibility pattern for supporting older Python versions prior to 3.3. There are no data inputs, no data processing, no untrusted data sources, and no suspicious or malicious code. The code appears to be boilerplate for testing environments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard compatibility snippet for importing testing mock objects and shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
