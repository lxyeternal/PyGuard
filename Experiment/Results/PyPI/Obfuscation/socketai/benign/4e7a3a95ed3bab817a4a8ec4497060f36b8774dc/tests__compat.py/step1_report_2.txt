{
  "purpose": "Import mock-related modules for testing purposes, compatible with different Python versions.",
  "sources": "The import statements read the 'unittest.mock' module or fallback to 'mock' if ImportError occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import 'patch' and 'Mock' from 'unittest.mock' (standard in Python 3.3+). If not available, it falls back to the third-party 'mock' library for compatibility with earlier Python versions. The structure is straightforward, with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. It solely sets up imports for testing utilities, with no indication of malicious intent or malicious code behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, used for importing testing utilities with version compatibility considerations. No malicious or security issues are present.",
