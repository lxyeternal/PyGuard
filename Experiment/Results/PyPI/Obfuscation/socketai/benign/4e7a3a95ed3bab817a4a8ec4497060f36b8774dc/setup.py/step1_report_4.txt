{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that depends on Redis and optionally on ujson and mock for testing.",
  "sources": "Imports from sys and setuptools; data in dictionaries for dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None of the code explicitly writes or executes untrusted input; no network connections, file operations, or dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "N/A - no flow of untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; unclear strings like 'wll28vh28pw1p2wc' and 'lobziik.o@gmail.com' appear in metadata, but they are likely just package info. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration using setuptools. It conditionally adds dependencies based on environment info and sets package metadata. The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are apparent. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup with minor obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign setup script for a Python package with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscated variable names may reduce clarity but do not indicate malicious intent.",
