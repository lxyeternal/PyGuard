{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, defining dependencies and metadata for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reads environment info via sys and sys.version_info; static strings for package metadata; dependencies listed in dictionaries.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network calls, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; dependencies are statically defined; no dynamic data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; superficial obfuscation without actual malicious code; static metadata with no secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not malicious. No network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration is evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hinder readability but not to conceal malicious intent. Dependencies are standard, and metadata is static and benign. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation may raise suspicion but does not translate into malicious behavior. The malware score should remain at 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The obfuscation score can be moderately high (around 0.3-0.4) due to variable name obfuscation but not excessive. The security risk score remains low (~0.2), given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated package setup script with superficial obfuscation and no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute a security threat. Scores should reflect no malware, moderate obfuscation, and low risk.",
