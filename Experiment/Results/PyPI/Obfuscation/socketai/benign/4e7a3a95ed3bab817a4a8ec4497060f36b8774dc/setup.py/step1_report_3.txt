{
  "purpose": "This code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, specifying dependencies and metadata for package distribution.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'sys' module to determine environment specifics; it also includes hardcoded package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The code does not process untrusted input or data that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "The script flow depends on environment checks ('sys' attributes and version info) to conditionally append dependencies, then calls 'setup()' with static metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and strings such as 'vzJcVkrHceFJnxurvVbTIrhHadjwFTQr' and 'wll28vh28pw1p2wc', which may be attempts to hide meaningful data. The email string is obfuscated, but it is just a typical email. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is evident. No suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a standard package setup script with some obfuscated variable names, which might suggest an attempt to conceal intent. It conditionally adds dependencies based on environment info, which is typical in setup scripts. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling is observed. The obfuscation seems limited to variable naming rather than malicious obfuscation techniques. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or harmful actions. The code appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with obfuscated variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with minimal obfuscation in variable names. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected. The obfuscation appears superficial and is likely intended to hinder casual readability rather than conceal malicious intent.",
