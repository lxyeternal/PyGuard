  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables, imports modules, processes data, network communication, file operations, external modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data output, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, inputs) to processing functions, possibly to network or file sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, eval/exec, or suspicious patterns detected; code appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "All reports consistently indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Confidence levels are high (0.9) in most cases, and scores reflect minimal risk (0.2). No evidence of malware or obfuscation is present. The reasoning across reports is coherent and aligns with the low-risk assessment. Given the lack of concrete code snippets, the cautious low risk score is appropriate. No significant anomalies or threats are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
