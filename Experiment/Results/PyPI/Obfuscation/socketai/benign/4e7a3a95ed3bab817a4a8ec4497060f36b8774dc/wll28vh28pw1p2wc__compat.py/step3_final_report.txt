  "purpose": "Detects Python version and environment, attempts to import 'ujson' for performance, falling back to 'json'.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, hasattr(sys, 'pypy_translation_info'), sys module, import statements",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no malicious data processing",
  "flows": "Environment detection variables to import logic, no external data flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of dynamic import with fallback",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard environment detection and JSON library import with obfuscated variable names. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity, or execute malicious logic. The obfuscation appears to be solely in variable naming, not in code behavior. No security vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The import fallback is a common performance optimization, and environment checks are standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving compatibility and performance purposes. Obfuscated variable names are not indicative of malicious intent but justify a moderate obfuscation score. No malware or security risks are present.",
