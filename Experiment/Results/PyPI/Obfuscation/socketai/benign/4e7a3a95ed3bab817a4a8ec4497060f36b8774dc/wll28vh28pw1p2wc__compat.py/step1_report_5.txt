  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names that do not convey purpose, which could be an attempt to hide intent. No hardcoded credentials, malicious functions, or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python interpreter version (Python 2 or 3) and whether it's running under PyPy, setting variables accordingly. It then attempts to import the 'ujson' library as 'json' for faster JSON parsing; if unavailable, it defaults to the standard 'json' library. The obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to obscure the code's intent but do not indicate malicious behavior. The code performs environment detection and imports a JSON library without any data processing, network communication, or untrusted data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard environment detection and library import logic, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or suspicious behavior. There are no signs of malware or security risks.",
