  "purpose": "Determine Python version and environment, and import a JSON library (preferably ujson if available).",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, hasattr(sys, 'pypy_translation_info')",
  "sinks": "import statements for ujson or json",
  "flows": "Read Python version info and environment attributes, then conditionally set type aliases; attempt to import ujson or fallback to json",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code; standard environment checks and conditional import for JSON library",
  "analysis": "The code checks for Python 2 or 3 and for PyPy environment, then sets a type alias accordingly. It attempts to import ujson as a faster JSON parser, falling back to the standard json module if unavailable. These are common, benign practices to ensure compatibility and performance. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are present. No obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or data leaks are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard environment and version detection code combined with a conditional import for a JSON parsing library. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this snippet.",
