{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to set up compatibility variables for Python 2 and 3, and to import a JSON parsing library, preferring ujson if available.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, hasattr(sys, 'pypy_translation_info')",
  "sinks": "Import statement importing ujson or json",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> boolean checks; import statement -> JSON library",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious variable names, and no unusual behavior; the code appears straightforward and standard for compatibility setup.",
  "analysis": "The code begins by checking the Python version to assign booleans for Python 2 and 3, then checks for PyPy presence. It sets a variable for string types based on Python version. It attempts to import 'ujson' for faster JSON processing, falling back to the standard 'json' if unavailable. All operations are typical for compatibility purposes and do not contain obfuscated code or malicious patterns. No data leaks, code injection, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for compatibility and performance optimization. There are no signs of malicious intent or malicious code, and the logic is clear and typical.",
