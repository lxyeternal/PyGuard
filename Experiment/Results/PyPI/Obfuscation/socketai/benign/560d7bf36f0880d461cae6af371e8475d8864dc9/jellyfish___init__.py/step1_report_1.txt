  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, with no explicit malicious intent evident from the visible code.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from variables, function arguments, or possibly environment variables, but no clear external sources such as network inputs, files, or user prompts are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands, but no such actions are explicitly shown in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no observable data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks within the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are detected. No dynamic code execution or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears straightforward with typical Python functions and control structures. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are identified. Since the code is minimal and lacks external interactions, no malicious activities are inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign and does not exhibit suspicious or harmful patterns.",
