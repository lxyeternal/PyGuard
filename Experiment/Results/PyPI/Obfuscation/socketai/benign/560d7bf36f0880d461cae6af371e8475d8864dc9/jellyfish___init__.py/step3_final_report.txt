  "analysis": "All reports indicate no code or benign code with low suspicion. The most notable point is that Report 2 suggests signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting a slightly higher malware score. The other reports are consistent with their assessments. Adjustments are recommended only for Report 2, increasing its malware score from 0.2 to 0.4 to better reflect suspicion. For Report 4, reducing the security risk from 0.3 to 0.2 aligns better with the benign assessment. Overall, the conservative scores are appropriate given the lack of code snippets.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify benign or unassessable code, with a slight suspicion in Report 2 that justifies increasing its malware score. Adjustments improve alignment with observed signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution. The overall security posture remains low risk.",
