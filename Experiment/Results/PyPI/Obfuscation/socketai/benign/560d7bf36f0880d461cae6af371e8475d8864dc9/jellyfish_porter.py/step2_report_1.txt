  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of code, potential security issues, and the consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Content:** Clearly states it's a fragment of linguistic or phonetic rules, not executable code.\n- **Analysis:** No code, data flow, or malicious patterns. The report's conclusion aligns with this.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 1 (high certainty).\n- **Assessment:** Correctly identifies this as benign, non-executable linguistic note.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Content:** Similar to Report 1, describing a linguistic rule about the letter 'c' not followed by w, x, or y, used in restoring 'e' at the end of words like 'cave', 'love', etc.\n- **Analysis:** No executable code, data flow, or malicious activity. It’s a comment or partial rule.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.8 — seems high given the benign nature.\n- **Justification for risk score:** Since it's just a linguistic rule comment, the risk should be minimal. Unless there's context suggesting this is part of a larger system with vulnerabilities, a risk of 0.2 or 0.3 would be more appropriate.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score appears inflated; I recommend lowering it to 0.2 or 0.3, as there's no evidence of security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Content:** Again, a comment or partial rule about linguistic processing, restoring 'e' in words.\n- **Analysis:** No executable code or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9 — again, high for a benign comment.\n- **Justification:** Similar to above, unless there's an underlying system vulnerability, this should not be considered high risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score should be lowered to about 0.2 or 0.3 for consistency.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Content:** Same pattern—a linguistic note, not executable code.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.9 — again, possibly overestimating risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** The risk score should be reduced accordingly.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Content:** Similar to previous, describing a linguistic rule.\n- **Analysis:** No executable code or malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.8 — likely too high.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** Should be lowered to reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n\n- All reports are describing linguistic or phonetic rules, not executable code.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent.\n- The risk scores in reports 2-5 are inflated given the benign content; they should be closer to 0.2–0.3.\n- Malware scores are correctly zero across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- **Malware scores:** Keep at 0 for all reports.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Correctly 0.\n- **Risk scores:** Should be lowered from 0.8–0.9 to about 0.2–0.3, reflecting the non-security nature of the content.\n\n### Overall estimated scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 across the board.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.\n- **Risk:** ~0.2–0.3, since these are benign linguistic notes with no security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are benign, describing linguistic rules, with no malicious or obfuscated code. The risk scores are overestimated and should be adjusted downward for consistency.",
