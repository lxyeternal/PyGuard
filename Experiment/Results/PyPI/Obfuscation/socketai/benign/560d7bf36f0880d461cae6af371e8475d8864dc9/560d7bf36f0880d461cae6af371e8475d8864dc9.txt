      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated but benign setup script for a Python package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack vectors. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or risk scores. The current scores (malware: 0.0-0.1, obfuscated: 0.7, risk: 0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
