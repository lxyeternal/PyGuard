{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a minimal script header, including a shebang line and encoding declaration, with no executable logic.",
  "sources": "The code reads input only from the environment or command line when executed; no data sources are explicitly present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects, as no code executes beyond headers.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist; the snippet contains only comments and directives.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely boilerplate with a shebang and encoding comment, containing no executable or malicious code. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning zero scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk. The structure and content are straightforward, with no anomalies or suspicious elements. Given the absence of executable logic or data handling, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is harmless, serving as a placeholder or script header. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. All reports are accurate and consistent; no further action or concern is warranted.",
