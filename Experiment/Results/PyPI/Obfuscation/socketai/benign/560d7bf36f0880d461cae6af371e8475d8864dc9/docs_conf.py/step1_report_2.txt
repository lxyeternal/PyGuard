{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a shebang line and encoding declaration, typically used at the start of Python scripts to specify interpreter and character encoding.",
  "sources": "No actual code, data input, or external sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond the initial script declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Only the shebang and encoding comment are present; no executable or suspicious code is included.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only the shebang line '#!/usr/bin/env python3' and encoding declaration '# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-'. These are standard and harmless directives that specify how the script should be executed and how characters are encoded. There is no executable logic, no input/output operations, no imports, and no potentially malicious constructs. This fragment alone cannot perform any malicious activity or contain malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is solely the standard header for a Python script indicating the interpreter and encoding. It does not contain any executable code, data handling, or malicious behavior. No security risks are present.",
