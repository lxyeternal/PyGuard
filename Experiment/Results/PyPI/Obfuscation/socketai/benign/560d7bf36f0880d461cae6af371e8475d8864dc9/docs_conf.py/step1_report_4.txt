  "purpose": "The code appears to be a shebang line and a coding declaration, likely serving as a script entry point or script metadata.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow present in the given fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains shebang and encoding declaration lines; no executable logic or suspicious constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is minimal, consisting solely of a shebang line and an encoding declaration. These are standard boilerplate lines indicating script interpreter and character encoding. There are no inputs, outputs, data flows, or executable logic to analyze for malicious activity. Without additional code, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is a typical header for a Python script with no executable or suspicious components.",
