  "purpose": "The provided code only contains a coding declaration indicating UTF-8 encoding, with no executable logic or functional content.",
  "sources": "No data input, external data reading, or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No output, data processing, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input-output pathways, or logic flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any code beyond encoding declaration; no suspicious, unusual, or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment is solely a comment specifying the source code's character encoding. It contains no functions, variables, imports, or executable statements. Without additional code, there are no source-to-sink data flows, no potential vulnerabilities, and no malicious activity. It appears to be a standard header or file encoding declaration often found at the top of Python files.",
  "conclusion": "There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in the provided snippet. It is a benign, minimal piece of code with no exploitable content.",
