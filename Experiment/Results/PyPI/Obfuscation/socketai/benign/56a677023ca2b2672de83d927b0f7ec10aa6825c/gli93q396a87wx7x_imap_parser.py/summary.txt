  "conclusion": "The code is a set of parser definitions for IMAP responses with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior or payloads. The malware score remains at 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to the inherent risks of parsing untrusted data but no active vulnerabilities or malicious actions are present."
