  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to a variable",
  "sources": "Assignment statement setting a variable to a string",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name; the variable name appears as a random string, which could be an obfuscation attempt but has no functional malicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name and a version string. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external data fetching, or network communication. The variable name looks obfuscated but may be arbitrary. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and appears to be a simple version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There are no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
