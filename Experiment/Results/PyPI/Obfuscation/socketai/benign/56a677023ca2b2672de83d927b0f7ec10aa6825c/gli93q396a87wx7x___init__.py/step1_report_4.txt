  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely indicating a package or module version.",
  "sources": "A hardcoded string assigned directly to a variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow to untrusted sinks or external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flow or input/output operations observed.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name (YDTpllsNfZBdMPfkrFJlizuutkSjoQSX) which appears to be random or obfuscated. No other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with a seemingly random variable name and a version string value. There are no inputs, no data processing, no external calls, or other code elements. The variable name does not suggest any malicious intent and appears to be obfuscated, but that alone does not imply malicious behavior. The content does not indicate malicious or suspicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be a benign variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code.",
