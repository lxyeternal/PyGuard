  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely indicating a package or module version.",
  "sources": "The variable assignment; no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing identified.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'YDTpllsNfZBdMPfkrFJlizuutkSjoQSX' appears to be a randomly generated string, which is unusual for a variable name. No other suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a variable assignment with an obfuscated or randomly generated variable name and a string value '1.2.0'. There are no functions, data input, network operations, or other behaviors that suggest malicious intent. The variable name's randomness could indicate obfuscation, but on its own, it does not imply malicious behavior. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign assignment of a version string to a obfuscated variable name. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
