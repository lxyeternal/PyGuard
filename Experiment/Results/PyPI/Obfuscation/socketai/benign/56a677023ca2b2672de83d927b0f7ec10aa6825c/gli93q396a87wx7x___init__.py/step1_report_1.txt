  "purpose": "Assign a version string to a variable.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement assigning a string to a variable",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified",
  "flows": "Not applicable; simple variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears as a random string, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no other suspicious code present",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '1.2.0' to a variable named 'YDTpllsNfZBdMPfkrFJlizuutkSjoQSX'. The variable name is a random, nonsensical string, which might suggest obfuscation or an autogenerated placeholder. There are no sources of untrusted input, no data flows, and no use of external libraries or network operations. The code is minimal and straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There are no malicious behaviors, security risks, or suspicious activities detected. The obfuscated variable name alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
