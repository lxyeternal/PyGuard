{
  "purpose": "Defines data classes and an enumeration for handling security statuses and configurations, possibly related to system or network policy management.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses and enum modules; class attributes; property method accessing class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data handling or external system interaction; no evident data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "Data flows from class attribute definitions and property calculations, but there are no external data or untrusted inputs involved.",
  "anomalies": "The class and variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could indicate code obfuscation or an attempt to hide intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of data class definitions with obfuscated names, an enum with descriptive status strings, and a property that combines boolean fields. There are no input sources, no external data access, no network calls, and no evident malicious logic. The code appears to be structurally normal but uses obfuscated identifiers, which could be an attempt to evade detection or conceal purpose. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious actions is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign in function, defining data structures for internal use with obfuscated naming. No malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident from the provided fragment.",
