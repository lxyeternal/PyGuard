{
  "purpose": "Defines data structures and an enum with obfuscated identifiers, likely for internal configuration or modeling purposes.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, property methods, and enum definitions; no external data sources or input handling present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; code is purely declarative with no side effects.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of data classes and enum usage; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks, as code is static.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, but no suspicious logic, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class and enum definitions with obfuscated identifiers, no external interactions, and no malicious logic. The obfuscation suggests concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Scores assigned by reports are consistent: malware score 0, low security risk (~0.2), high obfuscation (~0.75-0.8). No anomalies or suspicious behavior are present. The code appears benign, serving as internal data models or configuration structures.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, obfuscated but not malicious. The current scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No further action required.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
