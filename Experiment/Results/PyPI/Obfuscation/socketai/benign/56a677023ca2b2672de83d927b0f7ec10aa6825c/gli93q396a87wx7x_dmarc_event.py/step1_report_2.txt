  "purpose": "Defines data structures and enumerations for managing security-related statuses and configurations",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources present in this code snippet",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or external calls observed in this code",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks, as the code only declares classes and enums",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. Class names and variable names are obfuscated but that alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains data classes with obfuscated class and variable names, likely to conceal purpose but without any direct malicious activity. No external input handling, network calls, file operations, or code execution present. Enum defines status options. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The obfuscation might be for privacy or to evade detection but is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malware or malicious intent. It appears to be a standard, obfuscated data structure definition without any harmful behavior.",
