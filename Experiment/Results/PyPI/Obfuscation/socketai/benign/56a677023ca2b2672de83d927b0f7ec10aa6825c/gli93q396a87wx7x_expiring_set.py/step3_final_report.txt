{
  "purpose": "Implements an expiring set with serialization/deserialization, mainly for managing time-limited collections.",
  "sources": "Data from pickle files during load, data added via add() method.",
  "sinks": "Uses pickle.load() and pickle.dump() which can execute malicious code if files are tampered with.",
  "flows": "Data flows from files into internal structures via pickle, and from internal structures back into files.",
  "anomalies": "Use of pickle for serialization/deserialization without validation; variable obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, managing a TTL-based set with persistence. The primary security concern is the use of pickle, which can execute arbitrary code if the pickle files are maliciously crafted. Obfuscated variable names suggest an attempt to hide behavior but do not indicate malicious intent. No active malicious code or network activity is present. The reliance on pickle without validation or integrity checks is a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but poses a high security risk due to unsafe pickle deserialization. Obfuscation is superficial and not indicative of malicious intent. Proper validation, use of safer serialization methods, or integrity verification is recommended to mitigate this risk.",
