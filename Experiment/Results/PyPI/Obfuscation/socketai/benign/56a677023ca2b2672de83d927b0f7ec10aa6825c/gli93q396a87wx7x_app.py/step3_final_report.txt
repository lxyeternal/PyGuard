{
  "purpose": "Monitor an IMAP account for DMARC aggregate reports and provide a Prometheus endpoint for metrics derived from incoming reports.",
  "sources": "IMAP email data, report metadata, email report content, environment variables, configuration files",
  "sinks": "Metrics database, report storage, logging outputs, network connections for email fetching and reporting",
  "flows": "Email report data is read from IMAP, processed through report parsing functions, stored in databases, and metrics are exported via Prometheus; report metadata is deduplicated and stored",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive variable, class, and module names; dynamic import patterns; obscure import strings; minimal comments; variable names do not reflect their purpose",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard DMARC report collection via IMAP, processes email reports, deduplicates reports, and exposes metrics. Obfuscation is significant but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity is present. The low malware score (0.1) aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score (around 0.7) reflects the obscured naming. The overall security risk score (0.2) is justified given the functionality and lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate DMARC report collector with heavy obfuscation. No malicious activity or sabotage is evident. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review, but scores are consistent with the observed behavior. No modifications to the scores are necessary.",
