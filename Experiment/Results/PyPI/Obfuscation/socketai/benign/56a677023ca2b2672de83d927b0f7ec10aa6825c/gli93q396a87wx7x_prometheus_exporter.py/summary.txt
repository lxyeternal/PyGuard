  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate DMARC metrics exporter with high obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The suspicion stems mainly from naming obfuscation rather than functional malicious activity. The malware score should be set to 0, the obfuscation score is justified at around 0.8, and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.35), reflecting caution due to obfuscation but no active threats."
