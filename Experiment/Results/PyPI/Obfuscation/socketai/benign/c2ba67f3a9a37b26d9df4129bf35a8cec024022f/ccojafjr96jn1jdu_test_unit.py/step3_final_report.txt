{
  "purpose": "The code performs statistical analysis, normalization, and validation on numerical datasets, likely for scientific or bioinformatics purposes. It includes data generation, normalization, batch effect correction, and various validation assertions.",
  "sources": "Data is generated internally using numpy's random normal distributions and pandas DataFrames; no external data inputs or untrusted sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "Data remains within memory; no external communication, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from random data generation to normalization functions, then to validation assertions, all within in-memory structures without external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated function and variable names, cryptic import paths, and complex code structure. No clear external data sources or malicious payloads, but obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex, obfuscated data processing pipeline involving statistical validation, normalization, and batch correction routines. No signs of malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation appears stylistic or for IP protection rather than malicious intent. Assertions and validation steps indicate a focus on data integrity. The code's purpose aligns with scientific data analysis rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, scientific or validation-oriented data processing script with no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The obfuscation is notable but does not imply malicious intent based on the analysis. Overall, the security risk is low, and no malware is present.",
