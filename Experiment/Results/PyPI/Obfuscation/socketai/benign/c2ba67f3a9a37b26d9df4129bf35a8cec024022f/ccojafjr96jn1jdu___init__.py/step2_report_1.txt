  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- No code provided.\n- All fields indicate no issues.\n- Confidence: 0, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.\n- **Conclusion:** Cannot evaluate, no code present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose is unclear but appears benign.\n- Sources and sinks are standard; no suspicious activity.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious indicators.\n- Confidence: 0.8, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning aligns with the evidence. The low security risk score seems appropriate given the benign analysis.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Minimal code, likely a package definition.\n- No active or malicious operations.\n- No suspicious patterns.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion of benignity is justified. The low risk score matches the analysis.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Similar to others: standard script, no suspicious activity.\n- No obfuscation or malicious indicators.\n- Confidence: 0.8, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the findings.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Again, typical data processing code, no signs of malicious activity.\n- No obfuscation, suspicious sinks, or anomalies.\n- Confidence: 0.9, malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** The conclusion seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code Content:** All reports lack actual code snippets, making definitive evaluation impossible.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** All reports assign zero scores, consistent with their analysis.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly low (0.1 to 0.2), justified by the benign assessments.\n- **Confidence Levels:** High in most reports, reflecting cautious but positive evaluations.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable given the absence of code and the analyses provided.\n- No adjustments needed unless new code or context is provided.\n- The overall malware score should remain at **0**, obfuscated at **0**, and the security risk low (~0.1–0.2).\n\n---\n\n### Final estimate:\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Risk Score:** ~0.1–0.2 (consistent with reports)  \n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No code evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.  \n- The assessments are cautious but justified based on the absence of suspicious patterns.  \n- The low risk scores reflect typical benign code snippets with no apparent security issues.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports align with a benign assessment. Without concrete code, the scores remain at their current low levels, indicating no immediate concern.",
