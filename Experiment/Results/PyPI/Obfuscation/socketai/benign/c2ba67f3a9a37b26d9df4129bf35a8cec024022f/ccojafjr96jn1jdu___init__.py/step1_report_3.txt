{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the definition of a Python package, potentially with some utility functions or class definitions, but no explicit main logic or operational behavior is evident from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data primarily from imported modules and possibly from environment variables or input functions if present (not visible in the snippet). There are no clear user input sources in the given fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file system writes, or subprocess calls if present, but none are evident here. Without such code, no dangerous sinks are observed.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows from sources to sinks are observable in the provided snippet. The code mainly consists of definitions or initializations.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious function calls are present in the visible code. The structure appears typical for a package module.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and appears to define a package module without any active or malicious operations. There are no signs of suspicious data handling, environment variable misuse, or obfuscated constructs. No external connections or harmful operations are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and typical for a Python package module.",
