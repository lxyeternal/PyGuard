  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named iaPAtaNoiUmBJiTTLJfxABTvNHtTFCAR",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reads",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points",
  "flows": "No data flows; class definition without any data manipulation or processing",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure; no apparent functional purpose beyond defining an exception",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The class name is a long, seemingly random string, which may suggest obfuscation. The constructor accepts a message parameter and initializes the parent Exception class with this message. There are no external data sources, no use of environment variables, network calls, or other risky operations. The code is straightforward and structurally simple, with no signs of malicious activity or malicious code patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, which on its own does not indicate malicious behavior. There are no suspicious operations or malware indicators present. The obfuscated name could be a simple obfuscation or placeholder, but it does not introduce any security risks or malicious intent.",
