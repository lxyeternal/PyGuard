  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named iaPAtaNoiUmBJiTTLJfxABTvNHtTFCAR.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading; the code only defines a class.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process data or interact with external systems.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present, as the code only declares a class without any runtime execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a randomly generated string, which could indicate obfuscation or an attempt to conceal purpose. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception. The constructor takes a message parameter and passes it to the parent constructor. There are no external data sources, no data sinks, no network activity, or suspicious logic. The class name's randomness could be suspicious if seen in a broader context, but on its own, it is benign.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple custom exception class with an obfuscated-looking name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet. It appears to be benign code likely used for exception handling.",
