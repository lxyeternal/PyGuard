{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class for handling specific error cases with a message.",
  "sources": "The constructor of the class receives a message parameter, which is stored and passed to the base Exception class.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any untrusted data sinks or data leaks.",
  "flows": "Input message flows from the constructor parameter to the instance attribute and the Exception base class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a random or obfuscated string; no other unusual code features or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with a custom message attribute, which is standard for custom exceptions. There are no dynamic code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The class name looks suspiciously obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No input sanitization or external data handling is involved.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward custom exception class with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated class name may suggest code obfuscation but not necessarily malicious intent.",
