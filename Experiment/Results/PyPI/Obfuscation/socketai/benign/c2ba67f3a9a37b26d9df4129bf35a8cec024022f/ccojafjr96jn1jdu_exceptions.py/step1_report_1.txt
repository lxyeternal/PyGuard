  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named iaPAtaNoiUmBJiTTLJfxABTvNHtTFCAR.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; class definition only.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class is a simple exception subclass.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated; no meaningful identifiers. No external dependencies or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception. The constructor stores a message attribute and calls the superclass constructor with it. There are no input sources, no data processing, no external calls, or suspicious behaviors. The class name is unusual but not inherently malicious. Overall, this appears to be a straightforward class definition with obfuscated naming, possibly for concealment or obfuscation purposes, but no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated-looking custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual class name may suggest code obfuscation or concealment but does not indicate malicious intent.",
