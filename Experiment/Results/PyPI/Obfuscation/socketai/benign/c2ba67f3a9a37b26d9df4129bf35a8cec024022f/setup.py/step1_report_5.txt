  "purpose": "Set up a Python package for batch effects correction using empirical Bayes methods.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks detected; no output to external systems or network activities.",
  "flows": "Reads file content to assign to variable, then uses it in package setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a local README.md file, assigns its content to a variable, and then uses it as the long description in setuptools.setup(). The setup configuration appears standard for packaging Python modules, including dependencies, metadata, and classifiers. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. Variable names are unconventional but do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware or security risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues detected. The unconventional variable names are likely obfuscation or stylistic choices rather than malicious features.",
