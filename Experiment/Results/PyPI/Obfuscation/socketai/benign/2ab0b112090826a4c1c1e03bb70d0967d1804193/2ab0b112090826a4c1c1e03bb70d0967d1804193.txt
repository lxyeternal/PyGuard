      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with suspicious obfuscation via a non-standard attribute. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity, but the obfuscation warrants further investigation. The current scores are appropriate, and the overall security risk is low to moderate. Confirming the origin and purpose of the obfuscated attribute is advised."

The obfuscation and dynamic URL formatting warrant caution but do not constitute malicious intent. The current malware score of 0 and low security risk score are appropriate and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated Dash component class with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation is likely for proprietary reasons rather than malicious activity. Scores should be malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.8, confidence=0.9."

      "conclusion": "The code appears benign but uses an obfuscated symbol name, which warrants further inspection. No evidence of malware is present, and the overall security risk is low. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with high obfuscation and minimal risk, but caution should be maintained until the module contents are verified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated implementation of a graph data structure with traversal and serialization functions. No evidence suggests malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious activity. Scores are appropriately low, and the code can be considered safe."

      "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign in syntax but suspicious due to the obfuscated naming pattern. No direct malicious activity is evident. The scores assigned are appropriate; further investigation of the 'Tree' module is recommended to determine if it contains malicious code. Overall, the code poses low risk but warrants caution and additional review."

There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or data exfiltration. Obfuscation is minimal and likely stylistic or accidental rather than malicious. Overall security risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a test automation script with obfuscation techniques. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and use of a non-standard 'os' attribute introduce potential risk vectors. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic import, but no active malicious behavior is confirmed."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily for image serving and browser automation, with obfuscation and potential input validation issues. No malware or malicious payloads are detected. The main security concern is input sanitization to prevent directory traversal. Scores are appropriately low for malware, moderate for security risk, and reflect obfuscation."
