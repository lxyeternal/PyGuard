{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom Dash Cytoscape component with extensive properties, obfuscated variable names, and dynamic property assignment, likely for proprietary or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from dash.development.base_component, constructor parameters, kwargs, internal property lists.",
  "sinks": "Passes processed parameters into the parent class via **kwargs; no external system interactions or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Constructor parameters and kwargs flow into internal property dictionaries, then into the superclass constructor.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with meaningless variable and class names; dynamic property assignment via kwargs; no external network or file operations.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class definition for a Dash component, heavily obfuscated but structurally standard. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is evident. Obfuscation appears stylistic or proprietary, not malicious. The use of kwargs for property assignment is typical in Dash components. No signs of backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or vulnerabilities are present. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming obscurity, but the malware and security risk scores remain low due to the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated Dash component class with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation is likely for proprietary reasons rather than malicious activity. Scores should be malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.8, confidence=0.9.",
