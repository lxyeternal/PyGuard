  "purpose": "Define a custom Dash Cytoscape component class with configurable properties for visualization.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'dash.development.base_component'; class constructor parameters and kwargs; local variable assignments for properties.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data outputs observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization flows from kwargs and local variables into superclass constructor; no data flows indicating security issues.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated, which may suggest attempts to hide intent. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code evident. The code primarily defines properties and class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of a Dash Component, setting up various properties related to Cytoscape visualization. It uses obfuscated variable names, which could be a sign of attempts to conceal malicious intent or simply code obfuscation. There are no external data sources or untrusted inputs being processed in a suspicious manner. The constructor consolidates property attributes and passes them to the superclass. No network connections, file operations, or data leaks are present. Overall, the code appears to be standard component setup with obfuscated naming but no malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a class definition for a Dash Cytoscape component with obfuscated naming conventions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation might be intentional to hide complexity but does not imply malicious intent.",
