  "purpose": "Automated UI testing involving dynamic module import, server start, waiting for UI elements, and capturing screenshots.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to functions, module filenames, environment paths, and the current file's directory.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem for saving screenshots and images, driver method calls for UI interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence module import and filename construction; data flows from test parameters to filesystem operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; access to a non-standard attribute 'os.BBQvobXiHQiYVVCutBgvjvpzhvstxNJo' on the 'os' module, which could be malicious if environment is manipulated.",
  "analysis": "The code performs automated testing with dynamic module import, server startup, waiting for UI elements, and saving screenshots. The obfuscated variable names and the unusual attribute on 'os' suggest obfuscation or potential malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or destructive commands are evident. The suspicious attribute could be exploited if environment is compromised, but no direct malicious actions are present in the code. The obfuscation and dynamic import pose a risk but are common in testing scripts; their malicious potential depends on environment control.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a test automation script with obfuscation techniques. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and use of a non-standard 'os' attribute introduce potential risk vectors. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic import, but no active malicious behavior is confirmed.",
