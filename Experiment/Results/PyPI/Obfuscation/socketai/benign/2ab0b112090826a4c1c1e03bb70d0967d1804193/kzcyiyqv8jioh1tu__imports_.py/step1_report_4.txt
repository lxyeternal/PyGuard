{
  "purpose": "This code appears to export a class or function named 'Cytoscape' for external use, likely as part of a package's public API.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'PftcROOsWqzSzEiFDlVeBaIaGkJizrrf' from a local module '.Cytoscape'.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flow is explicitly shown, as the code only performs import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'PftcROOsWqzSzEiFDlVeBaIaGkJizrrf' appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated identifier, which may be suspicious. The rest of the code is straightforward but the import name raises suspicion of obfuscation or concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated or non-descriptive identifier from a local module, which could be an attempt to hide malicious code or obscure functionality. The '__all__' declaration exposes 'Cytoscape', but without additional context, it is unclear whether this is benign or malicious. The absence of actual code logic, data processing, or network interactions limits the scope of analysis. The suspicious aspect is primarily the obfuscated import name, which may suggest malicious intent or concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and not inherently malicious; however, the use of obfuscated import names raises concerns about potential concealment of malicious behavior. Without further context or code, this remains a low-confidence suspicion. The code could be benign packaging code, but the obfuscated name warrants further review.",
