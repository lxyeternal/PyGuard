  "security_risk": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign but uses an obfuscated symbol name, which warrants further inspection. No evidence of malware is present, and the overall security risk is low. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with high obfuscation and minimal risk, but caution should be maintained until the module contents are verified."
