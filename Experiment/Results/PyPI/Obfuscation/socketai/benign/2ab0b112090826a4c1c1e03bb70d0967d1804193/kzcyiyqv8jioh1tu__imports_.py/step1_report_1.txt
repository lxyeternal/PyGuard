{
  "purpose": "Exports the 'Cytoscape' symbol for external use, likely as part of a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Imports the 'PftcROOsWqzSzEiFDlVeBaIaGkJizrrf' symbol from a local module named 'Cytoscape'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication points present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated symbol from a local module, then exposes 'Cytoscape' for external use.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a highly obfuscated symbol name ('PftcROOsWqzSzEiFDlVeBaIaGkJizrrf') which could suggest hidden or malicious intent, though it could also be auto-generated or intentionally obscure. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific symbol with a non-descriptive name from a local module, then exposes a public API component named 'Cytoscape'. The obfuscated import name could be suspicious, as it may hide malicious code or intent, but it could also be an auto-generated or protected symbol. No other suspicious activity, network operations, or credential handling observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears minimal and benign in structure, but the obfuscated import name warrants caution. Without additional context or code, the overall risk seems low, though the obfuscated symbol could potentially hide malicious logic.",
