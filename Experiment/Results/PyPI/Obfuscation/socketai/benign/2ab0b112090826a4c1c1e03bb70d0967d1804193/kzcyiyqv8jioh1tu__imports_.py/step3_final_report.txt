{
  "purpose": "Import an obfuscated symbol from a local module and expose 'Cytoscape' in the public API.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .Cytoscape module, specifically the symbol 'PftcROOsWqzSzEiFDlVeBaIaGkJizrrf'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbol from local module; exposure of 'Cytoscape' via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated symbol name, which could indicate obfuscation or concealment; no explicit assignment of 'Cytoscape' to the imported symbol shown.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, syntactically correct, and does not perform any malicious actions. The main concern is the obfuscated symbol name, which could be auto-generated or intentionally concealed. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities is present. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but not definitive malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0 or very low, consistent with the lack of malicious activity. The risk score is low, but further review of the actual 'Cytoscape' module and the content of the imported symbol is recommended to confirm benignity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign but uses an obfuscated symbol name, which warrants further inspection. No evidence of malware is present, and the overall security risk is low. The scores are consistent with the analysis, with high obfuscation and minimal risk, but caution should be maintained until the module contents are verified.",
