{
  "purpose": "Export the Cytoscape class from the local module for external use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .Cytoscape imports a class or object named PftcROOsWqzSzEiFDlVeBaIaGkJizrrf from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "The code imports a class and then exposes a string reference to it via __all__, without any data flow involving untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object has an obfuscated name (PftcROOsWqzSzEiFDlVeBaIaGkJizrrf), which is unusual and could suggest obfuscation or concealment. No other suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an entity with an intentionally obscure name, which could be an attempt at obfuscation. The __all__ list exposes 'Cytoscape', but there is no indication in this snippet of how 'Cytoscape' is linked to the imported object, or if it is properly defined elsewhere. The structure is minimal, with no direct malicious code or data handling evident. The obfuscated import name warrants further review of the module contents, but on its own, this code appears to serve a straightforward purpose of exporting a class.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily serves to export a class from a local module, with obfuscated naming that could suggest concealment. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet, but the obfuscated import warrants caution and further inspection of the module contents.",
