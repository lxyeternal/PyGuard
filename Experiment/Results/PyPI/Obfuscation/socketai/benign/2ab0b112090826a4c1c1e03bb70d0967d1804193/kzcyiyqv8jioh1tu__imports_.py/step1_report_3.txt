  "purpose": "Exports the 'Cytoscape' identifier for external use, and imports a specific class from a relative module.",
  "sources": "Import statement: from .Cytoscape import PftcROOsWqzSzEiFDlVeBaIaGkJizrrf",
  "sinks": "Potential usage of imported class 'PftcROOsWqzSzEiFDlVeBaIaGkJizrrf' if instantiated elsewhere",
  "flows": "Import of the class from local module, then exporting 'Cytoscape' for external modules",
  "anomalies": "The imported class name 'PftcROOsWqzSzEiFDlVeBaIaGkJizrrf' appears as a randomly generated or obfuscated name, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, though this alone is not conclusive.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class with a suspiciously obfuscated name from a local module, then declares '__all__' with 'Cytoscape' for external use. There are no other code elements, logic, or data handling present. The use of an obfuscated class name could be benign, e.g., generated code, or malicious if intended to hide malicious behavior. However, no malicious actions or suspicious behaviors are directly observable in this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "This code is minimal and primarily concerned with module exports and imports. The obfuscated class name warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent based solely on this snippet. No clear malicious behavior is identified.",
