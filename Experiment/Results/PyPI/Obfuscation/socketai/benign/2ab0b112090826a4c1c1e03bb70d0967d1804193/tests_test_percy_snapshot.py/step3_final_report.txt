  "purpose": "Web interface serving images from 'screenshots' directory based on URL paths, with utility functions for image encoding and browser automation.",
  "sources": "URL pathname, filesystem directory listing, image files in 'screenshots' directory",
  "sinks": "Base64-encoded images embedded in HTML, filesystem reads, Selenium driver interactions",
  "flows": "URL path used to generate image src via encode function; directory listing for automation; URL segments used as filenames for image loading",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic URL-based path handling without explicit input sanitization, potential directory traversal risk",
  "analysis": "The code creates a web app that dynamically serves images based on URL paths, with obfuscated variable names and no explicit input validation. It reads image files from the filesystem and encodes them for display. The use of URL segments directly in file paths without sanitization introduces potential directory traversal vulnerabilities. No malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation and dynamic path handling could be exploited if inputs are manipulated maliciously, but no active malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for image serving and browser automation, with obfuscation and potential input validation issues. No malware or malicious payloads are detected. The main security concern is input sanitization to prevent directory traversal. Scores are appropriately low for malware, moderate for security risk, and reflect obfuscation.",
