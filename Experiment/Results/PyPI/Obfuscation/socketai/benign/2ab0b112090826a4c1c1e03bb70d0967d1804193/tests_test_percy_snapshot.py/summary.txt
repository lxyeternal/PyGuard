  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for image serving and browser automation, with obfuscation and potential input validation issues. No malware or malicious payloads are detected. The main security concern is input sanitization to prevent directory traversal. Scores are appropriately low for malware, moderate for security risk, and reflect obfuscation."
