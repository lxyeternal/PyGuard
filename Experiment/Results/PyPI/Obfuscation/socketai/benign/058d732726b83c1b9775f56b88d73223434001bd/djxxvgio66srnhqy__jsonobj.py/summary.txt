  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, dynamic JSON utility that does not currently exhibit active malicious behavior but possesses features that could be exploited if misused. The obfuscation and flexible data handling warrant cautious review, especially in supply chain contexts. The malware score is estimated at 0.3, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.5, reflecting moderate concern primarily due to potential misuse rather than active malicious payloads."
