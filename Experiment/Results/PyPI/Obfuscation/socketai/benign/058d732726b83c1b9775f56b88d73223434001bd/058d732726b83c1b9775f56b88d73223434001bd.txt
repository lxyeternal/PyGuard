The obfuscation and flexible data handling warrant cautious review, especially in supply chain contexts. The malware score is estimated at 0.3, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.5, reflecting moderate concern primarily due to potential misuse rather than active malicious payloads."

While obfuscation and dynamic imports warrant caution, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attack. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains at zero."

Other code snippets appear benign with no suspicious features. The assessment aligns with the observed behaviors, and scores are consistent with the analysis."
