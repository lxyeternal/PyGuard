  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package, primarily used to define package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for checking Python version, import statements for modules sys, setuptools, and warnings",
  "sinks": "warn function for displaying version-related message",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> warn (conditional check), import modules -> warn (if condition met), setup() (package installation process)",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard version check to warn users if their Python version is below 3.6.0. It imports necessary modules, issues a warning if the Python version is insufficient, and calls setup() with specified dependencies. All operations are typical for a setup script. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious data flows.",
  "conclusion": "This script is a conventional package setup script with no malicious intent or security concerns. It simply enforces a minimum Python version and specifies dependencies.",
