{
  "purpose": "The code is used to set up a Python package, specifically checking the Python version and configuring package requirements.",
  "sources": "The code reads the system's Python version info via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a version check and setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior are present; the version warning is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The script imports necessary modules and checks if the Python interpreter version is below 3.6.0. If so, it issues a warning. It then calls the setup function with specific package requirements. All actions are typical for package setup scripts and do not exhibit malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code does not include any suspicious data handling or potentially malicious code segments.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for a Python package, performing a version check and configuration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
