  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same or very similar code: a standard setup script that checks Python version and calls `setup()`.\n- No report indicates any suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behavior.\n- The code is straightforward, with clear logic: import modules, check Python version, issue a warning if too low, then proceed with setup.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, network activity, or data leaks are observed.\n- The purpose of the code aligns with common practices in Python package setup scripts.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- **Presence of issues?**  \n  **No.** All reports confirm that the code performs a simple version check and calls `setup()`. There are no malicious or suspicious elements.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- **Logical or coding errors?**  \n  **None.** The code is correct and standard for its purpose.\n\n### Score review:\n- **Malware score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. Given the absence of malicious behavior, this is appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code is clear and not obfuscated.\n- **Security risk score:**  \n  All reports assign `0`. The code performs a benign version check and setup, with no security risks.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- The **risk score** is 0 because there's no evidence of malicious activity, security vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior.\n- The **malware score** is 0, consistent with the absence of malicious intent.\n- The **obfuscated score** is 0, as the code is straightforward and readable.\n\n### Critical analysis:\n- **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the code as standard and benign.\n- **Any inconsistencies?**  \n  No. All scores and conclusions are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Based on the code and reports, I agree with the assigned scores.**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThe code is a typical setup script with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe code is a standard, benign setup script performing a Python version check and calling `setup()`. No malicious, obfuscated, or security-risk elements are present. The reports' assessments are accurate and consistent.",
