  "purpose": "Setup configuration script for a Python package, primarily used to specify package requirements and perform version checks.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info (reads Python version info), 'setup' and 'warn' functions (imported modules), static strings (warning message).",
  "sinks": "warn function (outputs warning message), setup function (initializes package setup).",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> warn (if version is too low), static check during execution -> warning message output.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code structures, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple Python version check and issues a warning if the environment does not meet the minimum requirement. It then calls setup to define package requirements. No user input is read, no untrusted data flows, and no malicious logic is present. The code appears to be standard package setup code with no malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script for a Python package with a version check and warning. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malware indications are present.",
