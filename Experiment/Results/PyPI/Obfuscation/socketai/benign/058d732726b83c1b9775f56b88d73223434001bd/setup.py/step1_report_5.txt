  "purpose": "This code sets up package configuration requirements for a Python project, specifically ensuring compatibility and requirements for packaging.",
  "sources": "Reads Python version info from sys.version_info",
  "sinks": "Uses warn() to alert users if Python version is below 3.6.0",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> warn() (triggered if version check fails)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code. The warning message is standard and benign. No obfuscated code or unusual behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Python version and issues a warning if it is below 3.6.0, which is standard practice. It then proceeds to call setup() with specific requirements for packaging. All operations are typical and intended for package setup. There are no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or data leakage. Usage of setup() and warnings is normal in setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. It performs a version check and issues a warning if needed. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
