  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for package installation, issuing warnings if Python version is insufficient.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, sys, warnings.warn, setuptools.setup",
  "sinks": "warnings.warn (potentially alerting users), setuptools.setup (initializing package setup process)",
  "flows": "sys.version_info -> warnings.warn (if version too low), then setup()",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no unusual code patterns; simple version check and setup call.",
  "analysis": "The script begins by importing sys, setuptools, and warnings modules. It checks the Python interpreter version; if it's below 3.6.0, it issues a warning. Then, it calls setup() with specific arguments to require 'pbr'. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code flows. The code is standard for a Python package setup script, with straightforward logic and no malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup configuration script with a version check and no signs of malicious or suspicious activity. It only issues a warning if Python version is too old and proceeds with package setup. Overall, it appears safe.",
