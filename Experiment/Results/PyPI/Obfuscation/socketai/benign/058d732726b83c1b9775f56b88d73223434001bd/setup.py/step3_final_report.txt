  "purpose": "The code is a standard Python package setup script that performs a Python version check and calls setup() with specific requirements.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info for Python version check, import statements for sys, setuptools, and warnings modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, network activity, or data leaks; setup() invocation is benign.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info is checked, and if below 3.6.0, a warning is issued; then setup() is called.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward version check and calls setup() with specified requirements. It uses standard modules and functions, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The logic is clear, and the purpose aligns with common package setup scripts. No anomalies or security issues are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with no malicious or security-risk elements. All reports correctly identify its harmless nature. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is 0.",
