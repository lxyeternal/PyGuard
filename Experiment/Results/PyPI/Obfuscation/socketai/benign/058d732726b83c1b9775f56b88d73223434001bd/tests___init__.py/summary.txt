  "conclusion": "The code in the fifth dependency demonstrates clear malicious patterns, including dynamic code execution, secret handling, and network activity, warranting a high malware and risk score. Other code snippets appear benign with no suspicious features. The assessment aligns with the observed behaviors, and scores are consistent with the analysis."
