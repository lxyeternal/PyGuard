{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a simple data processing or utility function, but without specific context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; possible data inputs could come from environment variables, user input, or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or output functions, but none are explicitly shown in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows are not clearly identifiable without concrete source or sink points; code primarily performs variable assignments and function calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected. The code is straightforward and uses common Python syntax.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks any obvious malicious patterns such as code injection, network communications, or data exfiltration. It performs basic operations without external interactions. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or unusual behavior. The absence of external input/output or secret data handling suggests low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign and straightforward, with no evidence of sabotage or malware.",
