  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated unit test suite for JSON processing with no security threats detected. Obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the static data handling is safe. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is low."
