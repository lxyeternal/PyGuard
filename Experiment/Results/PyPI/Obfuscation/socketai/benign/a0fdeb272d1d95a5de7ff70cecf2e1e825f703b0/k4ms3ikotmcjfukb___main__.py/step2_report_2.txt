  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code and considering the potential risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Summary:**\n- Finds no malicious code or supply chain attack.\n- Notes obfuscated import names and some malformed help strings.\n- Assigns a malware score of 0, security risk 0.2.\n- Confidence: 0.8; Obfuscated: 0.4.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is primarily a CLI wrapper, delegating core logic to 'parsers' and 'rundoc'.\n- Obfuscation is present but appears to be an attempt at hiding or code hiding, not necessarily malicious.\n- No evidence of code injection, network activity, or malicious payloads.\n- The malformed help strings are likely bugs or formatting issues, not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Malware score: 0** is appropriate.  \n**Security risk: 0.2** seems reasonable given the obfuscation but no active malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Summary:**\n- Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on the delegation to 'rundoc' modules.\n- Highlights the obfuscated import 'jnpThkzgQeTGFLgEoIikDAttdERcJucY' which is unused.\n- Malware score: 0, but obfuscated score is higher (0.6).\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code mainly acts as a CLI front-end.\n- The obfuscated import is suspicious but not necessarily malicious.\n- No direct code execution or network activity.\n- The concern about delegation to external modules remains, but nothing concrete.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Malware score: 0** is justified.  \nObfuscation is noted but not evidence of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Summary:**\n- Notes heavy obfuscation, especially in import statements and variable names.\n- Assigns a malware score of 0.4, citing the potential for malicious hiding.\n- Highlights delegation to 'parsers' and 'rundoc', which could contain malicious code.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The obfuscation and delegation to external modules are suspicious.\n- Without inspecting 'rundoc' and 'parsers', we cannot rule out malicious behavior.\n- The code itself does not perform dangerous actions directly.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Malware score: 0.4** is reasonable, considering the obfuscation and delegation.  \n**Security risk: 0.6** reflects the potential for malicious code within dependencies.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Summary:**\n- Similar to others, with focus on obfuscation and external dependencies.\n- Malware score: 0.2, but obfuscated score is 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The code is a CLI wrapper with obfuscated names.\n- No direct malicious actions are evident.\n- The concern about external dependencies ('rundoc', 'parsers') remains.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Malware score: 0.2** is appropriate for the script itself.  \nObfuscation warrants caution, but no direct evidence.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Summary:**\n- Focuses on the external dependencies and obfuscation.\n- Assigns a malware score of 0.1, considering the code's safety.\n- Highlights the suspicious import but finds no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The script is a CLI front-end.\n- The obfuscated import and variable names are suspicious but not malicious.\n- External dependencies should be verified separately.\n\n**Verdict:**  \n**Malware score: 0.1** is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores** across reports range from 0 to 0.4, with the highest being 0.4 due to heavy obfuscation and delegation.\n- The **obfuscated import 'jnpThkzgQeTGFLgEoIikDAttdERcJucY'** is a common theme, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious intent.\n- The core code appears to be a CLI wrapper around 'rundoc' and 'parsers', which could contain malicious code if compromised, but the script itself is benign.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware score:**  \nGiven the consistent obfuscation, delegation to external modules, and lack of direct malicious actions, I would assign a **malware score of 0.2**. This reflects some suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \nHigh obfuscation is evident; I would keep this at **0.7**, as the code is heavily obfuscated but not necessarily malicious.\n\n**Security risk score:**  \nModerate due to obfuscation and reliance on external modules, so **0.4** seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Score Type        | Final Estimate |\n|-------------------|----------------|\n| Malware           | **0.2**        |\n| Obfuscated        | **0.7**        |\n| Security Risk     | **0.4**        |\n\n**Note:**  \nFurther investigation should include analyzing the 'rundoc' and 'parsers' modules for malicious behavior, especially considering the obfuscated import and variable names.",
