      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation, no evidence of malicious activity, and low security risk. The primary concern is the obfuscation and external dependency, which should be verified for trustworthiness. Scores are malware: 0, obfuscated: 0.6, security risk: 0.2."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious characteristics such as obfuscation, dynamic environment handling, and interactive code execution, which could be exploited maliciously. While no explicit malware routines are present, its design allows for potential misuse. It should be reviewed thoroughly before use, and caution is advised due to its high potential for malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility module for styling and exception handling. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious obfuscation. The obfuscated variable names are likely stylistic. The static, non-interactive nature indicates it poses no security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious sabotage. It is a content processing utility with potential security concerns related to handling untrusted input in import_string functions. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation is minimal (around 0.2), and security risk is moderate (around 0.4), primarily due to handling secrets and environment variables without validation."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation, dynamic execution, and system manipulation features that are characteristic of malicious or backdoored scripts. Given the capacity for arbitrary code execution, minimal validation, and obfuscated imports, it should be classified as highly malicious with a high security risk. The potential for malicious activity is significant, and the code warrants cautious handling, thorough review, or removal from sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a CLI interface for 'rundoc' with significant obfuscation and reliance on external modules. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity within this snippet. The main concern is the obfuscated import and variable names, which could hide malicious payloads if those external modules are compromised. Overall, the script appears benign but should be reviewed alongside the external dependencies, especially the 'rundoc' package and the obfuscated import, to confirm their integrity."
