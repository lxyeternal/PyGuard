{
  "purpose": "Define color codes, exception classes, and version information, possibly for a larger script or application.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string, author info, email, and format string; class attribute definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external I/O present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code primarily defines constants and classes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of color codes suggests UI formatting, no suspicious behavior; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up color formatting constants, custom exception classes, and author/version info with no evidence of malicious activity. The variables and class structures are typical for UI or logging purposes. There is no network activity, data leakage, or obfuscated/malicious code detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, mainly establishing constants and exception classes without malicious intent or security risks.",
