{
  "purpose": "The code defines some constants for terminal color codes, a formatted copyright string, and custom exception classes.",
  "sources": "String variables with metadata, class definitions for terminal styling, exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks for untrusted data or external interactions; no network, file I/O, or environment access.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely defines constants and classes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of stylized terminal color codes and custom exception classes; no suspicious dynamic code, obfuscated logic, or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a part of a larger application or library focused on styling terminal output and defining custom exceptions. All variables are either metadata or styling constants. No input/output operations, external communications, or potentially malicious constructs are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected. The code does not perform any data manipulation, external calls, or obfuscation techniques. The exception classes are simple subclasses of a custom exception, serving as a structural element rather than malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is benign, serving primarily for styling and exception handling within an application. There is no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior in this fragment.",
