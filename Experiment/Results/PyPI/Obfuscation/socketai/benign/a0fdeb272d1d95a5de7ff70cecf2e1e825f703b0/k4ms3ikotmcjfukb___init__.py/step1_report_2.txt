{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define constants for colored terminal output, custom exception classes, and some formatted metadata information, likely intended for a CLI application or script.",
  "sources": "Constants and metadata variables initialized at the top; class definitions for exceptions and colored text.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file I/O, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from input sources to sinks; code mainly sets up constants and exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which could be an attempt to hide intent. No apparent malicious code or suspicious logic present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes several string constants representing ANSI escape codes for terminal colors and styles. It also constructs a metadata string with formatted project information. Several exception classes are defined, inheriting from a base exception class. The class and variable names are intentionally obfuscated, possibly to hide their purpose or to evade detection. There are no functions performing I/O, network communication, data handling, or other security-sensitive operations. The code seems benign in isolation, serving as utility definitions or part of a larger application.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script fragment defining constants and exception classes with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
