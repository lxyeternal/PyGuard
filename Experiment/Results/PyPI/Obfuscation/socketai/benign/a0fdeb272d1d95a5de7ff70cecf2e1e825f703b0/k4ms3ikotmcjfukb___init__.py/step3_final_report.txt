  "purpose": "Define project metadata, terminal styling constants, and custom exception classes for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Static string variables, class definitions, and formatted strings; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling; no external data flows or network calls.",
  "flows": "Static data assignments; no dynamic data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that are nonsensical; no malicious code or suspicious logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static constants for version info, author contact, terminal color codes, and custom exception class definitions. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no functions, data processing, network activity, or external I/O. The code appears to be a utility or configuration module, likely part of a larger system. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are evident. The obfuscation of variable names is superficial and not malicious. The static nature and absence of data flows or external interactions confirm its benign character.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility module for styling and exception handling. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious obfuscation. The obfuscated variable names are likely stylistic. The static, non-interactive nature indicates it poses no security risk.",
