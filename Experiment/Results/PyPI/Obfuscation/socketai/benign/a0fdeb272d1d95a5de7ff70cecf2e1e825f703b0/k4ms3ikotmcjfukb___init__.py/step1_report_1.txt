{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define some metadata, color codes for terminal output, custom exception classes, and a string with formatting information, possibly for use in a larger application or script.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string variables, class definitions, and format strings; no external input sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; there are no functions or operations processing untrusted data or performing network, file, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks, as all data is hardcoded and there are no data processing or I/O operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains color codes and exception class definitions, which are typical in CLI applications. The use of formatted strings with fixed values is benign. No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines constants, color codes for terminal styling, and custom exception classes. The variables contain static, hardcoded values such as version info, author, contact, and copyright. The exception classes are subclasses of Exception with no additional behavior. There are no functions, data processing, network calls, or other operations that could pose security risks. No obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward, defining configuration and exception classes without any malicious or security-threatening behavior. It poses no security risk and appears to be part of a larger application for terminal output styling or exception handling.",
