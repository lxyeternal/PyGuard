{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define some constants, class-based color codes for terminal output, and custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading operations are present in this fragment.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or operations that process untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flow paths from sources to sinks; the code primarily defines static constants and classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains long, nonsensical variable names and formatted string that could be obfuscated, but these are not inherently malicious. The string formatting is static. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines constants for colored terminal output, custom exception classes, and a formatted string with metadata about an author or project. No user input, network operations, or data processing occurs. The variable naming appears obfuscated but is consistent with non-malicious obfuscation practices, possibly for aesthetic or organizational reasons. No signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious code are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign module defining constants and custom exceptions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
