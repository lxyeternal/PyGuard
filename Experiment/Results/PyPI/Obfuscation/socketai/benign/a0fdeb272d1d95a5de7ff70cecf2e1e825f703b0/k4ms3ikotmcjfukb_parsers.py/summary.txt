  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious sabotage. It is a content processing utility with potential security concerns related to handling untrusted input in import_string functions. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation is minimal (around 0.2), and security risk is moderate (around 0.4), primarily due to handling secrets and environment variables without validation."
