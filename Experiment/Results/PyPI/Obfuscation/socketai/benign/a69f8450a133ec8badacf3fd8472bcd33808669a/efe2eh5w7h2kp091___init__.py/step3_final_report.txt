  "purpose": "Version string parsing and class extension within a larger application framework.",
  "sources": "The regex pattern parsing version strings; import of an obfuscated class; class attribute assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The regex pattern processes version strings; the class extends WizApp and assigns imported class to an attribute; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; import of a class with an obfuscated name; no dynamic code execution or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code compiles a version regex, defines a subclass of WizApp, and assigns an imported obfuscated class to a class attribute. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious activities are evident. The obfuscation may be intentional for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. The regex is standard for version parsing. The import and class extension are benign in this context. Scores assigned in reports (malware 0, risk 0.2, obfuscated 0.4-0.5) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a utility for version validation with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. Obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent; further context would be necessary for definitive assessment.",
