      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code pattern of importing an obfuscated module and executing its main() function is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The obfuscation and immediate execution pattern are common in malicious payloads. While direct evidence of malicious activity is absent, the pattern warrants caution. The scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high suspicion, and further inspection of the imported module is strongly recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for semantic version management with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects naming complexity but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for use in version handling tasks."

The risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, and further analysis is recommended if integrated into larger systems."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated version management utility with no active malicious behavior. The primary concern is obfuscation and reliance on an external 'self.val', which could cause runtime errors if misused but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
