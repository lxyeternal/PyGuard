  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for semantic version management with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects naming complexity but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe and suitable for use in version handling tasks."
