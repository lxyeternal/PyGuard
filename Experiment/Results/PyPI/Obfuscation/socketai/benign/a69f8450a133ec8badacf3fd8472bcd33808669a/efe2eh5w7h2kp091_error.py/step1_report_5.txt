  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named bCAMNgBMFJKWHtWsFFxvYsCYnNqxwXVc.",
  "sources": "The class definition is the source; no input reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; this is only a class declaration.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists in this code.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is a long, nonsensical string which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, but it might also be an obfuscated or intentionally obscure name.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a class definition inheriting from Exception, with a non-descriptive, seemingly random class name. There are no functions, no data processing, no input/output operations, and no code that executes beyond the class declaration. The obfuscated class name could be suspicious but could also be a result of code obfuscation or auto-generation. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident from this minimal snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There is no malicious behavior, no data leaks, or security risks directly observable. The unusual class name may warrant further context, but based on this fragment alone, it appears benign.",
