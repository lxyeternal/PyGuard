  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name.",
  "sources": "Class declaration; no data input/output, no external interactions.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flow or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; class declaration without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class name; no methods or logic; potential concealment but no malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class inheriting from Exception with a nonsensical, obfuscated name. No data input, output, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent on its own. The code is benign, serving as a placeholder or exception class. Scores for malware are correctly zero; obfuscation scores are high due to the name; risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature. The confidence is high in benign assessment but acknowledges obfuscation concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated exception class with no malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the overall security risk remains minimal. No modifications are necessary based on this snippet.",
