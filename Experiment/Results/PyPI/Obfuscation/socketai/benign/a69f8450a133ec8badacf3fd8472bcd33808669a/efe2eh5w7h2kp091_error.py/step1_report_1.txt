  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition for handling specific error scenarios.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink pathways since the code is only a class definition.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unusually named custom exception class; no functional anomalies or suspicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Exception with a non-descriptive, randomly generated name. There are no other operations, data handling, or external interactions. The class itself does not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious code. The lack of data input, output, or execution flow indicates a benign intent. The naming pattern appears random but does not inherently suggest malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple custom exception class with a random name, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a placeholder or a part of a larger codebase, but on its own, it does not pose any security threat.",
