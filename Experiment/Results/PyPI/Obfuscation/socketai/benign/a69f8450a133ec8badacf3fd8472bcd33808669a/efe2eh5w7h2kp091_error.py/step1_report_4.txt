  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named bCAMNgBMFJKWHtWsFFxvYsCYnNqxwXVc.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only class definition present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or operations involving external data.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class declaration is isolated.",
  "anomalies": "Unusually long, random-looking class name, which could be suspicious but may also be obfuscation or code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a custom exception class with a non-descriptive, seemingly random name. There are no methods, no data processing, and no external interactions. The long, nonsensical class name could be an attempt at obfuscation or generated code, but with no other context, it is not inherently malicious. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless class definition with no signs of malicious intent. The unusual class name alone does not indicate malicious behavior, but it warrants caution if seen in larger, suspicious codebases.",
