  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named bCAMNgBMFJKWHtWsFFxvYsCYnNqxwXVc.",
  "sources": "Class definition does not read external input or data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class is not instantiated or used in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated string; no meaningful purpose or context provided. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal class inheriting from Exception, with an obfuscated class name. It does not perform any actions, read input, or write output. The purpose seems to be to define a custom exception, but the obfuscated name may be suspicious or maliciously intended to hide its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines a custom exception with an obfuscated name but contains no malicious logic or behavior. The obfuscated name could be for concealment, but in isolation, it poses no direct security risk or malicious activity.",
