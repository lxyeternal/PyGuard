{
  "purpose": "A version management class that parses and manipulates semantic version strings, supporting pre-release tags like alpha and beta.",
  "sources": "Regex parsing of version strings, internal attribute updates for version components",
  "sinks": "No external data input/output, network activity, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Parsing version string -> updating internal version components based on input -> returning new version object",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, potential logical bug in version increment logic (missing comparison operators), complex naming possibly indicating obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass extending a version class, with regex for semantic versioning and methods to modify version components. No external I/O, network activity, or malicious code detected. The complex naming and potential bug in increment logic are noted but do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a benign version utility with some obfuscation. The logical bug could affect version updates but is not security-related.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate version management utility with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and logical bug are minor concerns but do not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), and the overall security risk is low (~0.15).",
