{
  "purpose": "Define a version parsing and manipulation class for semantic versioning with support for alpha and beta tags.",
  "sources": "Import statements; class attributes and methods; regex pattern for version parsing.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks identified; no untrusted data handling or external network interactions.",
  "flows": "The class methods process version data internally; no external data flow or system interaction detected.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The code appears to manipulate version strings for version management.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass extending an imported class, with regex for version parsing and methods for incrementing version components. The logic appears to handle version increments for major, minor, patch, alpha, and beta tags. No indications of malicious intent, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoor functions. It is a version management utility with no suspicious or malicious code behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard version parsing and management class with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It solely manipulates version strings for internal use.",
