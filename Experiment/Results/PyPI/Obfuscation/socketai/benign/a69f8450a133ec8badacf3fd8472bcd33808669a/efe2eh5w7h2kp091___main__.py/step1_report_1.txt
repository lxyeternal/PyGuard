{
  "purpose": "The code imports a module and executes its main function, likely intended to run a specific process or task defined within the imported module.",
  "sources": "The module import statement from the current package: 'from . import WsSWxrmrzXZAIblrkjICUrUfVTOZGUJN'.",
  "sinks": "Calling the 'main()' function of the imported module, which could execute any code within that function.",
  "flows": "Import of module -> execution of WsSWxrmrzXZAIblrkjICUrUfVTOZGUJN.main()",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'WsSWxrmrzXZAIblrkjICUrUfVTOZGUJN' appears to be a randomly generated string, suggesting obfuscation or concealment. No other code or data handling is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports a module with an obfuscated name and calls its main function. There are no visible data sources, user inputs, or external data interactions. The lack of additional code or context makes it difficult to determine purpose, but the obfuscated module name raises suspicion. Without examining the module contents, it is unclear what actions are performed during main().",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet imports an obfuscated module and runs its main() function. The obfuscated naming raises concern about intentional concealment, and the code's purpose cannot be determined from this fragment alone. It warrants further review of the module's content to ensure no malicious behavior.",
