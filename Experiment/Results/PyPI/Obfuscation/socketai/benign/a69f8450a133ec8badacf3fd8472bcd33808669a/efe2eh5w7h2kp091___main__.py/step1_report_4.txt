{
  "purpose": "Import and execute the main() function from a module named WsSWxrmrzXZAIblrkjICUrUfVTOZGUJN.",
  "sources": "The module import statement 'from . import WsSWxrmrzXZAIblrkjICUrUfVTOZGUJN' reads the module from the same package; 'main()' is called immediately after import.",
  "sinks": "Calling the 'main()' function may execute code that could be a sink if it performs malicious actions such as network activity, system modifications, or data exfiltration.",
  "flows": "Import module -> call main() -> execute contained code; any untrusted or malicious code within 'main()' would be executed.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'WsSWxrmrzXZAIblrkjICUrUfVTOZGUJN' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious and could indicate malicious intent. No other code present.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a module with a seemingly random or obfuscated name and calls its main() function. The obfuscated name suggests an attempt to hide functionality. Without inspecting the content of the module, the code itself is minimal but potentially dangerous due to the obfuscation. This pattern is often used to conceal malicious behavior. The immediate execution of 'main()' after import is also suspicious, especially in the context of obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code's minimal structure and obfuscated module name strongly suggest malicious intent, likely designed to execute hidden malicious code when 'main()' runs. Due to the lack of transparency and the suspicious naming, this package should be treated as potentially malicious and avoided unless the module's contents are verified safe.",
