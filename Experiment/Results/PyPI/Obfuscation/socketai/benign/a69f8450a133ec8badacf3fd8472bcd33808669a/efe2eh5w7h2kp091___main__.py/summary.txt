  "conclusion": "The code pattern of importing an obfuscated module and executing its main() function is highly suspicious and potentially malicious. The obfuscation and immediate execution pattern are common in malicious payloads. While direct evidence of malicious activity is absent, the pattern warrants caution. The scores should be adjusted upward to reflect the high suspicion, and further inspection of the imported module is strongly recommended."
