  "sinks": "Calling WsSWxrmrzXZAIblrkjICUrUfVTOZGUJN.main() potentially executes code from the imported module",
  "flows": "Import of module -> execution of main() in that module",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'WsSWxrmrzXZAIblrkjICUrUfVTOZGUJN' appears obfuscated and randomly generated, which is suspicious and often associated with malicious or unintended code obfuscation. No other code or context is provided.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module with a seemingly random, obfuscated name and calls its main() function. This pattern is suspicious because it might hide malicious intent or backdoors. There is no additional logic, input handling, or verification present. The lack of context and the obfuscated module name raise concerns about hidden or malicious code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal but the use of an obfuscated module name and direct execution of its main() function suggests possible malicious intent or obfuscation. This warrants further investigation into the imported module itself. Overall, the code has high suspicion due to obfuscation and lack of transparency.",
