  "anomalies": "Module name 'WsSWxrmrzXZAIblrkjICUrUfVTOZGUJN' appears obfuscated, with no meaningful identifier. No explicit data input or output sources identified.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module with an obfuscated name, which may be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obscure functionality. The call to main() suggests execution of code within that module. There are no visible data inputs, external network calls, or other suspicious patterns directly in this snippet. However, the obfuscated module name raises suspicion about concealment or malicious intent, especially if the package is unknown or untrusted. Without inspecting the contents of the imported module, it is impossible to determine definitively if malicious behavior exists. The code is minimal, making it difficult to assess any data flow or potential attack vectors.",
  "conclusion": "The code's simplicity and the obfuscated module name raise concerns about potential malicious intent, as it may conceal malicious code. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no explicit malicious activity visible. Further inspection of the imported module is necessary to confirm safety.",
