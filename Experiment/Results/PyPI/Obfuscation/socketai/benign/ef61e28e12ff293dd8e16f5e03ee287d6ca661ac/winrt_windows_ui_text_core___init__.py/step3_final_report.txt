{
  "purpose": "Defines various enum classes related to Windows Runtime text and UI components, likely for internal or API use.",
  "sources": "Enum class definitions and constants; no external data input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, output, or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Static enum definitions with no data flow or untrusted data input.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and constant names with no documentation; appears autogenerated or intentionally obscure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum class definitions with nonsensical, obfuscated names. There is no active logic, data handling, network activity, or system modification. The obfuscation suggests either autogenerated code or attempts to conceal intent, but without any functional or malicious behavior present. The lack of data flow or external interactions indicates a very low security risk. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains low due to absence of malicious activity. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants cautious monitoring if part of a larger, unexplained codebase.",
  "conclusion": "Static, obfuscated enum definitions with no evidence of malicious behavior or active vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the overall security risk is minimal based on this fragment.",
