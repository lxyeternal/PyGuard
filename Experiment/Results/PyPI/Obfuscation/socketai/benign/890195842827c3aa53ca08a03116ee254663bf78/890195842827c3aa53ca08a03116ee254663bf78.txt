      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation for initializing an API client with proper secret handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The code aligns with best practices, and the reports' assessments are justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated implementation of a search retriever interfacing with an external API. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The obfuscation raises maintainability concerns but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, if obfuscated, wrapper around an external search API. No evidence of malicious activity or security risks is present. Obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious; further review of the utility function and purpose of obfuscation is recommended."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily import statements with obfuscated class names, which warrants caution but does not provide evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score and minimal security risk are appropriate given the limited context. Continued review of the imported modules is advised to rule out hidden malicious behavior."
