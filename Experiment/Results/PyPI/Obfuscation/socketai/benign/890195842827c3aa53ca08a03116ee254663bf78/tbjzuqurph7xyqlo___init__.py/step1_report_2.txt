{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing modules and defining exports for a larger package or module related to content highlighting, text options, and retriever tools.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'exa_py.api', 'langchain_exa.retrievers', and 'langchain_exa.tools'",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks where untrusted data flows directly into sensitive operations or external systems",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are present; the code only imports modules and sets an export list",
  "anomalies": "Imports from modules with obfuscated or non-descriptive names (e.g., 'OeIoSnyzNAuxsbmlvBPjcCcXrpDAnuTL', 'yFQbBxSAImUiMyXQRakCsSQLMWowwnDW') which could be suspicious; no other suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily composed of import statements and an export list. The imported modules from 'langchain_exa' have complex or obfuscated names, which might be an attempt to hide their purpose. However, no executable code, data handling, or external network operations are present. The absence of logic reduces the likelihood of malicious behavior, but the obfuscated import names warrant caution.",
  "conclusion": "This code is mainly setup for a larger module, with imports and export declarations. The obfuscated module names are unusual but not inherently malicious. No evidence of malware or security risks was found in this fragment.",
