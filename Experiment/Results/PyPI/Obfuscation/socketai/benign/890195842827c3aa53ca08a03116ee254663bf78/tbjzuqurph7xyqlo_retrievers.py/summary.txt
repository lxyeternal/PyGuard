  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated implementation of a search retriever interfacing with an external API. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling. The obfuscation raises maintainability concerns but does not suggest malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the code appears safe."
