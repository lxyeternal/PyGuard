  "purpose": "Initialize and configure an Exa client object with API key and optional base URL from provided values or environment variables.",
  "sources": "values dictionary (inputs), environment variable 'EXA_API_KEY'",
  "sinks": "assigning to values['client'], using values['exa_api_key'].get_secret_value()",
  "flows": "values['exa_api_key'] is derived from input or environment, then passed to Exa constructor via a dictionary",
  "anomalies": "Use of convert_to_secret_str to handle API key; no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious data flows or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves an API key from input or environment, converts it into a secret string, and sets up a client object. The process appears straightforward, using standard security practices for secret handling. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is evident. The code manages secrets securely and initializes a client with proper configuration. It does not contain obfuscation or unusual code constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code securely manages API key credentials and initializes a client object without any malicious or suspicious behavior. No security risks or malware signals detected.",
