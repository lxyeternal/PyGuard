  "purpose": "Securely retrieve API key from input or environment, convert it into a secret string, and initialize an Exa client with optional base URL.",
  "sources": "Input dictionary 'values' (keys: 'exa_api_key', 'exa_base_url'), environment variable 'EXA_API_KEY'",
  "sinks": "Exa client initialization with secret value, potential exposure if secrets are mishandled outside this code",
  "flows": "Retrieve API key -> convert to secret string -> extract secret value -> initialize Exa client with secret and optional base URL",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code securely retrieves an API key from input or environment, converts it into a secret string object, extracts the secret value, and initializes an Exa client with this secret and optional base URL. It follows best practices for secret handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity. The process is straightforward and standard for secure API client setup. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The code does not perform any network operations or data exfiltration, and the secret management appears appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, secure implementation for initializing an API client with proper secret handling. No malicious or suspicious behavior is detected. The security risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is zero. The code aligns with best practices, and the reports' assessments are justified.",
