  "purpose": "Import a potentially obfuscated or non-standard module from a local package.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'fWfpepyCIPILgeOLwoIqOkKarFwnUTmb' from a local module 'deprecated_field'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement itself does not show data flow; no execution or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'fWfpepyCIPILgeOLwoIqOkKarFwnUTmb' appears to be obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious. The module is imported from a relative package, possibly indicating local code, but the obfuscated name raises suspicion of concealment or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing a module with a highly obfuscated name from a local package. No further code, data handling, or logic is present. The obfuscated module name might be an attempt to hide malicious code or functionality, but without inspecting the actual module content, we cannot confirm malicious intent. The import itself is standard, but the suspicious naming warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet appears to import an obfuscated or intentionally concealed module. While the import statement alone is not malicious, the obfuscated name is suspicious and warrants further investigation of the imported module's content for potential malicious behavior or hidden functionality.",
