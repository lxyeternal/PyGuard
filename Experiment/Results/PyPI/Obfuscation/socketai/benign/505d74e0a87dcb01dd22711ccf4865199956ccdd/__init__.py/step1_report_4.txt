{
  "purpose": "Import a specific function or object from a local module named 'deprecated_field'",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module within the package",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import statement only, no data flow or execution logic present",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'fWfpepyCIPILgeOLwoIqOkKarFwnUTmb' appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be suspicious; however, this alone does not indicate malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement from a relative module. The imported symbol has a seemingly random or obfuscated name, which might suggest attempts to conceal purpose. No other code or data flows are present, limiting the ability to detect malicious behavior. The 'deprecated_field' module indicates use of an outdated or legacy component, which could be a risk if the module itself is compromised, but this cannot be determined from this fragment alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an obfuscated identifier. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscated name warrants caution. No security vulnerabilities or malware signals are evident within this snippet.",
