{
  "purpose": "To import an obfuscated attribute/module from a local module 'deprecated_field', potentially indicating outdated or suspicious code.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are used in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows within this snippet; it is a static import statement.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute/module name 'fWfpepyCIPILgeOLwoIqOkKarFwnUTmb' appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward relative import from a local module. The attribute name is obfuscated, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious intent. No code execution, network activity, or data handling occurs here. The use of a deprecated module suggests potential security concerns, but without further context, this is not definitive. The malware score remains low due to lack of evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated name warrants caution, and the security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and deprecated code usage. Overall, the snippet appears benign but suspicious in naming, requiring further review of the imported content.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign but the obfuscated attribute name and deprecated module usage warrant caution. There is no evidence of malicious activity in this isolated snippet. The scores are consistent with a high suspicion of obfuscation but low likelihood of malware. Further investigation into the contents of 'deprecated_field' and the purpose of the imported attribute is recommended.",
