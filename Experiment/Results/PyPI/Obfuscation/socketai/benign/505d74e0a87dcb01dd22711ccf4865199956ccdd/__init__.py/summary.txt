  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign but the obfuscated attribute name and deprecated module usage warrant caution. There is no evidence of malicious activity in this isolated snippet. The scores are consistent with a high suspicion of obfuscation but low likelihood of malware. Further investigation into the contents of 'deprecated_field' and the purpose of the imported attribute is recommended."
