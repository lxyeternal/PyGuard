{
  "purpose": "Import a specific symbol (fWfpepyCIPILgeOLwoIqOkKarFwnUTmb) from a local module named deprecated_field.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module within the package",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import statement loads symbol into namespace, no data flow beyond module import",
  "anomalies": "The symbol name 'fWfpepyCIPILgeOLwoIqOkKarFwnUTmb' appears randomly generated or obfuscated, which is suspicious; no other code present",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement from a relative module. The imported symbol has a highly unusual, obfuscated name. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. The import may be part of a larger codebase, but on its own, it doesn't exhibit malicious behavior. The obfuscated symbol name suggests potential hiding of malicious code or an attempt to evade detection, but without further context or code, this cannot be confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal, consisting of an import statement with an obfuscated symbol name. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent from this snippet alone, but the obfuscated symbol raises some suspicion. Additional context is needed for a definitive assessment.",
