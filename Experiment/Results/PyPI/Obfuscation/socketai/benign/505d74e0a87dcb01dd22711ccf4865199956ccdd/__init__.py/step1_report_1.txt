{
  "purpose": "Importing a potentially obfuscated or dynamically named module or attribute from a local package",
  "sources": "The import statement sourcing 'fWfpepyCIPILgeOLwoIqOkKarFwnUTmb' from '.deprecated_field'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data handling or external effects present in this line",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable; this is a static import statement",
  "anomalies": "The module/attribute name appears to be randomly generated or obfuscated, which can be suspicious; no context provided for the module's purpose",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard import from a relative module named 'deprecated_field'. The imported attribute or module has a seemingly random or obfuscated name, which could be intended to hide functionality or evade detection. No other code present to evaluate for malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious actions. Without additional context, this line alone does not demonstrate malicious intent but raises suspicion due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an obfuscated or randomly named attribute/module. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is apparent from this snippet alone, but the obfuscated name warrants further review of the surrounding code.",
