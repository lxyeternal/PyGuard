  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code or description.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network calls, file operations, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, file writing, system commands, environment variable access, data leakage points.",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks indicating potential data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious activity pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual data flows, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code; assessments are based on descriptions or absence of code. The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, security risk, confidence) are generally low or zero, reflecting the absence of evidence. Some reports assign slightly elevated scores despite no code being present, which is inconsistent with the evidence. Proper approach is to set malware, obfuscated, and risk scores to 0, with confidence also at 0, as no analysis can be performed without code. The reasoning across reports is cautious and appropriate, avoiding unwarranted suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "Given the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores should be uniformly set to zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, with confidence at zero. The reports are consistent and cautious, and no further action is necessary unless actual code is provided.",
