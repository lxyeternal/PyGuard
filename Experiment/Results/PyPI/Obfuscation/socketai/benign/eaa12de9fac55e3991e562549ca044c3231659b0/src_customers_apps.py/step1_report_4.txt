  "purpose": "Defines a Django application configuration class for the 'customers' app.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'customers.signals' within the method 'nOeOWyGpVqWCgRbwayHfQSyqjUeDTrRl'.",
  "sinks": "Importing 'customers.signals' which could trigger signal registration or execution of code during import.",
  "flows": "The import 'customers.signals' could execute code when the method is called, potentially leading to unintended code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name 'XeWdqlfeuIFXTgtHCitWbpSTkYXwJeHb' and method name 'nOeOWyGpVqWCgRbwayHfQSyqjUeDTrRl', both obfuscated; no standard Django naming conventions. The import is placed inside a method rather than at the module level, which is atypical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with an obfuscated class name and a method containing an import statement. The import of 'customers.signals' is not standard practice at runtime; normally, signal registration is done at module load time or during app ready. The obfuscation and placement of import suggest possible intent to hide behavior. However, the code itself is limited and does not show any malicious payload such as network activity or data manipulation. The import could be used to trigger signal registration, which is common in Django apps, but in this context, combined with obfuscation, it raises suspicion about potential concealed functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated with unusual naming conventions and delayed import placement. While it does not explicitly contain malicious code, the obfuscation and atypical structure could be a means to hide malicious behavior or backdoors. Without further context, the code should be reviewed carefully, but based solely on this fragment, the risk appears low to moderate with potential for concealment.",
