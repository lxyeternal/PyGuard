  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class and import signals module from the 'customers' app.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'import customers.signals' within the method 'nOeOWyGpVqWCgRbwayHfQSyqjUeDTrRl'.",
  "sinks": "Potential import of 'customers.signals' could be a sink if it executes malicious code upon import.",
  "flows": "When 'nOeOWyGpVqWCgRbwayHfQSyqjUeDTrRl' is called, it triggers import of 'customers.signals'.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and method names are obfuscated, consisting of random strings. The import is within a method rather than at module level, which is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Django AppConfig subclass with obfuscated class and method names, possibly to evade detection. The import of 'customers.signals' is wrapped inside a method, which delays or conditions its execution. There are no obvious hardcoded secrets, network activity, or suspicious logic. The import statement itself is typical in Django for connecting signals but placed inside a method may indicate conditional or delayed import, not necessarily malicious. The obfuscation of identifiers and unusual structure warrants suspicion but does not definitively indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated Django AppConfig with delayed import of signals. No malicious behavior, malware, or malicious payload is evident from this snippet. The obfuscation and import structure could be for legitimate reasons or to hide malicious activity, but based solely on this code, there is no clear malicious intent.",
