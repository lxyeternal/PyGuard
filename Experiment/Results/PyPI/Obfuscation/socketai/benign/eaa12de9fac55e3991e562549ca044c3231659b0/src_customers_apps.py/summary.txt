  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious behavior directly but employs obfuscation and delayed import patterns that could conceal malicious code. The current scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is low, obfuscation is high, and security risk is moderate. Further inspection of 'signals.py' is recommended to confirm benign intent."
