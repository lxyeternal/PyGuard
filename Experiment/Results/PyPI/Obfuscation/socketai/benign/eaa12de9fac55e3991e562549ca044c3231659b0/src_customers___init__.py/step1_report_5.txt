  "purpose": "The code appears to be a basic utility script that performs a certain task, possibly involving data processing or network communication, but the specific purpose cannot be definitively determined without analyzing the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include user inputs via functions like input(), data read from files, environment variables, or network responses. Without the actual code, exact sources cannot be pinpointed.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks include network transmission functions (e.g., socket.send, requests.post), file writes, system commands, or eval() calls, which could lead to data exfiltration or code execution. Details depend on actual code lines.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, filesystem, eval). Specific source-to-sink paths cannot be detailed without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No specific anomalies can be identified without code content. Watch for hardcoded credentials, obfuscated segments, or unusual dynamic execution patterns in the code.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of the actual code snippet, a precise step-by-step analysis cannot be performed. The review must focus on typical risky patterns such as unvalidated input handling, insecure network operations, or hidden dynamic code execution, which require direct code inspection.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to conclusively determine malicious behavior or security risks. The code's intent and security posture depend on the actual implementation details, which are missing.",
