      "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious behavior directly but employs obfuscation and delayed import patterns that could conceal malicious code. The current scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is low, obfuscation is high, and security risk is moderate. Further inspection of 'signals.py' is recommended to confirm benign intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django multi-tenant model setup with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall security risk remains very low. The assigned malware score of 0 is appropriate."

      "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that the majority of the reports are benign or lack sufficient evidence of malicious activity. Report 1 warrants a slightly higher malware score due to signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution. The other reports are accurate in their assessments. The scores are consistent and justified, with minor adjustments recommended for Report 1 to reflect cautious suspicion."

The primary concern is the obfuscation and ensuring robust validation of the domain URL. No malware or malicious operations are evident. Scores are consistent with the analysis: malware 0, obfuscation ~0.8, risk ~0.3-0.4."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious mainly due to heavy obfuscation and dynamic schema name generation from untrusted inputs, which could be exploited for schema injection or similar attacks. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data theft, or backdoors. The overall security risk is moderate, and the malware score is low. Proper input validation and clearer coding practices would mitigate potential vulnerabilities."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django admin registration with obfuscated model and class names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is suspicious but not sufficient to classify as malicious. The overall security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible. Continued vigilance is advised if obfuscation patterns persist across the supply chain."

The scores should be uniformly set to zero for malware, obfuscated, and security risk, with confidence at zero. The reports are consistent and cautious, and no further action is necessary unless actual code is provided."
