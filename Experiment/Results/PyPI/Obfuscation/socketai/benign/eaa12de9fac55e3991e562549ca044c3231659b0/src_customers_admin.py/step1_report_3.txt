  "purpose": "Registering Django admin classes for models to customize admin interface display options.",
  "sources": "Importing models and using @admin.register decorators to register models.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leaks or malicious actions; primarily admin registration.",
  "flows": "Model import → Model registration via decorators → Admin class attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and variable names with no meaningful identifiers; no apparent purpose for such naming.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django admin and models, then registers two models with custom admin classes. The class attributes specify which model fields are displayed in the admin interface. All code appears to be standard Django admin registration with obfuscated class and variable names. There are no external data sources, network calls, or code execution components. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident. The obfuscation seems intended to conceal the purpose, which could be suspicious but may also be an attempt to evade detection or reduce readability.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard Django admin registrations with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident from the provided code snippet. The obfuscation is suspicious but does not directly indicate malicious intent based solely on this code.",
