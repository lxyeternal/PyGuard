  "purpose": "Django models for multi-tenant architecture with obfuscated class and variable names.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, UUIDField default, BooleanField, DateField, CharField, class inheritance from TenantMixin and DomainMixin.",
  "sinks": "No external input processing, network activity, or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Model fields initialized at class level; no external data flow or dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; one class attribute set at class level without context; a default string in a numeric field.",
  "analysis": "The code defines standard Django models for tenants and domains with highly obfuscated naming, which is superficial and likely for privacy or intellectual property reasons. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious code is present. The models use typical fields such as UUID, CharField, DateField, BooleanField, and inheritance from Django tenant mixins. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscation high, low security risk) are consistent with the code's benign nature. Minor anomalies like a string default in a numeric field are likely oversights but not security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django multi-tenant model setup with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but overall security risk remains very low. The assigned malware score of 0 is appropriate.",
