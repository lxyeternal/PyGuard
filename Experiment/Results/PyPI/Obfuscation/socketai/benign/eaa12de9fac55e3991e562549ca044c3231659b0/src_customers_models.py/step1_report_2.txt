  "purpose": "Define Django models for tenant and domain management in a multi-tenant application.",
  "sources": "Data inputs: UUIDField, CharField, DateField, BooleanField, PositiveSmallIntegerField",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow indicative of malicious activity",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable naming, presence of hardcoded default values as strings, no clear malicious intent or backdoors, use of UUIDs for primary keys which is standard",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django models: one for tenants and one for domains, with typical fields used in multi-tenant setups. The variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, but this does not inherently suggest malicious intent. No suspicious network operations, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be standard model definitions, albeit with unconventional naming. No hardcoded secrets or malicious logic detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django model definitions for a multi-tenant application without malicious or suspicious behavior. The unusual naming conventions seem to be obfuscation but do not indicate malicious activity.",
