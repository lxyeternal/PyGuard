{
  "purpose": "Defines Django models for tenant management and domain handling in a multi-tenant application.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.db and django_tenants.models, UUID generation, default values in model fields.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, no execution of external commands or network connections.",
  "flows": "Model definitions do not process untrusted data flows; mostly static data definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-like class names and variable names, but no malicious code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary Django modules and defines two models: one for tenant info and one for domain info. The tenant model includes a UUID field with a default generator, and several character, date, and boolean fields. No user input handling, no data processing, and no external communications are present. The naming conventions are obscure, but that alone isn't malicious. The code lacks any dynamic execution, external network activity, or credential handling. There are no suspicious functions or code constructs, only model field definitions and class inheritance.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django multi-tenant model setup with no malicious behavior or security risks detected. The obfuscated-looking names may be unusual but are not inherently malicious. No signs of malware, data leaks, or security issues are present.",
