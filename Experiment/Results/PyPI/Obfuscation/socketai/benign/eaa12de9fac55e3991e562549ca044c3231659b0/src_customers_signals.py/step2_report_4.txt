  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code handles post_save signals, transforms schema names, creates objects that generate database schema and host strings, with obfuscated names. It does not show explicit malicious activity but raises concerns due to obfuscation and dynamic database operations.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0.2  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.9  \n  - Risk: 0.4\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The code is highly obfuscated, which justifies a high obfuscation score.  \n- The malware score is low (0.2), consistent with no evident malicious activity.  \n- The risk score (0.4) reflects some concern about dynamic schema handling, especially if inputs are untrusted.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern: schema name generation, minimal validation, dynamic string construction, obfuscated code, potential for schema injection if inputs are malicious. No direct malicious activity.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8  \n  - Risk: 0.4\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware score is 0, which aligns with no evidence of malicious activity.  \n- Obfuscation is high, justified by code complexity.  \n- Risk score is moderate, given unvalidated input.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar logic: schema name processing, dynamic construction, obfuscated code, potential injection risk if inputs are malicious, but no explicit malicious actions.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.75  \n  - Risk: 0.4\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- The malware score is low, consistent with no active malicious behavior.  \n- Obfuscation is high, justified.  \n- Risk reflects potential schema injection.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores seem justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Obfuscated code, schema name generation, no malicious activity, internal utility pattern.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8  \n  - Risk: 0.2\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware score is low, no evidence of malware.  \n- Obfuscation is high, justified.  \n- Risk is low, consistent with no active threats.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern: schema name creation, obfuscation, no malicious activity, potential schema manipulation if inputs are untrusted.\n\n- **Scores:**  \n  - Malware: 0  \n  - Obfuscated: 0.8  \n  - Risk: 0.3\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- Malware score is low, no evidence of malware.  \n- Obfuscation is high, justified.  \n- Risk is moderate, considering unvalidated input.\n\n**Verdict:**  \nScores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports assign very low malware scores (0.2 or 0), which aligns with the absence of direct malicious actions like network activity, code injection, or data exfiltration. The obfuscation could be a concern, but not necessarily malicious.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** High across all reports, justified by the intentionally obscure variable and class names, complex string manipulations, and convoluted code structure.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Moderate (0.3-0.4), reflecting the potential for schema injection or misuse if inputs are malicious, especially given the lack of input validation.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** I agree with the current low scores; no evidence of malware exists.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** The high scores are justified, though perhaps slightly lowered to 0.8 from 0.9 in Report 1 for consistency.\n\n- **Risk score:** Slightly increase the risk in some reports to 0.5 if considering the potential for injection attacks, but current scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.1 — no active malicious behavior detected, just obfuscation and dynamic string handling.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.85 — code is highly obfuscated, intentionally complex.\n\n- **Security risk:** 0.45 — potential schema injection if inputs are untrusted, but no active malicious actions.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports' scores are generally reasonable and consistent with the code analysis. The primary concern is obfuscation and unvalidated input handling, which could lead to security issues if inputs are malicious. No evidence of malware or active malicious behavior is present.",
