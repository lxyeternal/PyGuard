  "purpose": "Extending the package search path for a namespace package using pkgutil",
  "sources": "__import__('pkgutil').extend_path(__path__, __name__)",
  "sinks": "None observed; no untrusted data processing or external outputs",
  "flows": "The code imports 'pkgutil', then calls 'extend_path' with '__path__' and '__name__' to modify the package's search path",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs; standard namespace package pattern",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and modifies the '__path__' variable for a namespace package. This is a common pattern in Python for namespace packages to extend the search path for submodules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or suspicious side effects. It does not process untrusted data nor performs network or file operations that could be malicious. The code appears to be a legitimate package initialization statement.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package extension pattern with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is used to extend the module search path in a safe manner.",
