  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages in Python, extending __path__ to include additional directories or distributions.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pkgutil' via __import__, usage of extend_path with __path__ and __name__.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing, external network calls, or data leaks; solely modifies __path__.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path(__path__, __name__) -> assign result to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "None; straightforward use of standard Python namespace package pattern.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a common, well-understood operation in Python packaging. It dynamically imports 'pkgutil' and extends __path__, which is a standard technique for namespace packages. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all correctly set to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The confidence score is high due to the clarity and standard usage. No vulnerabilities or anomalies are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package extension pattern with no security concerns or malicious intent. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores are appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
