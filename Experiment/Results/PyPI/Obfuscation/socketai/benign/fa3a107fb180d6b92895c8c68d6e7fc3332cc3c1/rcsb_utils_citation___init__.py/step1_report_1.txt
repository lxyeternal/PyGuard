{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define some string variables, possibly related to project metadata or package information.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments at the start of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flow points to external systems or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; variables are assigned but not used in further operations.",
  "anomalies": "All variables are hardcoded with static string values, which is typical for metadata but not suspicious on its own. No dynamic code, user input, or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward variable assignments containing static strings, likely representing package metadata such as license, author, email, and version. There are no functions, no external data inputs, no network communications, and no suspicious behavior observed. No signs of malicious code, data leakage, or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears benign, serving as metadata or configuration information. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this fragment.",
