{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata variables related to a software package, including license, author, contact, and version information.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read; all data is hardcoded as string assignments.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or processing of untrusted data; no external output, network connections, or sensitive operations observed.",
  "flows": "No flow of data from untrusted sources to sinks; variables are assigned static strings with no further processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as obfuscated code, unusual constructs, or suspicious variable names. The code is straightforward and static.",
  "analysis": "The code solely assigns hardcoded string values to variables representing metadata like license, author, email, license type, and security confidence score. No input reading, no external communication, and no dynamic or suspicious behavior detected. The content is typical for package metadata documentation or configuration, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains static metadata assignments without any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign and related to package information documentation.",
