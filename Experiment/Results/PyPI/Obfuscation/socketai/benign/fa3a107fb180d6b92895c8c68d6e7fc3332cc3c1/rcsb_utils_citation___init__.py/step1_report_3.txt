  "purpose": "The code appears to define metadata related to a software package, including license, author, contact email, and package description.",
  "sources": "The data is hardcoded within variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The variables are assigned static string values; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, obfuscation, or dynamic code execution observed. All variables are simple string assignments with no hidden operations.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of static string assignments representing package metadata such as description, author, email, license, and version. No functions, user input, network activity, or dynamic execution. It appears to be a standard package metadata declaration. No malicious behavior or security issues are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as metadata declarations for a Python package. No malicious intent, vulnerabilities, or suspicious activity detected.",
