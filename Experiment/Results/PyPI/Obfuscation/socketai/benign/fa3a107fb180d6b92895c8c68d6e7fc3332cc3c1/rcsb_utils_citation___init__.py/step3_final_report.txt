  "purpose": "Metadata assignment for package information including license, author, email, and version.",
  "sources": "Static string variables assigned at the module level.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignments only.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; static data assigned directly to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are nonsensical and obscure, but no malicious obfuscation or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments representing package metadata. There are no functions, dynamic code, input/output operations, or network activity. The variable names are nonsensical but do not indicate malicious obfuscation. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0, with minor adjustments for variable naming obfuscation. No anomalies or suspicious behavior are detected. The code is straightforward and typical for package setup or documentation purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign metadata with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a slight note that variable naming could be considered obfuscated but does not constitute malicious obfuscation. Overall, the code poses no security risk.",
