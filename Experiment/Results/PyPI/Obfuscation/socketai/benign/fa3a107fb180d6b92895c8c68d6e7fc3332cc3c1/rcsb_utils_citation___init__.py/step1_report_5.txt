  "purpose": "The code appears to define several variables containing metadata such as license, author, contact email, and license version for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments reading hardcoded string values within the source code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems or untrusted sources are evident in the code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "Variables contain hardcoded personal information and license details; no unusual code behavior or obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of straightforward variable assignments with string literals. No functions, external calls, or dynamic code execution are present. The variables seem to store package metadata, which is typical in setup scripts or documentation.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet. The code is benign and purely declarative, storing metadata information.",
