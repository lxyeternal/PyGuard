While not malicious, this behavior could be exploited if the package source is compromised. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable; malware remains at 0.1-0.2, and the risk is around 0.2-0.3, reflecting the potential for misuse but no actual malicious activity."

The low security risk scores are justified, and malware remains at 0. Future improvements could include URL validation to mitigate external source risks, but current analysis indicates no malicious behavior."
