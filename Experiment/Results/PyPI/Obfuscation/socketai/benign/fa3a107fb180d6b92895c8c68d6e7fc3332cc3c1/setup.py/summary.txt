  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with a potentially risky step of downloading external data during installation. While not malicious, this behavior could be exploited if the package source is compromised. The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable; malware remains at 0.1-0.2, and the risk is around 0.2-0.3, reflecting the potential for misuse but no actual malicious activity."
