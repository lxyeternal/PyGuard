  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, legitimate data retrieval and parsing routine for scientific data, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified, and malware remains at 0. Future improvements could include URL validation to mitigate external source risks, but current analysis indicates no malicious behavior."
