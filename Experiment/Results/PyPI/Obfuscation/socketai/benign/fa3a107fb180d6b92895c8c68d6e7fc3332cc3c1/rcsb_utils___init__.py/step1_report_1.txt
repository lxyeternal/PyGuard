{
  "purpose": "Extend the package's search path for module import resolution",
  "sources": "The import of 'pkgutil' and the use of '__import__' to access it",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data or external system interactions present",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; simply modifies __path__ using standard library functions",
  "anomalies": "Use of '__import__' instead of direct 'import' statement is unconventional but not suspicious; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports 'pkgutil' using '__import__' and extends the module's __path__ attribute with 'extend_path'. This pattern is a standard technique for namespace package support or complex package structures. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose related to package path management.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical pattern for managing package paths and does not exhibit malicious intent or security risks.",
