  "purpose": "Extend the package's search path for module loading",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to modify __path__",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs are present",
  "flows": "The code reads the module's __path__ and modifies it internally",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code behavior observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls 'extend_path' on __path__, which is typically used for namespace packages to extend their search path. This is a standard pattern in Python for supporting namespace packages and does not involve any malicious behavior or data leaks. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The code simply manipulates the module search path in a benign way.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for supporting namespace packages. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
