  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resources.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'pkgutil' and uses 'extend_path' to modify '__path__'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows or outputs are directed to external sources.",
  "flows": "The code modifies '__path__' by extending it with 'pkgutil.extend_path', but this is a safe operation and does not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual behavior detected. The code performs a standard package resource extension routine.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and calls 'extend_path' on '__path__' with '__name__'. This is a common pattern in namespace packages to extend the module search path across multiple directories or distributions. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or data leaks. The code is simple, straightforward, and adheres to standard Python package practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard package resource path extension with no malicious intent or security concerns.",
