  "purpose": "Extend package's search path for namespace package support using pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'pkgutil' via __import__ and use of extend_path to modify __path__.",
  "sinks": "Modification of __path__ attribute, which influences module search paths.",
  "flows": "Import 'pkgutil' -> call extend_path with __path__ and __name__ -> assign result back to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__ instead of a standard import statement; otherwise, no anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code employs a common pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python, dynamically importing 'pkgutil' and extending __path__ with extend_path. This pattern is well-documented and benign. No suspicious behavior, external communication, or malicious code is present. The use of __import__ is unconventional but not malicious. All signals indicate standard, safe package initialization.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern for namespace package support with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and no modifications are necessary.",
