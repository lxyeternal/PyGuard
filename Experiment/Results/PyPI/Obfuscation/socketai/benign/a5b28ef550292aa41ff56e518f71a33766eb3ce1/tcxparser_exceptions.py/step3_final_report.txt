  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated class names, one with a fixed message.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no external sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class definitions without runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names; no other unusual code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two custom exception classes with obfuscated names, one with a fixed message. There is no runtime logic, data handling, network activity, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation may be stylistic or an attempt to hide intent but does not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is 0, consistent with the benign nature. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.75), justified by nonsensical class names. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, only defining obfuscated exception classes with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0.75, security risk=0.1. No further action needed.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
