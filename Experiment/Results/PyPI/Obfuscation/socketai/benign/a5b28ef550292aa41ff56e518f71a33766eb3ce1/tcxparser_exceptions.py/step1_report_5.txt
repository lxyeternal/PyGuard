{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions, likely related to processing tcx files and heart rate data.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; only internal exception class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or output points present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or source-to-sink paths within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and contain seemingly random strings, which could be an attempt at code obfuscation. No actual code that performs data processing or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. One class inherits directly from Exception with no additional logic. The other sets a fixed message indicating a specific error condition related to missing heart rate data in a tcx file. There are no data inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors such as network calls, data leaks, or malicious payloads. The obfuscated class names could suggest an attempt at hiding intent, but based solely on these class definitions, no malicious activity is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of benign class definitions for custom exceptions, with obfuscated class names that may be a mild indicator of code hiding or simply arbitrary naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or data leakage in this snippet.",
