  "sinks": "No data sinks or data processing points; no untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are for exception handling only.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be suspicious, but could also be for obfuscation or stylistic reasons.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes with obscure, non-descriptive names. One class inherits from Exception with no additional behavior; the other initializes with a fixed message. There are no inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious code or malicious behavior. The obfuscated class names may suggest an attempt at hiding intent, but they do not perform any malicious actions. The code is minimal and does not contain any malicious or security-risk elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines custom exception classes with obscure names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The obfuscated class names are suspicious but not inherently malicious; they may be stylistic or part of a larger obfuscation strategy. Overall, this code appears benign.",
