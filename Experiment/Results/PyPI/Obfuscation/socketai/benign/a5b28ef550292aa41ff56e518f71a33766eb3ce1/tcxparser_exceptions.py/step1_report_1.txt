  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, one with a fixed error message.",
  "sources": "No input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, no data leakage or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; only exception class definitions without runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated with nonsensical, random strings. No meaningful logic or external data handling. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two custom exception classes, one with a generic pass and the other initializing with a specific message. Both classes are simple, standard exception definitions with obfuscated class names. No external data access, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt to hide intent, but on their own, they do not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely defining obfuscated exception classes without any malicious behavior or security risks. There is no evidence of malware or security threats within this snippet.",
