  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error cases related to data processing.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output points; only exception classes with messages.",
  "flows": "No data flows or processing logic; purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which could be an attempt to hide intent or confuse analysis. The second class sets a message about no heart rate data in a TCX file, but does not perform any operation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exceptions with obfuscated class names. The first class is an empty exception subclass, serving as a generic exception placeholder. The second class is a specific exception with a preset message about missing heart rate data in a TCX file. There is no input/output, data handling, or malicious logic. The obfuscation could be suspicious, but in isolation, these are just custom exception definitions. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code only introduces obfuscated custom exception classes without any operational or malicious code. There are no signs of malware, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation may be intended to hide the purpose but is not inherently malicious.",
