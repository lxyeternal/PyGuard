  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific error conditions related to heart rate data processing.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their initializations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flow from untrusted sources or towards sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data or control flow involving untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are nonsensical and obfuscated, which could indicate an attempt to hide intent or simply poor naming. No actual malicious code or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes inheriting from Exception. One class is empty; the other initializes a message indicating missing heart rate data in a TCX file. There are no imports, no dynamic code execution, no network activity, and no suspicious behavior. The obfuscated class names are unusual but not inherently malicious. No source-to-sink data flows or malicious behavior are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign, serving only to define exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no indication of malicious intent, malware, or security risks.",
