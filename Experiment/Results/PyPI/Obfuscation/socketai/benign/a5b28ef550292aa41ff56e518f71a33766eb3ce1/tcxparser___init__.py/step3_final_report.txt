  "purpose": "Import a specific attribute from a local module, potentially obfuscated.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .tcxparser importing bZtPCtIvydjSexYPPleMKIfLNXBwMuGo",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; no data flows or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only a static import without data flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated attribute name, which is unusual and suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing an attribute with an obfuscated name from a local module. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity on its own. The scores assigned across reports reflect high suspicion due to naming, but low malware likelihood given the lack of malicious code or behavior. The overall risk is moderate, primarily driven by obfuscation concerns. Further investigation into the 'tcxparser' module and the usage of this attribute is recommended to determine if it is benign or malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement's obfuscated attribute name is suspicious but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores are consistent with cautious suspicion. No evidence of malicious behavior is present in this snippet, but further review of the module and context is advised.",
