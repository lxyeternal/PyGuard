{
  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging, with obfuscated variable names and strings.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned obfuscated strings and parameters in setup(), such as author/license info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No external data flows, network activity, or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names and unconventional setup argument keys; presence of arbitrary strings like 'oenoqwm3p214yvpr' and irregular key names such as 'RUORrWHwrxleOxjklsxvyPLYGxwAaURP'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscation aimed at hiding details. No malicious code, network activity, or external data handling is present. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or proprietary reasons rather than malicious intent. The irregular parameter keys and nonsensical strings raise suspicion but do not demonstrate malicious actions. The dependencies are common and benign. Overall, the code's behavior is benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with high obfuscation but no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent. The overall security risk is low.",
