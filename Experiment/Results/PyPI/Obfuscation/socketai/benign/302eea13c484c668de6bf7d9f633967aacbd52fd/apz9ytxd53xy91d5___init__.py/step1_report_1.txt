  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility function, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input functions, environment variables, or imported modules. No specific input sources like network sockets or files are explicitly identified as untrusted.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, subprocess executions, or file writes, but none appear suspicious or directly untrusted in the provided code.",
  "flows": "The data flow involves reading input, processing it, and outputting results internally without passing untrusted data to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual behaviors are evident. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is inspected for common security issues: no hardcoded secrets, no unsafe eval or exec, no suspicious network activity, and no unusual obfuscation. Usage of libraries is standard, and no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code follows typical patterns and does not include suspicious logic or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not show signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no indications of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
