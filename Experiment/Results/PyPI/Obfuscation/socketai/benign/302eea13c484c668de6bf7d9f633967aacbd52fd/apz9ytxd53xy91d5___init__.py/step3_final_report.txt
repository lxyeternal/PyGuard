  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, data handling functions, input/output points, external library calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data serialization, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., user input, environment variables) to sinks (e.g., network, file system) via code logic.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign, straightforward code with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscation scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are high where code exists, slightly lower when code is minimal or absent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors identified. The scores are justified and aligned with the descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious or obfuscated elements. Security risk is minimal. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary.",
