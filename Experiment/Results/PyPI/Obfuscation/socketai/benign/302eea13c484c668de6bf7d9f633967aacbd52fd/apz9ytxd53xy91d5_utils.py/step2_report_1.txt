  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippets and descriptions provided.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports describe functions related to address matching, database setup, filtering, sorting, and comparison.\n- The content is primarily documentation and parameter descriptions, with no executable code or suspicious logic.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious system calls are evident.\n- The overall tone indicates standard geospatial data processing workflows.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** No malicious activity; code appears benign, focusing on filtering, sorting, configuration, and database operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (consistent)\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1 (low, given the potential for filesystem operations but no evident risk)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Score Justification:** The reasoning aligns with the content. No suspicious behavior detected.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Pure documentation with no executable code or malicious intent.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Score Justification:** Accurate; no signs of malware.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Descriptions of address matching and database management functions; standard operations.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher but still low; mainly due to potential filesystem operations)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Score Justification:** No malicious behavior; the risk score is reasonable.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Documentation for data processing routines; no suspicious activity.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Score Justification:** Consistent with benign content.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Utility functions for address matching and database handling; standard data processing.\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher but still low)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Score Justification:** No malicious activity; content appears legitimate.\n- **Recommendation:** Keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary:**\n- **Malware Scores:** All reports are at 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Very low, reflecting typical filesystem and database operations without evident security concerns.\n\n**My own assessment:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no signs of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk:** 0.1–0.2 (minimal, typical for filesystem/database operations)\n\n**Final note:** The reports are consistent with benign, standard geocoding and address matching workflows. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of recommendations:**\n- Maintain current scores.\n- No further action needed unless new evidence emerges.\n\n**End of review.**",
