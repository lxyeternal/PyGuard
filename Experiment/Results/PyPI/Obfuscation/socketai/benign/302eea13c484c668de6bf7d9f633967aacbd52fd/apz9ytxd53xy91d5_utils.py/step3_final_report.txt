{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for address matching, database setup, filtering, sorting, and similarity calculations within a geocoding context, primarily for address data processing and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include address strings, configuration files (.yml), database names, and file paths for databases and DuckDB files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve database operations, file system interactions (e.g., removing databases, downloading files), and network interactions (e.g., downloading from Hugging Face Hub).",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (addresses, configuration files, database names) through processing functions that perform matching, filtering, sorting, and database setup, potentially involving file I/O and network download steps.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious system calls are present. The code is primarily descriptive documentation and standard data processing routines.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are documentation and parameter descriptions for functions related to address matching, database setup, filtering, and similarity calculations. No executable or malicious code is included. The code operates on standard data inputs and performs typical geospatial data processing tasks. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system sabotage. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is appropriately set to 0. The obfuscated score is 0, as the code is transparent and well-documented. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9+).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, and the current scores are justified. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
