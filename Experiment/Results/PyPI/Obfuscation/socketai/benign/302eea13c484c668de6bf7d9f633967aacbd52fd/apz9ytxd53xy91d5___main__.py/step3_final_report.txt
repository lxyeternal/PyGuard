  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on supply chain threats such as code injection, data leakage, or malicious payloads.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, input functions, dynamic code execution (eval()/exec()), hardcoded strings or credentials.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamically generated code, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user input) leading to eval()/exec() or other dangerous functions, potentially resulting in malicious actions or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data, obfuscated code patterns, hardcoded credentials or paths, unusual import patterns, dynamic code generation.",
  "analysis": "The code review indicates that most snippets are benign, straightforward, with no suspicious patterns. The primary concern arises when eval()/exec() are used on untrusted inputs, which is a strong indicator of malicious intent. Other code appears standard, with no obfuscation or malicious payloads. The scores assigned in the reports align with these observations: high malware and obfuscation scores are justified for code employing dynamic execution on untrusted data, while benign code scores zero. The overall security risk is proportional to the presence of such risky patterns, with the highest risk in the report that uses eval()/exec(). Confidence levels are appropriate given the evidence. No false positives are identified, and the analysis is consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are justified based on the code behaviors described. The high malware and obfuscation scores correctly reflect the presence of dynamic code execution, while benign snippets are accurately scored low. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture indicates low risk for benign code and high risk where eval()/exec() are used insecurely.",
