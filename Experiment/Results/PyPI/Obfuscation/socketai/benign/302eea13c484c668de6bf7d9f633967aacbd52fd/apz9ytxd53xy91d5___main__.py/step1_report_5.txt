  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended to perform some data processing or computation. No explicit purpose can be determined definitively due to lack of comments or documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, standard input, or local files (if any), though none are explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes output to files, network sockets, or standard output; no suspicious or insecure operations are evident.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code seems straightforward without complex data flows.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code structures, such as obfuscated code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual language features, are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code was carefully reviewed for signs of malicious behavior, including malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The snippet appears to be a typical, benign Python script without evident security risks, suspicious network activity, or malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or anomalies are present. The overall structure is straightforward, and no complex or obfuscated code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign, functional Python script with no evident supply chain security issues.",
