  "conclusion": "The reports' scores are justified based on the code behaviors described. The high malware and obfuscation scores correctly reflect the presence of dynamic code execution, while benign snippets are accurately scored low. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture indicates low risk for benign code and high risk where eval()/exec() are used insecurely."
