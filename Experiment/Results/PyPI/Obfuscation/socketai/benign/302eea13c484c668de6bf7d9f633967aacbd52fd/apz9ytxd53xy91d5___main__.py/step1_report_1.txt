{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, possibly involving external libraries.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules; specific input sources are not explicitly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data transmissions—these are not explicitly visible but should be monitored if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through internal processing functions and potentially toward output or external communication points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code structure appears typical for a utility script or library.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, with standard import statements and straightforward functions. There are no signs of obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious patterns. No external network connections, data leaks, or malicious actions are detected within this fragment. Without further context or more complex logic, the code appears benign and consistent with normal library or utility functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward and does not contain suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious actions.",
