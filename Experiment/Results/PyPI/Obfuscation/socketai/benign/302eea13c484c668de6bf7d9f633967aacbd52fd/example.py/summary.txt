  "conclusion": "The code is a partial or test script for address geocoding, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (0.2) are appropriate. The code's issues are primarily related to incompleteness and poor organization rather than malicious activity."
