  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate geocoding management system with obfuscation that could be used to conceal malicious intent but currently shows no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is obfuscation and potential SQL injection vulnerabilities if inputs are untrusted. Malware score should be 0, with a moderate security risk due to possible injection issues."
