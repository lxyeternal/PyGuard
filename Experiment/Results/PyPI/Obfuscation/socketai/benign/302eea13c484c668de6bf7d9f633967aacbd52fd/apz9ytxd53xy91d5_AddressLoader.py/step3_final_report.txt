  "purpose": "A class for managing geocoding database operations, including data loading, index creation, spatial data structures, and database import/export functions.",
  "sources": "Functions that read data from input parameters, database tables, and external files during import/export and index creation.",
  "sinks": "SQL commands executing with string interpolation, database files written during export/import, and spatial data inserted into tables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters or external files into database tables, through SQL commands (potentially vulnerable if inputs are untrusted), and into spatial structures like KD-Trees.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and method names, use of string formatting in SQL commands without explicit sanitization, and placeholder-like SQL syntax. No hardcoded credentials or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard geocoding database management class with functions for data loading, index creation, and spatial data structures. Obfuscation is consistent across reports but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. The use of string interpolation in SQL commands without input validation poses a potential security risk (SQL injection) if inputs are untrusted. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware activity is not detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate geocoding management system with obfuscation that could be used to conceal malicious intent but currently shows no evidence of malicious activity. The primary concern is obfuscation and potential SQL injection vulnerabilities if inputs are untrusted. Malware score should be 0, with a moderate security risk due to possible injection issues.",
