  "purpose": "A class for geocoding and reverse geocoding using a DuckDB database connection, providing methods to geocode addresses and find nearby points.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from SQL queries and loads data via self.con.execute; reads data from self.reference_data; takes points as input for reverse geocoding.",
  "sinks": "Executes SQL commands with dynamic query strings; returns data from database queries and JSON loads.",
  "flows": "Input data is inserted into temporary tables, then SQL queries are executed (potentially dynamic), and results are processed into dictionaries or JSON.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamically formatted SQL queries with f-strings could lead to SQL injection if input is untrusted; no input validation shown. Variable names are obfuscated, which makes static analysis harder but not suspicious per se.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a geocoding class that interacts with a DuckDB database via an existing connection. It performs data insertions, SQL queries, and data transformations. The SQL commands are dynamically built using f-strings, which can be dangerous if user input is used directly, potentially leading to SQL injection. There are no hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. The obfuscated variable names obscure code intent but do not indicate malicious activity. The functions perform typical geocoding and reverse geocoding operations, with no network communications or system modifications. No malware signatures, such as data exfiltration or malicious command execution, are evident. Overall, the code appears to perform standard geocoding tasks with some risky SQL construction but no clear malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard geocoding and reverse geocoding functions with dynamic SQL query building that could pose injection risks if inputs are untrusted. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are present. The obfuscated variable names and use of dynamic SQL warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent.",
