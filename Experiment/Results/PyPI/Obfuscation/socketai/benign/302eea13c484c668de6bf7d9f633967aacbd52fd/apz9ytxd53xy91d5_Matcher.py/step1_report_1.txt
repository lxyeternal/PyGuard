  "purpose": "A class for geocoding and reverse geocoding using a DuckDB connection, with methods for geocoding addresses and finding nearest points.",
  "sources": "Input addresses inserted into the database, SQL query execution, data retrieval via database operations.",
  "sinks": "Execution of dynamic SQL queries, returning data fetched from database, loading JSON data.",
  "flows": "Input addresses -> stored in database -> SQL queries based on 'how' parameter -> data retrieved -> returned as list of dicts; Points -> database query -> JSON load -> return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamically constructed SQL query strings with f-strings (potential for SQL injection), no input sanitization shown, heavy obfuscation of variable names, use of loads() on database results without validation, dropping tables after operations.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to perform geocoding operations with a DuckDB backend. The dynamic SQL query construction with string interpolation (f-strings) in the geocode method indicates a potential injection risk if user input is passed unchecked. The obfuscated variable names make understanding difficult, which can hide malicious intent. Data is inserted into temporary tables and then queried; however, the code doesn't show any sanitization or parameterization, increasing risk. The reverse geocoding method loads JSON data from database results, but without validation, it could be exploited if malicious data is present. Overall, the code seems primarily focused on geocoding operations, but the use of dynamic SQL query building and obfuscated code, without explicit input validation, introduces security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs geocoding functions with potential security risks due to dynamic SQL string construction and obfuscated variable names. No direct evidence of malicious payloads or backdoors, but the SQL handling approach and lack of input sanitization pose security concerns. It warrants review and refactoring for safer parameterized queries.",
