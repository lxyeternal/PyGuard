{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to download dataset metadata, validate country names, fetch data from URLs, and extract ZIP files.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'dataset_metadata.json', reads country names from JSON data, fetches data from a URL, reads ZIP files from disk.",
  "sinks": "Requests response content written to disk, ZIP extraction output directory creation.",
  "flows": "JSON data parsed from file -> URL request -> response content written to disk -> ZIP file extracted to directory.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious URL handling or hidden backdoors. The code performs standard data download and extraction functions.",
  "analysis": "The script loads metadata from a JSON file, validates the provided country name against JSON keys, downloads data from a URL specified in the JSON, and extracts ZIP files. The use of requests for data download and zipfile for extraction are standard operations. There are no signs of malicious activities such as data exfiltration, command execution, or hardcoded secrets. The code does not process untrusted input beyond basic validation, and the data fetched is written directly to disk with no additional processing or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs typical data download and extraction tasks with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It adheres to expected patterns for such operations. No malware or malicious behavior detected.",
