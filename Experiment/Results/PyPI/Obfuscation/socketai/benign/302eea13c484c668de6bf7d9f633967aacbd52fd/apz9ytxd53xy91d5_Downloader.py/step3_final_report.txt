  "purpose": "This code loads metadata from a JSON file, validates country names, downloads data from a specified URL, saves it locally, and extracts ZIP files.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'dataset_metadata.json' and the URL specified within the JSON data.",
  "sinks": "Writes downloaded content to disk and extracts ZIP files to specified directories.",
  "flows": "JSON data is loaded and validated; URL from JSON is fetched via requests.get; content is saved to disk; ZIP files are extracted to a directory.",
  "anomalies": "Lacks validation and error handling for network requests and file operations; no obfuscation or suspicious variable names; no hardcoded credentials.",
  "analysis": "The code performs routine data download and extraction tasks using standard libraries. It validates the country name against JSON keys, fetches data from external URLs, and extracts ZIP files. No malicious code, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The primary concern is the absence of validation and error handling, which could be exploited if the external data sources are malicious. However, there is no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage within this module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs standard data handling operations. The malware score is 0, as there are no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clear code. The security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting the lack of validation/error handling but no malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe but could benefit from validation improvements.",
