{
  "purpose": "The code appears to manage dataset metadata, download data from a URL, and extract ZIP files, likely for data processing or analysis.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from a JSON metadata file and a URL specified within that JSON.",
  "sinks": "The code writes downloaded content to a file, extracts ZIP archives, and reads JSON files. It does not handle untrusted input directly beyond the URL fetch.",
  "flows": "Data is read from a JSON file (source), used to obtain a URL, which is fetched and saved to a file (sink). Then, ZIP file content is extracted to a specified directory.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No use of eval or dynamic code execution. The URL is fetched directly; however, the URL source is from a local JSON file, which is standard. No suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script loads metadata from a JSON file, which is used to validate a country name and retrieve a data URL. It then downloads data from the URL if accessible, saving it to disk, and provides functionality to extract ZIP files. The code operates with standard libraries and straightforward logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system modifications. The network request is made directly to a URL specified in local metadata, and the data is written to disk without processing or obfuscation. No suspicious code patterns or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard data download and extraction utility without malicious intent. It does not contain malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The implementation is straightforward, with no suspicious anomalies or obfuscation.",
