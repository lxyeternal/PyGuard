  "conclusion": "The code is benign and performs standard data handling operations. The malware score is 0, as there are no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscated score is 0, given the clear code. The security risk score is approximately 0.2–0.3, reflecting the lack of validation/error handling but no malicious activity. Overall, the code is safe but could benefit from validation improvements."
