{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to download and extract dataset metadata and data files based on country-specific information.",
  "sources": "The code reads the JSON metadata file ('dataset_metadata.json') and the data from URLs specified within that file.",
  "sinks": "The code writes downloaded content to files specified by 'output_path' and 'zip_path'.",
  "flows": "Source: Reading 'dataset_metadata.json' -> Accessing 'data_url' from JSON -> Downloading data via requests.get() -> Saving data to file -> Extracting ZIP file to directory.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses hardcoded filename 'dataset_metadata.json', but no suspicious or malicious activity is evident. No obfuscated or malicious code segments identified.",
  "analysis": "The code loads JSON metadata, verifies country name validity, fetches data from URLs, and extracts ZIP archives. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as network communication with suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The URL request is straightforward and limited to downloading data, with no evident attempts to send data elsewhere or execute malicious payloads. The code structure and variable naming are normal, with no obfuscation or malware-like behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard data download and extraction tasks with no signs of malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be a benign implementation for managing dataset files.",
