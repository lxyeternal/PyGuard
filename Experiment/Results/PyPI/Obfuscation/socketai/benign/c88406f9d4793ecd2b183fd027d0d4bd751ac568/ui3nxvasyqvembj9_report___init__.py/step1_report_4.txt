{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or network operation based on the functions and imports observed.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, user inputs, or network sources, depending on how data is received within the functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file writes, or system command executions that could leak data or perform unintended actions.",
  "flows": "Untrusted data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables, user inputs) to processing functions, which may then send data over the network or write to the filesystem.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are explicitly identified. No obfuscated code or uncommon language features are present. However, any dynamic execution or network transmission should be closely inspected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines functions that seem to handle data inputs and outputs. There are no signs of malicious code such as system calls, reverse shells, or data exfiltration routines. The structure appears typical for a data processing script. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activities are evident. The code does not contain obfuscation or unusual language constructs. Without further context, no malicious intent or security risks are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard data handling script without suspicious patterns.",
