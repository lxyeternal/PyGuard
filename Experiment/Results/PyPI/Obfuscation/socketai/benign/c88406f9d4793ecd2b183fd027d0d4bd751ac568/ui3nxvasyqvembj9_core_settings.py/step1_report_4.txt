  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for an image processing or automation project, including resolution strategies, version-dependent configurations, and environment variable usage.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PROJECT_ROOT' and 'IMAGE_MAXSIZE' accessed via os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used for configuration, not directly affecting system security or data flow.",
  "flows": "Environment variables flow into configuration parameters, influencing file paths and image sizes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables is standard, no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code detected. No obfuscated or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code sets configuration parameters, including version-based adjustments for CVSTRATEGY, and retrieves environment variables for project root and image size. No external data inputs, network connections, or suspicious logic are present. The code appears to be standard configuration setup without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward configuration class setting various parameters for an image processing or automation task. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected; it appears safe.",
