  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for an image processing or automation tool, including resolution strategies, logging, thresholds, and environment variable configurations.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PROJECT_ROOT' and 'IMAGE_MAXSIZE' via os.environ.get().",
  "sinks": "Environment variables influence 'PROJECT_ROOT' and 'IMAGE_MAXSIZE'. No direct data sinks or untrusted outputs are present.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read into configuration parameters; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive functions or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables is standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed. The code appears straightforward, with no obfuscated patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules for resolution and image processing, and defines a Settings class with various static and dynamic configuration options. It conditionally modifies 'CVSTRATEGY' based on the OpenCV version. Environment variables are used for project root and image size, which is typical for configurable applications. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is standard configuration setup with no malicious intent or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign configuration setup for an image processing or automation framework. It utilizes environment variables for configurable paths and image sizes, which is common practice. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
