{
  "purpose": "Defines configuration settings for an image processing or automation project, including strategies, thresholds, and environment-based parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PROJECT_ROOT' and 'IMAGE_MAXSIZE' used to obtain configuration values.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables used as configuration inputs; no data sinks or external data transmissions are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables flow into class attributes, influencing program behavior but not directly leading to data leaks or external actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables is standard; no suspicious hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily establishes static configuration parameters, adjusting some based on the cv2 version. It retrieves 'PROJECT_ROOT' and 'IMAGE_MAXSIZE' from environment variables, which is typical for configurable paths and size limits. No data is transmitted externally, nor are there any code injection or malicious operations present. The use of environment variables for configuration is common and not inherently malicious. No obfuscated or suspicious code structures are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward configuration setup with environment-based parameters. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident. It does not contain malware, obfuscation, or security risks beyond standard environment variable usage.",
