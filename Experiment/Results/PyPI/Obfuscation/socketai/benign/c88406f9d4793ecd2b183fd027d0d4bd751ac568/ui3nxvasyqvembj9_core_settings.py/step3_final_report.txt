  "purpose": "Configuration settings for image processing and automation, including environment variable inputs and version-dependent logic.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PROJECT_ROOT' and 'IMAGE_MAXSIZE' for configuration parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; environment variables are used for configuration only.",
  "flows": "Environment variables flow into configuration parameters; no untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected; straightforward static configuration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a static configuration class with environment variable reads, version-based logic, and fixed parameters. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. Environment variables are used as standard configuration inputs. The logic is simple and benign, with no obfuscation or malicious intent. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk~0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setup with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The environment variables are used safely, and the code does not perform any harmful actions. The assigned scores are appropriate and reflect the low security risk.",
