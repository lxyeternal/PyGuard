  "purpose": "Define configuration settings for an image processing or automation framework, including logging, image resolution strategies, and environment-based parameters.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'PROJECT_ROOT' and 'IMAGE_MAXSIZE'.",
  "sinks": "Environment variables read by os.environ.get.",
  "flows": "Environment variables -> Settings class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for configuration is typical; no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. No obfuscated code or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules related to image processing and resolution strategies. It defines a Settings class with various configuration parameters, some of which are set from environment variables. The use of environment variables 'PROJECT_ROOT' and 'IMAGE_MAXSIZE' is standard for configurable applications. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or malicious logic is present. The code appears to be straightforward configuration setup for an image-related project, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration class with no malicious intent. It safely reads environment variables for configuration purposes, and no suspicious or malicious activity is detected.",
