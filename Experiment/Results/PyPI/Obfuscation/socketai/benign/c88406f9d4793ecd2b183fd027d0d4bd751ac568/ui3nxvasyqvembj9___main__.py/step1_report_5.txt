{
  "purpose": "To invoke the main function from the airtest CLI module, likely for executing automated testing scripts.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'airtest.cli.__main__' and the execution of 'main()' in the __main__ block.",
  "sinks": "The 'main()' function is called, which could potentially execute code defined within the airtest CLI module.",
  "flows": "Import from 'airtest.cli.__main__' → call to 'main()' when script runs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code, minimal code, straightforward invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports only the 'main' function from the 'airtest.cli.__main__' module and executes it if the script is run directly. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or unusual patterns. The call to 'main()' depends entirely on the implementation of the imported function, which is a standard practice for CLI entry points. No data leaks, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident from this small snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a simple CLI entry point for running airtest automation scripts. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code snippet.",
