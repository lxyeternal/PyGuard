  "purpose": "Minimal CLI entry point that imports and executes the main function from airtest.cli.__main__.",
  "sources": "Import statement for main from airtest.cli.__main__.",
  "sinks": "Execution of main() which may perform actions depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "From import of main to execution in the if __name__ == '__main__' block.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward code with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard pattern for CLI scripts, importing main() and executing it if run directly. The security implications depend on the external airtest library's main() function, which is outside this code's scope. No malicious code, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities are present in this snippet. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, low security risk) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard CLI launcher pattern with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is very low, primarily dependent on the external library's behavior, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code is safe and does not warrant concern.",
