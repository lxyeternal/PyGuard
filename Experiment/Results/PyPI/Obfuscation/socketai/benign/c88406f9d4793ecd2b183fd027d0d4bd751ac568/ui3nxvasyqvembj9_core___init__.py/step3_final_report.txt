  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and data flow anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network sources, subprocess calls, standard input/output",
  "sinks": "Network transmission, subprocess execution, system commands, file operations",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network or subprocess functions, potentially leading to malicious actions if untrusted data is mishandled",
  "anomalies": "Potential obfuscation, use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs or credentials, minimal input validation, dynamic code execution patterns",
  "analysis": "The code sources data from environment variables, user input, or network sources, with some reports noting risky practices like eval/exec and obfuscated variables. Benign reports show straightforward code with no suspicious activity. Risky practices such as eval/exec and hardcoded paths increase security concerns, but no concrete malicious payloads are identified. Scores are generally aligned with the described behaviors, with some room for adjustment—particularly lowering the malware score in reports mentioning eval/exec without evidence of malicious payloads. The overall threat level remains low, but practices like dynamic code execution warrant cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no active malware or obfuscation. Slightly elevated risk scores in some reports reflect potential vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices. Adjustments suggest a malware score around 0.1, obfuscation at 0, and overall security risk approximately 0.3, indicating low but cautious concern.",
