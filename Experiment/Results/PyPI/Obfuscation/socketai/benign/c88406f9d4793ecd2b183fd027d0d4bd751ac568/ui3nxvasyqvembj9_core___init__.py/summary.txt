  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no active malware or obfuscation. Slightly elevated risk scores in some reports reflect potential vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices. Adjustments suggest a malware score around 0.1, obfuscation at 0, and overall security risk approximately 0.3, indicating low but cautious concern."
