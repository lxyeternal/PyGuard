{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of assertion functions for verifying conditions in automated testing or validation, particularly related to UI element presence and data comparisons.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from parameters passed to each assertion function, including variables, objects, or UI elements like 'v', 'first', 'second', and 'expr'. No external or untrusted data sources are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present that could lead to data leaks or system manipulation. The code primarily raises exceptions for failed assertions and logs wrapped functions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used within assertions to verify conditions; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The exception handling flows only trigger on specific conditions but do not process untrusted data beyond comparison and assertion.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses decorators like @logwrap, but there is no evidence of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hidden behaviors. No hardcoded secrets or unusual constructs are observed. The assertions are straightforward, and there are no suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The script defines various assertion functions for testing conditions, mainly for UI elements and data comparisons. It employs try-except blocks for handling specific exceptions related to UI element detection ('TargetNotFoundError'). The assertions raise AssertionError with descriptive messages upon failure. There is no evidence of malicious code, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The use of standard assertion patterns and exception handling suggests this is a typical testing utility module. No obfuscated code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of standard assertion utility functions for testing purposes. It does not contain malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. The code appears clean, straightforward, and safe for use in testing frameworks.",
