  "purpose": "Assertion utility functions for UI testing, verifying presence, absence, and equality of elements and expressions.",
  "sources": "Parameters passed to functions (e.g., v, first, second, expr), configuration settings (ST), imported modules (airtest.core.helper, airtest.core.cv, etc.).",
  "sinks": "No network, file, or system modifications; only raising AssertionError with messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into assertions; exceptions are raised based on conditions; no external data or untrusted sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of standard assertion functions decorated with 'logwrap', using 'loop_find' for UI element detection, and handling 'TargetNotFoundError'. The logic is straightforward, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. The use of 'loop_find' could be influenced if inputs are manipulated, but in the context of testing utilities, this is expected and not malicious. The code is clear, readable, and follows typical patterns for UI testing assertions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard set of assertion utilities for UI testing, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. Minor security risk scores in some reports are justified by the potential influence of input parameters but do not indicate malicious intent.",
