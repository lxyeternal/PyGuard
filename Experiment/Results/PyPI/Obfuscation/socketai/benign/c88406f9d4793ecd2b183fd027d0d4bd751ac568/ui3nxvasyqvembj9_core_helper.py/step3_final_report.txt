  "sources": "Path manipulations, dynamic imports, environment variables, and logging functions.",
  "sinks": "sys.path modifications, environment variable usage, and logging outputs.",
  "flows": "Path resolution functions feed into sys.path extension; import_device_cls and using functions load modules based on input paths; log functions output to logger and console.",
  "anomalies": "Use of inspect.stack() for script path detection, dynamic import functions modifying sys.path based on input paths, potential for untrusted input exploitation, but no malicious code or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code manages device registration, logging, and environment setup using standard Python patterns. Dynamic path and import handling are typical in plugin systems but could be exploited if inputs are malicious. No obfuscated or malicious code detected. The use of sys.path modifications and inspect.stack() are standard but should be used cautiously. Overall, the code appears benign and well-structured, with minimal security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for device and environment management within the Airtest framework. No malicious activity or obfuscation is present. The potential risks are typical for dynamic import and path handling but do not indicate malicious intent. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
