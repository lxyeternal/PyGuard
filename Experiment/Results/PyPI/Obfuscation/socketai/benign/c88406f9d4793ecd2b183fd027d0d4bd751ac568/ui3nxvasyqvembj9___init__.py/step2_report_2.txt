  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and verify the details:\n\n1. **Presence of issues in the code:**\n   - All reports describe a simple import statement:\n     ```python\n     from airtest.utils.version import __version__\n     ```\n   - This is a standard practice for accessing package version information.\n   - There are no signs of code execution, data processing, or untrusted input handling.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are reported or observed.\n\n2. **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:**\n   - The reports are consistent and accurate in describing the benign nature of the import statement.\n   - They correctly identify that the code only imports a variable, with no data sinks or flows.\n   - No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n3. **Scores assigned to each issue:**\n   - All reports assign:\n     - `confidence`: 1 (high confidence)\n     - `obfuscated`: 0\n     - `malware`: 0\n     - `securityRisk`: 0\n   - These are appropriate given the benign nature of the code.\n   - No changes needed here.\n\n4. **Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:**\n   - Since all scores are 0, and the code is harmless, no justification for higher risk scores is necessary.\n\n5. **Malware score considerations:**\n   - The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n   - No suspicious behavior, dynamic code execution, or obfuscation.\n   - Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n6. **Claims about vulnerabilities based on assumptions:**\n   - All reports correctly avoid making unwarranted assumptions.\n   - They recognize the code as a straightforward import with no security implications.\n\n7. **Consistency of scores with the report content:**\n   - Scores are consistent and appropriate across all reports.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is straightforward and not obfuscated.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risk present.\n\n**Final note:**\nThe reports are accurate and thorough. The code is a standard import statement for version retrieval, with no security concerns. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The code is benign.\n- The scores reflect the actual risk level accurately.\n- No malicious or obfuscated behavior is present.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0",
