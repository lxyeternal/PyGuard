  "purpose": "Importing the __version__ attribute from the airtest.utils.version module, likely for version tracking or compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Import statement that reads the __version__ attribute from a third-party library module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code only imports a variable.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported __version__ into the current namespace; no untrusted data handling or processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behavior observed. The import is straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string or variable from a known library, which is a common practice for package version tracking. There are no signs of malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscated behavior. The import statement alone is benign and typical for software modules.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign import statement used for version identification. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
