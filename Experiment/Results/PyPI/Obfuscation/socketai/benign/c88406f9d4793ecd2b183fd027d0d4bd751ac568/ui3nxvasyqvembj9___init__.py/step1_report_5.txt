  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is being output, transmitted, or used in a vulnerable manner",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs beyond the import statement; no source-to-sink flow",
  "anomalies": "The code is a straightforward import with no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious dynamic execution",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a version string from a specific module. There are no external inputs, outputs, or other operations. The code is minimal and typical for version checking. No malicious behavior or anomalies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. It appears to be a standard import statement for version information.",
