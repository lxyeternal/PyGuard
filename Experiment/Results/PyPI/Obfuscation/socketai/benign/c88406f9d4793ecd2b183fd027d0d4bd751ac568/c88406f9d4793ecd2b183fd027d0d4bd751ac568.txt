      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured report generator with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to file handling and plugin loading, which are common in such tools but should be used cautiously. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for legitimate use."

      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with no active malware or obfuscation. Slightly elevated risk scores in some reports reflect potential vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices. Adjustments suggest a malware score around 0.1, obfuscation at 0, and overall security risk approximately 0.3, indicating low but cautious concern."
