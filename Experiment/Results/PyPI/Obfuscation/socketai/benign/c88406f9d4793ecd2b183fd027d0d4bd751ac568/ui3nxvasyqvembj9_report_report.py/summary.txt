  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured report generator with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The low malware score (0) and obfuscation score (0) are justified. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to file handling and plugin loading, which are common in such tools but should be used cautiously. Overall, the code appears safe and intended for legitimate use."
