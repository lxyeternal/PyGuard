{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the security posture of the Python package based on provided code snippets and summaries, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from code snippets, configuration files, environment variables, network connections, and data handling routines.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file I/O operations, system calls, and environment variable accesses where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like network sockets, file writes, or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscation detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either absent or demonstrate standard data processing and I/O operations with no signs of malicious intent. Confidence scores are high where code is present, reflecting trust in benign behavior. Malware scores are zero across all reports, consistent with the lack of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (0.2), indicating minimal concern. The reasoning aligns with the descriptions, and no suspicious activity or obfuscation is evident.",
  "conclusion": "All reports accurately reflect the benign nature of the code, with appropriate scoring. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The overall security assessment remains low risk, and current scores are justified.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
