  "purpose": "This source code appears to perform data processing or utility functions, but without specific comments or context, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from environment variables, user input via functions like input(), and possibly from files or network requests if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing output to the console, writing to files, executing commands via os.system or subprocess, or network communications.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user input through processing functions to sinks like output functions or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hard-coded credentials or secrets. No use of eval, exec, or unsafe input handling detected. No obfuscated code or unusual language features observed. No suspicious network domains or cryptomining behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with typical input/output handling. No signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious system commands. Usage of standard libraries without suspicious patterns suggests benign behavior. Lack of context prevents a full security assessment, but based on visible code, there are no immediate threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no evidence of malicious activity. No security risks or malware indications are detected. Confidence is high that this is safe.",
