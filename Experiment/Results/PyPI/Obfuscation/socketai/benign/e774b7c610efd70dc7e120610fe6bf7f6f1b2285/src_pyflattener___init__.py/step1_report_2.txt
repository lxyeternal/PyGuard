  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform data processing or some form of computation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input variables, environment variables, or external files (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Data is potentially sent over network connections, written to files, or used in system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, file system, system calls) through intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or malicious code constructs are evident. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or misleading variables are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks. It does not include any suspicious network activity, system modifications, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms. Usage of third-party libraries is benign. No signs of malicious backdoors, code injection, or data leakage are present. The structure and formatting are typical of normal Python scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious Python script with no hidden threats.",
