  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on provided code snippets and analysis reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external inputs, potential dynamic code execution functions (eval(), exec()), hardcoded secrets, network activity, data flows from inputs to outputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network communications, dynamic code execution points, hardcoded secrets.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, external inputs) potentially leading to dangerous functions (eval(), exec()), network calls, or data exfiltration points.",
  "anomalies": "Mention of eval()/exec() suspicion without explicit code, potential hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, reflection, dynamic code execution, lack of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The reports uniformly indicate no concrete malicious activity or obfuscation based on available code snippets. Reports 1 and 2 show moderate to high confidence in benign behavior, with scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, aligning with their conclusions. Reports 3 and 4 lack code, correctly assigning zero scores. Report 5 discusses potential risky patterns like eval() or exec(), but without code, the suspicion remains hypothetical; thus, malware=0 is appropriate, but the cautious risk score of 0.2 is justified. Given the absence of explicit malicious functions or obfuscation, the scores are consistent and reasonable. Slight adjustments could be made if code snippets reveal actual dangerous functions, but based on current data, the scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The security risk is low but warrants monitoring if more code details emerge. The current scores are justified and align with the analysis, with a slight caution for reports mentioning potential risky functions without concrete evidence.",
