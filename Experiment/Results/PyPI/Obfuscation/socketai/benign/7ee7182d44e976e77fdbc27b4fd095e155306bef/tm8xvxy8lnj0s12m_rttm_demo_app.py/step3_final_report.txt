  "purpose": "Set up a GUI for audio annotation/analysis using obfuscated modules and variables.",
  "sources": "Filepath input, class instantiations, method calls on imported classes",
  "sinks": "Potential data upload/transmission via 'upload' method, external module functions",
  "flows": "Input data from user -> external module methods ('edit', 'upload') -> potential external data transmission",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and variable names, nonsensical class/function identifiers, lack of transparency",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules with suspiciously obfuscated names, then sets up a Gradio interface involving file upload, editing, and uploading. No explicit network calls or destructive actions are visible. The obfuscation suggests concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The external modules' internal behavior is unknown, which warrants caution. The code structure is syntactically correct but lacks transparency, raising suspicion. Scores assigned in reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscated ~0.8, risk ~0.4) are justified given the obfuscation and lack of evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, which raises suspicion but lacks direct evidence of malicious activity. Further inspection of external modules is necessary. The current scores are appropriate; the malware likelihood remains low, but obfuscation and potential concealment justify a moderate security risk. Continuous monitoring and vetting of external dependencies are recommended.",
