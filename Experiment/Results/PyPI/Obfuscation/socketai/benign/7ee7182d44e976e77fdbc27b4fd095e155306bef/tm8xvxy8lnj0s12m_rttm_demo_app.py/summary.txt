  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, which raises suspicion but lacks direct evidence of malicious activity. Further inspection of external modules is necessary. The current scores are appropriate; the malware likelihood remains low, but obfuscation and potential concealment justify a moderate security risk. Continuous monitoring and vetting of external dependencies are recommended."
