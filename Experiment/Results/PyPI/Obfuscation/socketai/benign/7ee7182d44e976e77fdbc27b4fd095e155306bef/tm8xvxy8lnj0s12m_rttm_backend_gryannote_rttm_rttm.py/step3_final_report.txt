  "purpose": "A Gradio component for handling RTTM annotation files, supporting file uploads, conversions, and annotation processing.",
  "sources": "Reads files via FileData, ListFiles, or URLs; accesses static sample URLs; creates temporary files for processing.",
  "sinks": "Writes RTTM files to temp files; loads RTTM data; processes annotation objects; returns file data or annotations.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (files, URLs, annotations) are processed through file reading, temporary file creation, and annotation conversion functions.",
  "anomalies": "Uses tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile with delete=False; constructs RTTM files with an undefined 'uri' variable; static URLs for sample files; no validation on file paths.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard file handling and annotation processing typical for such components. The use of delete=False in temp files is a minor concern but not malicious. The undefined 'uri' in one method is a bug that could cause runtime errors but does not indicate malicious intent. Static URLs are benign test files. No network activity, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code is clear, with no obfuscation. Overall, the component appears legitimate and safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, non-malicious implementation for handling speech annotation files within a Gradio interface. No signs of supply chain sabotage or malicious behavior are detected. Minor issues like the 'uri' bug and temp file handling should be addressed for robustness but do not impact security.",
