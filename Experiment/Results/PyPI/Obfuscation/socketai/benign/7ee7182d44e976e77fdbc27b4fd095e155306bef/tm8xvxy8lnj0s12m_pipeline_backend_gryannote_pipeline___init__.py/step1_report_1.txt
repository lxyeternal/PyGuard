  "purpose": "Export the 'PipelineSelector' class or function from the current module for external use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.pipelineselector' for 'SZgGXrVpIogPNcGRwRHxefvXgeXzjnUr'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink points; no data leak or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Import source (relative import) leads to the exported 'PipelineSelector', no further data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'SZgGXrVpIogPNcGRwRHxefvXgeXzjnUr' appears obfuscated or non-descriptive, which is suspicious; no other code activities or behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a potentially obfuscated or randomly named identifier from a relative module and defines an export list including 'PipelineSelector'. The import name's obfuscated appearance could be benign or malicious; however, with no additional code, context, or behaviors, it is difficult to determine intent. The minimal code structure and lack of other logic limit further analysis. No suspicious behaviors such as network access, credential handling, or data leaks are present. The only anomaly is the obscure import name, which could be an attempt to hide functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple module export statement with an obscure imported symbol. The obscurity alone does not imply malicious intent, but it warrants caution if the imported module or name is suspicious. No active malicious behavior or security issues are evident from this fragment.",
