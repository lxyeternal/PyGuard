{
  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated symbol from a local module and exposes 'PipelineSelector' via __all__, likely to hide or obscure functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .pipelineselector, reading the symbol 'SZgGXrVpIogPNcGRwRHxefvXgeXzjnUr'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbol (source) without further processing; no data flow beyond import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a nonsensical, obfuscated symbol name for import; mismatch between imported symbol and exported name in __all__.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, importing an obfuscated symbol and exposing 'PipelineSelector'. The obfuscated name suggests possible obfuscation or malicious intent, but no active malicious behavior such as network activity or data leaks is evident. The inconsistency between the imported symbol and the __all__ declaration raises suspicion. Scores across reports reflect high obfuscation (0.7), low malware likelihood (0.2), and moderate security risk (0.3), which are justified given the context. The code's structure alone does not confirm malicious activity, but obfuscation warrants further review of the 'pipelineselector' module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscated naming and inconsistency but does not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate; further investigation into the 'pipelineselector' module is recommended to determine if the obfuscated symbol is benign or malicious.",
