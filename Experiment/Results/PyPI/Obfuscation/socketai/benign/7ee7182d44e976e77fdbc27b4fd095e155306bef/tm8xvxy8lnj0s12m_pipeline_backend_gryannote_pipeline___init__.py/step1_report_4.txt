  "purpose": "Exporting the class or function 'SZgGXrVpIogPNcGRwRHxefvXgeXzjnUr' from a local module 'pipelineselector' for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module './pipelineselector'. No external input or data reading appears in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling functions present; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; code only imports and exports a symbol.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'SZgGXrVpIogPNcGRwRHxefvXgeXzjnUr' has an obfuscated or nonsensical name, which could be a sign of code obfuscation or malicious intent. The module name is generic and does not provide context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single symbol from a local module, and then sets __all__ to expose only 'PipelineSelector'. The imported name appears obfuscated, which is unusual and could be an attempt to hide functionality or hinder analysis. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or external communication. The obfuscated symbol name warrants further investigation, but on its own, this code snippet does not demonstrate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import and export operation, with an obfuscated symbol name that could suggest code hiding or obfuscation. There are no direct signs of malware or security risks in this snippet, but the obfuscated import warrants cautious review in the broader context.",
