  "purpose": "Import a specific class or function from a local module and expose it for external use.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "Import statement; no data flow from source to sink beyond module import.",
  "anomalies": "The imported class/function name 'SZgGXrVpIogPNcGRwRHxefvXgeXzjnUr' appears to be a randomly generated string, which is unusual and may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The code is minimal, with no additional logic or context.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single component with a name that looks like a random string, which is atypical and can be a sign of obfuscation or malicious intent. The __all__ declaration exposes only 'PipelineSelector', which suggests the module is designed to control its public API. There are no other suspicious behaviors such as data leaks, environment variable usage, or network connections. The overall structure is minimal but the naming pattern raises suspicion of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears minimal and straightforward but the use of a randomly generated import name is suspicious. This pattern can be used to hide malicious code or obfuscate intent. Given only this snippet, the likelihood of malicious behavior is moderate due to obfuscated naming, but no direct malicious actions are present in the code itself.",
