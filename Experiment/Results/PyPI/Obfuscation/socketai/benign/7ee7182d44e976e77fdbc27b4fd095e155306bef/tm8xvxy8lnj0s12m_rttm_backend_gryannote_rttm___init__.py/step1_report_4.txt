{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module exports and import a class or function from a local module named 'rttm'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .rttm, which reads the 'DSydgayWjEVUWgigxWBjHEXSKFcamich' entity from a local module.",
  "sinks": "The import itself is a source, but there are no sinks such as network communication, file writing, or data transmission present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The code only shows importing a specific symbol from a local module and defining __all__, with no data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'DSydgayWjEVUWgigxWBjHEXSKFcamich' has an obfuscated or nonsensical name, which could indicate attempts at hiding malicious intent or obfuscation. The code is minimal, with no comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a possibly obfuscated symbol from a local module and defines the public API with __all__. The obscured symbol name is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The structure is minimal, lacking any apparent malicious actions or external data flows. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code by itself is very simple and does not demonstrate malicious behavior. The obfuscated name of the imported entity warrants caution, but with the provided snippet, there is no clear evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
