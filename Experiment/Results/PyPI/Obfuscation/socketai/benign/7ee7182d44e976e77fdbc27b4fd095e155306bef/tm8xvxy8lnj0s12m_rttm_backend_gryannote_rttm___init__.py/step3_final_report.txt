{
  "purpose": "The code imports an obfuscated symbol from a local module and exposes 'RTTM' via __all__, with no additional context or activity.",
  "sources": "Import statement from '.rttm' module, reading the symbol 'DSydgayWjEVUWgigxWBjHEXSKFcamich'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "The source is the import of 'DSydgayWjEVUWgigxWBjHEXSKFcamich' from '.rttm'; no data flows to sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name 'DSydgayWjEVUWgigxWBjHEXSKFcamich' is highly obfuscated, nonsensical, and suspiciously generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, involving only an import of an obfuscated identifier and setting __all__ to expose 'RTTM'. No malicious activity, network calls, or data leaks are visible. The suspicious naming suggests obfuscation, which could be benign or malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscated ~0.75, risk ~0.3) are consistent with the evidence. Further review of the 'rttm' module and the actual nature of 'DSydgayWjEVUWgigxWBjHEXSKFcamich' is recommended to determine if the obfuscation masks malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet shows minimal activity with suspicious obfuscated naming, but no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The suspicion is primarily due to obfuscation, warranting further investigation of the 'rttm' module. The current scores are appropriate; no immediate threat is evident, but caution is advised.",
