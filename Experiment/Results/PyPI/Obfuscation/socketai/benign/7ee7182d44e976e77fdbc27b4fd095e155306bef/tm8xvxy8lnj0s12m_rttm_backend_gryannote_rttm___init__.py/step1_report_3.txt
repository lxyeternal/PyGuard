{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set the module's public interface to include only 'RTTM'. It also imports a specific class or object from a local module named 'rttm'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .rttm module",
  "sinks": "None observed; no data is being output, transmitted, or processed in a way that can lead to data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Import from local module 'rttm' to possibly utilize 'DSydgayWjEVUWgigxWBjHEXSKFcamich' within the package, and exposing 'RTTM' as part of the module's public API",
  "anomalies": "The imported class/object has an obfuscated or nonsensical name 'DSydgayWjEVUWgigxWBjHEXSKFcamich', which is unusual and could indicate malicious intent or obfuscation. The filename 'rttm' is generic but does not itself indicate malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an entity with an obfuscated name from a local module, which may be an attempt to hide malicious code or bypass detection. The '__all__' declaration only exposes 'RTTM', suggesting controlled interface exposure. There is no visible malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution. The suspicious element is the obfuscated import name, which warrants further investigation of the 'rttm' module for hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and mostly benign, setting an interface and importing an object with an obfuscated name. The obfuscated import raises suspicion, but with only this fragment, there is no concrete evidence of malicious intent. Further analysis of the 'rttm' module is recommended to confirm safety.",
