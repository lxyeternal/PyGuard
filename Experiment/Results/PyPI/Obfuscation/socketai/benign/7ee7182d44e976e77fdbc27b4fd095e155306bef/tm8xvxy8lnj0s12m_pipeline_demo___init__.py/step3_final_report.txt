  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external data sources, subprocess calls, file I/O, network operations.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file writes, environment variable access, subprocess executions.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (system commands, network, files).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious code patterns, no malicious network activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is either absent or benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. Risk primarily stems from potential untrusted inputs reaching system or network sinks, but no actual malicious activity is observed. Confidence is high where code is missing, moderate where analysis is based on descriptions. Scores reflect low threat levels, with malware and obfuscation scores at zero, and a small security risk score (~0.2) due to potential untrusted data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk is minimal and primarily theoretical, related to untrusted inputs, but no active threats are present. Scores are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "obfuscated": 0,
