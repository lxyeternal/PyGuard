  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing, possibly involving input handling and output generation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from environment variables, user input, or external files. Specific variables or functions used to read external data are not explicitly shown due to the empty input.",
  "sinks": "Data is outputted through print statements, logging, or network requests. Potential sinks include system commands, network connections, or file writes.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs through various processing functions, eventually reaching sinks like network calls or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with typical input/output handling. No suspicious imports or function calls are detected. No hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or unusual patterns are evident. The structure and formatting are consistent with normal Python coding practices. Without specific code snippets, it is assumed that the code performs legitimate data processing tasks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears to be standard and benign. However, due to the absence of actual code content, the confidence level is moderate, and a review of the actual code could provide more definitive insights.",
