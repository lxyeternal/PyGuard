{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports functions or variables from local modules related to audio labeling and core functionalities, and defines an __all__ list for module exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .audio_labeling and .core.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or system calls are present.",
  "flows": "No apparent source-to-sink data flows; imports are static and do not process untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are seemingly random, nonsensical strings, which may indicate obfuscation or obfuscated code, but they are simply imported names. The __all__ list references strings that do not match the imported names, suggesting possible misconfiguration or intentional obfuscation. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific identifiers with unusual names from local modules, possibly indicating obfuscation or generated code. The __all__ list is supposed to declare publicly accessible symbols but contains names that do not match the imported ones, raising suspicion of misconfiguration or obfuscation. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows that suggest malicious activity. No code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module import structure with potentially obfuscated names and a mismatched __all__ list. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet. The unusual identifiers might be a form of obfuscation, but no malicious intent can be determined from this limited code.",
