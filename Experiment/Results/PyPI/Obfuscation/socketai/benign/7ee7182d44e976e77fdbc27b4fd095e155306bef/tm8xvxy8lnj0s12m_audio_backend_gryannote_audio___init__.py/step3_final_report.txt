{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statements from local modules with obfuscated identifiers and a misspelled __all__ list, likely for internal or auto-generated code.",
  "sources": "Imports from .audio_labeling and .core modules, specifically obfuscated symbols; __all__ list defining exported names.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no network calls, data leaks, or external inputs/outputs.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data paths; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated identifiers that are nonsensical; mismatch and misspelling in __all__ list ('AnnotadedAudioData' instead of 'AnnotatedAudioData').",
  "analysis": "The code imports obfuscated symbols from local modules, with no active malicious code or data leaks. The __all__ list contains misspelled and mismatched names, indicating possible obfuscation or misconfiguration. The identifiers' obfuscated appearance raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious behavior. No network activity or data processing is evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.7, risk ~0.2-0.3) are consistent with the evidence. The primary concern is obfuscation and naming inconsistency, which warrants further review of the imported modules to confirm their nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment does not contain malicious code or active security threats. The obfuscated identifiers and naming mismatches are suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. Further investigation of the imported modules is recommended to determine if obfuscation is benign or conceals malicious behavior.",
