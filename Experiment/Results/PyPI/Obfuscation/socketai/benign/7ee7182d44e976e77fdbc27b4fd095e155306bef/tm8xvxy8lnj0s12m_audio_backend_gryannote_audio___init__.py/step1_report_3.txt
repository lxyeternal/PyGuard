{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package that imports specific functions or classes from local modules for audio labeling and core functionalities, and defines exported symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.audio_labeling and .core)",
  "sinks": "No evident sink points that process untrusted data or execute external commands",
  "flows": "Imports source code from local modules; no data flow from external untrusted sources identified",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are seemingly random strings, which is unusual and suspicious; no descriptive names or comments are present, indicating possible obfuscation or hidden intent. The `__all__` list contains names that do not directly match imported identifiers, suggesting potential renaming or masking.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions or classes with obfuscated names from local modules, which could be an attempt to hide malicious behavior or obfuscate functionality. The `__all__` variable suggests exported classes are named differently from imported identifiers, which raises suspicion. There is no visible malicious payload or suspicious network activity, but the use of non-descriptive, seemingly random identifiers is a red flag. No external input or data sources are processed in this snippet. Overall, the code's structure and naming conventions warrant further review of the associated modules for malicious content.",
  "conclusion": "While the code does not explicitly contain malicious actions, the use of obfuscated identifiers and mismatched export names suggests potential concealment. The code should be reviewed in conjunction with the imported modules to assess malicious intent fully. Currently, the risk level is moderate due to suspicious naming but no direct malicious activity is evident.",
