{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up namespace declarations and module aliasing for a package named 'gryannote', likely to facilitate importing specific submodules under different names.",
  "sources": "Import statements for sys and submodules within gryannote (gryannote.audio.backend.gryannote_audio, gryannote.pipeline.backend.gryannote_pipeline, gryannote.rttm.backend.gryannote_rttm). It also reads package resources through __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__).",
  "sinks": "Assigning sys.modules entries for 'gryannote_audio', 'gryannote_pipeline', 'gryannote_rttm', which could influence module resolution during runtime.",
  "flows": "Imported modules are assigned to sys.modules under different keys, which can alter how modules are imported elsewhere in the application, potentially affecting behavior if malicious code manipulates sys.modules or if the module names are exploited.",
  "anomalies": "The code does not execute any code beyond import and module aliasing. Use of __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__) is standard for namespace packages. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily modifies the sys.modules dictionary to create aliases for specific submodules, which is a common technique for namespace management or module aliasing. It does not include any code execution, data handling, network activity, or other suspicious behavior. All actions are typical for setting up package namespaces and module references.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script for a Python namespace package, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It does not perform any harmful operations, leak data, or execute malicious code.",
