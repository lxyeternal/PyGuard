{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up namespace declarations and module aliasing for a package related to audio processing, pipeline management, and RTTM (speech activity detection or diarization).",
  "sources": "Import statements for modules within the 'gryannote' package and the dynamic declaration of namespace and module aliasing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or security issues.",
  "flows": "Import statements and namespace aliasing do not involve data flow from untrusted sources or to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The use of __import__() for namespace declaration and dynamic assignment to sys.modules is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific modules from the 'gryannote' package and then manually reassigns entries in sys.modules to create namespace aliases. The __import__('pkg_resources').declare_namespace(__name__) is used to declare a namespace package. The module aliasing is common in complex packages to support flexible imports. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors. The code functions primarily for package setup and namespace management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily concerned with module import and namespace configuration. It does not contain malware or security risks based on the provided content.",
