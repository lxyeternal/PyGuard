  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated utility for reading specific segments of a binary file. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, with low malware risk and moderate obfuscation concern."
