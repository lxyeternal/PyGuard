  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on suspicious patterns, obfuscation, and unsafe practices.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function arguments, environment files, network connections, hardcoded secrets, input/output data streams.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, environment variable access, dynamic code execution functions (eval/exec), data leaks to external domains.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or input data flow into processing functions; potentially malicious data could reach network connections or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code segments, dynamic execution (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious network connections, encoded or compressed code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code reviews indicate that most snippets are benign, straightforward, and free of suspicious patterns, with high confidence scores. Report 4 uniquely describes obfuscated code, dynamic execution, and suspicious network activity, justifying high malware (0.75), obfuscated (0.7), and security risk (0.8) scores. Other reports are consistent with benign behavior, warranting low malware (0) and obfuscation (0) scores, with slight security risk (0.1-0.2). The overall assessment aligns with the detailed descriptions, and the scores are justified based on the presence or absence of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with high confidence in their safety. Report 4 exhibits multiple malicious indicators, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with only isolated high-risk signals. The scoring is consistent with the described behaviors, and no adjustments are necessary.",
