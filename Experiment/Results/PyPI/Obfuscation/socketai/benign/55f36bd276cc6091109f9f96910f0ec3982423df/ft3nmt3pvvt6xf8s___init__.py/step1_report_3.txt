  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the definition of utility functions or a module to perform specific tasks within a larger application. No clear application or core functionality is explicitly evident from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function arguments, local variables, and possibly environment variables if used. No external input sources like files, network, or user input are explicitly visible in the fragment.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include functions that execute dynamic code, system commands, or network operations. However, none are explicitly present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (function parameters, environment variables) through internal logic to any output or external calls. No explicit data flow to sinks such as system calls or network operations can be identified here.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code constructs, or unusual behavior are evident. The code structure is straightforward and lacks obfuscation or complex dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review indicates the code is a simple, possibly utility-based script or module. It does not contain malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No external data handling or insecure operations are visible. The code is clean, well-structured, and does not seem to perform any malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code fragment, there are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign and serves a typical utility or functional purpose within a larger project.",
