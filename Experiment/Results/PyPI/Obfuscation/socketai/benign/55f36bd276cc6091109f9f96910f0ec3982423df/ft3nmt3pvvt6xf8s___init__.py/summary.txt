  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with high confidence in their safety. Report 4 exhibits multiple malicious indicators, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with only isolated high-risk signals. The scoring is consistent with the described behaviors, and no adjustments are necessary."
