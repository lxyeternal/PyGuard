  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate CLI management tooling with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The primary security issue is insufficient input validation, which could be exploited in a malicious environment but is not currently active. The obfuscation level is low to moderate, and the overall security risk is moderate due to validation weaknesses. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0.2, and the risk score is approximately 0.45, reflecting potential validation vulnerabilities but no malicious activity."
