{
  "purpose": "CLI management of endpoints using outpostkit, with obfuscated function and variable names, primarily for listing and creating endpoints.",
  "sources": "Input data from CLI arguments and external API responses via outpostkit; no untrusted data sources explicitly identified.",
  "sinks": "Output to console via rich.Table; no evidence of data leaks or malicious data handling.",
  "flows": "CLI arguments flow into command functions, which invoke outpostkit API calls; data retrieved from APIs is formatted into tables and printed.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names; duplicate '--name' argument in create command; inconsistent code structure; potential code generation artifacts.",
  "analysis": "The code defines CLI commands for listing and creating endpoints, with obfuscated naming patterns and structural anomalies such as duplicated CLI arguments. No explicit malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network activity are evident. The obfuscation and structural issues could be attempts to conceal malicious intent or simply code obfuscation. The duplicate argument '--name' in the create command is a bug that would cause runtime errors but is not security-related. The use of external libraries appears standard for CLI tools. Given the lack of direct malicious indicators, the malware score is low, but the high obfuscation warrants caution. The overall security risk is moderate due to structural anomalies and obfuscation, but no active threats are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a CLI tool with significant obfuscation and structural anomalies, which raises suspicion but does not provide evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is obfuscation, which warrants further review, but current evidence does not justify high malware or risk scores.",
