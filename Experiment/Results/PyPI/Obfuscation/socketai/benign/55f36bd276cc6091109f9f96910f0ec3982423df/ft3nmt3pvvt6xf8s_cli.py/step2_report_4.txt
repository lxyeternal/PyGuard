  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, compare their findings, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose:** CLI for outpostkit API, login/logout/version/health check.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated variable names, functions managing tokens, no explicit malicious activity, potential data leaks via echo, and handling of secrets.\n- **Security concerns:** Obfuscation, possible mishandling of sensitive data, but no direct malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.3. Confidence 0.6.\n\n**Assessment:** The code appears to be a standard CLI wrapper with obfuscation practices that could conceal malicious intent but no evidence of malware. The main concern is secret handling and obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose:** CLI for interacting with Outpost API, login/logout, version, API requests.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated variable names, imported secrets, no malicious payloads, but obfuscation and secret handling are suspicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.2, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.3. Confidence 0.6.\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, with emphasis on obfuscation and secret handling, but no clear malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose:** CLI for Outpost API, login/logout, API requests.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated names, standard API token handling, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.6, Risk 0.2. Confidence 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** The code looks legitimate, with obfuscation but no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose:** CLI for Outpost API, login/logout, custom requests.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated identifiers, standard token handling, no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.1, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.2. Confidence 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:** Similar to others, primarily obfuscation without malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose:** CLI for Outpost API, login, requests.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated names, no malicious activity, handles sensitive data via CLI arguments.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.75, Risk 0.2. Confidence 0.75.\n\n**Assessment:** No malware detected; obfuscation is present but seems to be a stylistic choice.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n\n- **Code presence:** All reports agree that the code is a CLI wrapper around the outpostkit API.\n- **Obfuscation:** Consistently high across reports, with variable and function names intentionally obscure.\n- **Malware:** Scores are very low or zero, indicating no signs of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Secret handling:** API tokens are passed via CLI arguments, which is typical but should be handled securely.\n- **Behavior:** No evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- The obfuscation and obscure variable names are suspicious but not inherently malicious. It could be an attempt to hide internal logic or protect intellectual property.\n- The code appears to perform legitimate API interactions, with no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- The handling of secrets via CLI arguments is standard but warrants caution if the package is from an untrusted source.\n- The reports correctly identify that the main concern is obfuscation and secret management, not active malicious activity.\n\n### Final Risk and Malware Scores:\n\nGiven the detailed analysis and the consistent absence of malicious activity, I would **adjust the scores as follows**:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0** — No evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.75** — Obfuscation is significant but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Security Risk:** **0.2** — Slight concern due to obfuscation and secret handling, but overall low risk.\n\n### Justification:\n\n- The code functions as a CLI interface for API interactions, which is common.\n- Obfuscation alone isn't malicious, but it warrants caution.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or data theft.\n- The scores reflect the cautious nature but recognize the lack of active malicious indicators.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion**, the package appears to be a legitimate CLI tool with obfuscation practices that could be benign or malicious depending on context. Based on the evidence, I would assign the following final scores:\n\n- **Malware:** **0.0**\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.75**\n- **Risk:** **0.2**\n\nFurther investigation into the imported modules and the context of deployment is recommended, especially regarding secret handling and obfuscation practices.",
