      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and potential secret embedding, suggesting possible malicious intent or backdoor, but no direct malicious activity is observed. Scores should reflect moderate suspicion, with malware likelihood around 0.2-0.3, high obfuscation (0.75), and moderate risk (~0.55). Further analysis is recommended to verify the purpose of the embedded string."

      "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign, with high confidence in their safety. Report 4 exhibits multiple malicious indicators, justifying high malware and obfuscation scores. Overall, the dependency appears low risk, with only isolated high-risk signals. The scoring is consistent with the described behaviors, and no adjustments are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility with obfuscated elements. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The network request in token validation is standard, and error handling is typical. The static analysis suggests low risk but recommends ongoing runtime monitoring if deployed in production."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration management utility with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious behavior or malware but has security concerns related to plaintext storage of secrets. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score should be around 0.6-0.7 due to variable naming, and the security risk score should be approximately 0.3 reflecting the plaintext secrets. The overall assessment indicates no malicious intent but highlights security best practice violations."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is legitimate CLI management tooling with no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The primary security issue is insufficient input validation, which could be exploited in a malicious environment but is not currently active. The obfuscation level is low to moderate, and the overall security risk is moderate due to validation weaknesses. The malware score is 0, the obfuscated score is 0.2, and the risk score is approximately 0.45, reflecting potential validation vulnerabilities but no malicious activity."

The main concern is obfuscation, which warrants further review, but current evidence does not justify high malware or risk scores."

Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores are appropriate, with low malware risk and moderate obfuscation concern."
