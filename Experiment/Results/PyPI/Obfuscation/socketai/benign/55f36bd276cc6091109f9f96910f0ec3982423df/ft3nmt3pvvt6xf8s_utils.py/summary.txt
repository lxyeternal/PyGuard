  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CLI utility with obfuscated elements. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The network request in token validation is standard, and error handling is typical. The static analysis suggests low risk but recommends ongoing runtime monitoring if deployed in production."
