  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling in Python code.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output functions observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks since code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of unusually long, seemingly random class names; no functional behavior, only class definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated, nonsensical names. There are no imports, data reads, or other logic present. The classes inherit from Exception but contain no methods or data. The class names are unusually long and appear to be random strings, which could be an attempt at obfuscation. However, there is no malicious behavior, no data leakage, no suspicious network activity, or other indicators of malware. The code is minimal and appears to be a simple, albeit obfuscated, exception class definition.",
  "conclusion": "The code only contains two custom exception class definitions with obfuscated names. There is no malicious intent, malicious behavior, or security risk observed. The unusual class names are likely an obfuscation tactic or placeholder names, but they do not indicate malware or security issues.",
