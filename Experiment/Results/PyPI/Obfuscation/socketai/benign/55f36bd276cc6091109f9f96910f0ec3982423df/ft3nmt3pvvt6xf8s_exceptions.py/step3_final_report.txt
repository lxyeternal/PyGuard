{
  "purpose": "Define two custom exception classes with obfuscated, nonsensical class names, serving as placeholder or benign exception definitions.",
  "sources": "Class definitions; no data input, environment variables, or external data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data leaks, no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are inert definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names with no meaningful identifiers; no logic or methods; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with obfuscated names. There are no imports, data handling, or logic. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide purpose but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The absence of data flows, network activity, or code execution points to benignity. The high obfuscation score is justified by the class names, but malware and security risks are not supported by the code content. The overall structure indicates placeholder exception classes with no malicious or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated exception class definitions with no active behavior or vulnerabilities. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, and there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks within this fragment.",
