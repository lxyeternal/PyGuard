  "purpose": "Definition of two custom exception classes, likely for use in larger codebase error handling.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data output, external communication, or sensitive operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths; classes are simple exception definitions without behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or avoid detection; no other suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exceptions with highly obfuscated class names. These classes do not contain any methods or logic, serving purely as exception identifiers. The obfuscated class names could be a tactic to evade detection or mask malicious intent, but on their own, the classes are harmless. No data inputs, outputs, or suspicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of two empty, obfuscated exception class definitions. While the naming pattern is suspicious, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment. The classes could be used in a malicious context elsewhere, but as provided, they pose no direct threat.",
