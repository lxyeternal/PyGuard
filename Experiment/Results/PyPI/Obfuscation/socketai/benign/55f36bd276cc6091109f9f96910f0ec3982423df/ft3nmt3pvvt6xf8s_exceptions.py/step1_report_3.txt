{
  "purpose": "Defines two custom exception classes for error handling.",
  "sources": "No data input sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sink operations such as data output, logging, or network activities.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths; code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are random, obfuscated, and do not convey meaningful intent. No other unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code only declares two exception classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. No input handling, no data processing, and no security-sensitive operations. The naming appears intentionally obscure, possibly to hide intent, but there are no malicious operations or security risks within these class definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated class definitions with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obscured class names could suggest an attempt to conceal intent, but with no active logic or external interactions, the code is benign.",
