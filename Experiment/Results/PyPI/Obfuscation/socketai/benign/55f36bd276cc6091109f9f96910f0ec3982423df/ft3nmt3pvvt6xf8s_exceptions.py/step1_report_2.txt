  "purpose": "Define two custom exception classes for specific error handling scenarios.",
  "sources": "No data input sources or external data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No output, data leak, or system effect points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists between sources and sinks as there are no data operations.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names using random characters, no functional code or logic, which might be intended to hide purpose. No imports or other code, suggesting minimal functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated, non-descriptive class names, which do not inherit any behavior beyond standard Exception. The code appears intentionally obscure, potentially to hide its purpose or to serve as a malicious backdoor. However, in isolation, these classes do not perform any actions or malicious activities. The lack of additional code limits the ability to fully assess intent, but the obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet contains only two obfuscated custom exception class definitions with no behavior or logic. While on its own it does not exhibit malicious activity, the obfuscation and minimalism could be used to hide malicious intent in a larger context. Overall, it is suspicious but not definitively malicious.",
