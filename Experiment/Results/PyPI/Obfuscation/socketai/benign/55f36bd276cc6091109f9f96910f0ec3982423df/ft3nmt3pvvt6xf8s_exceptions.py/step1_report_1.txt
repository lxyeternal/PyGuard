  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for use in a larger Python application or library.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; the code only defines classes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only establishes class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are random and do not suggest any meaningful functionality or security-related behavior. No imported modules or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two class definitions inheriting from Exception, with obfuscated class names. There are no data sources, sinks, or processing logic. The class names appear intentionally scrambled, which might suggest obfuscation, but no malicious behavior is evident. No secrets, input handling, or suspicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply defines two custom exception classes with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation could be a simple attempt to hide purpose, but it does not constitute malicious activity.",
