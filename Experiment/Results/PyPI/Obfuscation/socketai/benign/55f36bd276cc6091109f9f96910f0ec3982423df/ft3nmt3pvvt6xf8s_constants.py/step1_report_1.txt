{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define two string variables with version and package name information, likely used for configuration or version tracking.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements that assign string literals to variables.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flow to external systems, outputs, or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the variables are simply assigned static strings.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected. The code is straightforward variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two variable assignments with static string values. No external input, no data leaks, no cryptic or suspicious patterns. The variables seem to indicate version and package name, typical for configuration purposes. No signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The structure is clear and standard.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign code with no signs of malware or security risks. It likely serves as part of a configuration or metadata module. There is no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
