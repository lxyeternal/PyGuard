  "purpose": "Static assignment of version and CLI name variables, likely configuration or metadata.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments in the code: 'uLFEaUOdsJFFZnEMjuMcGtCMsyQngXHn' and 'JIqBLqqUtLHSmWkHTZHAyPQFcHdbceoC'.",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, output, or data flow present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code consists solely of static variable assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no dynamic code, external data, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only two static string assignments with obfuscated variable names. No external data sources, sinks, or flows are present. The obfuscation is limited to variable naming and does not involve malicious techniques such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity. The simplicity and static nature suggest configuration or metadata purpose. No signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is minimal and likely intentional for internal reasons, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static configuration or metadata variables. No malicious activity, security risks, or obfuscation-driven threats are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
