  "purpose": "The code appears to define two string variables, possibly intended as configuration or identifiers.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments to variables",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process or transmit data",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only assigns values to variables",
  "anomalies": "Variables are named in a seemingly obfuscated or nonsensical manner, which could be a form of hiding intent; no other code present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two variable assignments with string literals. There are no functions, imports, network operations, or other behaviors. The variable names appear deliberately obfuscated or nonspecific, which may be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply obfuscation. Without additional context, these assignments alone do not indicate malicious behavior. No data is transmitted, processed insecurely, or interacts with external systems.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited code provided, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal, possibly obfuscated variable names, but nothing malicious is apparent from these assignments alone.",
