  "purpose": "Assign version string and CLI tool name to variables",
  "sources": "Variable assignments with hardcoded string literals",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are set locally",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded version and tool name, but this is common in configuration or metadata code; no malicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two variable assignments with static strings. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. There are no functions, no network activity, or data processing that could indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be part of a configuration or metadata setup. There are no anomalies or suspicious patterns such as obfuscation, hidden code, or dynamic execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving to assign static strings for versioning and tool naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
