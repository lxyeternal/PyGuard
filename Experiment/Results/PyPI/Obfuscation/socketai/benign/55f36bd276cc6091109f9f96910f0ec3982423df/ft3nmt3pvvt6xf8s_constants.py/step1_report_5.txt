{
  "purpose": "Assign version string and package name variables, likely for internal configuration or package setup.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments within the code",
  "sinks": "No evidence of data output, network communication, or use of untrusted input",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output or sink points; simple variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials, or hidden malicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two variable assignments with static string values. There are no inputs, no external data sources, and no operations that could be exploited. The variables appear to store version information and a package name, which is typical in package metadata. No malicious behaviors, obfuscation, or suspicious activity observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, containing only straightforward variable assignments likely used for package versioning or configuration purposes. No signs of malware or security risks.",
