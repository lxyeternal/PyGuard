{
  "purpose": "The code intends to automatically apply AMPRenderer to the output of Django views.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; the code references Django view output and an application of AMPRenderer, possibly as a decorator or middleware.",
  "sinks": "Potentially modifies or intercepts the response object in Django views, but no direct untrusted data sink is evident.",
  "flows": "No detailed flow is provided; implied flow is the application of AMPRenderer to view outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a very brief comment; no anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a one-line comment describing the application of AMPRenderer to Django view outputs. It lacks implementation details, input handling, or data processing. Without actual code, there are no source-to-sink flows, no unusual code structures, or suspicious behaviors detected. The description suggests a standard pattern of response rendering in Django, possibly as middleware or decorator, but no malicious or security risks are evident from the provided fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this comment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a straightforward note about applying a renderer in Django views.",
