  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code snippet and the context.\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports are describing a comment or docstring indicating an intention to apply `AMPRenderer` to Django views.\n- No actual executable code, data input/output, or security-sensitive operations are present in the snippet.\n- The code is purely descriptive, with no logic, data flows, or potential attack vectors visible.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Issue presence:** No, the snippet is just a comment.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; the report correctly notes the absence of executable code.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are both 0, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Since there's no code, no risk or malicious activity is possible.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 2\n- **Issue presence:** No, just a comment.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None; the report correctly identifies the lack of executable logic.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, no data flows, no vulnerabilities.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Issue presence:** No, only a comment.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, consistent.\n- **Justification:** No executable code or suspicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Issue presence:** No, just a comment.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** Correct.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Issue presence:** No, only a comment.\n- **Errors/flaws:** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and security risk are 0, fitting.\n- **Justification:** No executable code or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- All reports correctly identify that the provided snippet is merely a comment or documentation note.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks exists in the snippet.\n- The scores assigned (malware: 0, securityRisk: 0) are appropriate across all reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Estimated malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Estimated obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)\n- **Estimated risk score:** 0 (no security risk in a comment-only snippet)\n\n**Note:** If in the broader codebase this comment is associated with actual implementation that applies `AMPRenderer`, then the security assessment should be revisited with the actual code. However, based solely on the provided snippet, there are no concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with no malware, obfuscation, or security risks evident.",
