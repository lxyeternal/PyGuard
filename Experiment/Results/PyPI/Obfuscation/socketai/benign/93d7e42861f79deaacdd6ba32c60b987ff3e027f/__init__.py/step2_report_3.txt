  "review": "Let's analyze the provided reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Malicious or Security-Sensitive Code:**\n   - All reports indicate that the code snippet is merely a comment or docstring with no executable logic.\n   - There are no input/output operations, data flows, or code that could be exploited.\n   - No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are present.\n   - **Conclusion:** No actual code exists to evaluate for security risks or malware.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Logical Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in stating that the snippet is only a comment.\n   - They correctly identify the lack of executable code, data flows, or security issues.\n   - No logical flaws are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores and Justifications:**\n   - All reports assign malware and security risk scores of 0, which is appropriate given the absence of executable code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable.\n   - The obfuscated scores are 0, aligning with the fact that the snippet is a plain comment.\n   - **Recommendation:** The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n\n4. **Potential Risks or Assumptions:**\n   - Since these are only comments, there are no risks or malicious behaviors to evaluate.\n   - Any claims about potential vulnerabilities would be speculative without actual code.\n\n5. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The snippet is purely a descriptive comment.\n   - No malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present or implied.\n   - The reports correctly identify this.\n\n**Final Estimation:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Summary:**\nThe provided snippet is a benign comment with no executable code or security implications. The reports' evaluations are accurate and reasonable. No changes are necessary.",
