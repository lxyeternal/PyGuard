  "review": "Let's carefully analyze each report step-by-step:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports are describing a snippet that is purely a comment or docstring with no executable code.\n- There are no input sources, data flows, sinks, or actual implementation details.\n- All reports conclude that the snippet is benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the presence of issues in the code:\n\n**The code is only a comment or docstring:**\n- **No executable logic**: No functions, classes, or code statements.\n- **No data handling**: No input, output, or data flow.\n- **No security-sensitive operations**: No secrets, hardcoded credentials, or network interactions.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \n**No issues are present in the code.** It is purely descriptive.\n\n---\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's reasoning:\n\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment: they recognize that the snippet is only a comment and not executable code.\n- They correctly identify the absence of any suspicious or malicious activity.\n- No logical flaws are apparent in their reasoning.\n\n**Note:** Since the snippet is just a comment, there's no room for errors or mistakes in the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Review of the scores assigned:\n\n| Report | malware | securityRisk | obfuscated |\n|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 2       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 3       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 4       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n| 5       | 0       | 0            | 0            |\n\n**Assessment:**  \n- All scores are appropriately zero, reflecting no malicious or obfuscated code, and no security risk.\n\n**Suggestion:**  \n- No changes needed; the scores are reasonable given the content.\n\n---\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n\n- **Scores are all zero**; thus, no justification needed for higher scores.\n- If any report had assigned a high risk, I would challenge it, but here, the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n\n- Since there's no executable code, no data flow, and nothing suspicious, the malware score should remain **0**.\n\n---\n\n### Challenging claims based on assumptions:\n\n- All reports are cautious and accurate, noting the absence of code or malicious activity.\n- No assumptions are made beyond what is evident; the comments are benign.\n\n---\n\n### Consistency of scores with the report:\n\n- All reports are consistent with each other and with the content.\n- The scores align with the analysis: no malicious or obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n### Final overall assessment:\n\n**Given the input, I would assign:**\n\n- **Malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- The snippet is purely a comment with no executable or security-sensitive content.\n- No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation are present.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Score |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| Malware            | 0      |\n| Obfuscated         | 0      |\n| Security Risk      | 0      |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the scores are appropriate. The snippet is benign, with no security concerns.",
