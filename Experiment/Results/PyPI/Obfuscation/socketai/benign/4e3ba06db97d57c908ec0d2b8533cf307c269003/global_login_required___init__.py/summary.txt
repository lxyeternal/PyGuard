  "conclusion": "The code functions as an access control middleware with high obfuscation and dynamic import patterns. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the suspicious dynamic import with undefined variables and obfuscation warrants further review. The malware score is set to 0.2 due to potential exploitation risk, and the overall security risk is moderate (0.4). It is recommended to clarify the dynamic import logic, remove unnecessary obfuscation, and ensure variables like 'module_path' are securely defined before deployment."
