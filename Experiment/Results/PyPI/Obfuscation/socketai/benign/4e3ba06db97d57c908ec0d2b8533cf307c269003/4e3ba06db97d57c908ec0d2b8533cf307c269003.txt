      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malware, malicious intent, or security risks are present. The obfuscation appears to be a simple variable renaming without malicious purpose."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as an access control middleware with high obfuscation and dynamic import patterns. While no direct malicious activity is evident, the suspicious dynamic import with undefined variables and obfuscation warrants further review. The malware score is set to 0.2 due to potential exploitation risk, and the overall security risk is moderate (0.4). It is recommended to clarify the dynamic import logic, remove unnecessary obfuscation, and ensure variables like 'module_path' are securely defined before deployment."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a safe, obfuscated Django test suite with no malicious activity or security risks. Obfuscation is likely stylistic or for concealment, not malicious. The overall security assessment should remain at malware=0, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.7), and a very low risk (~0.2)."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation, but the use of an obfuscated external module as a decorator introduces a significant security concern. Without inspecting the external module's content, malicious behavior cannot be confirmed or ruled out. The scores should be adjusted to reflect moderate suspicion due to the external dependency, with particular emphasis on the obfuscation and potential for concealed malicious code."

      "conclusion": "The URL configuration employs obfuscation and broad regex patterns that could be exploited if view logic is insecure. No direct evidence of malicious activity is present, but the obfuscation and dynamic references necessitate further review of imported modules and view implementations to ensure security."

The obfuscation does not indicate malicious behavior, and there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities."
