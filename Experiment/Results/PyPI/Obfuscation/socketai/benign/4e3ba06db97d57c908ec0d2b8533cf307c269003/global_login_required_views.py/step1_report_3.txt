{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple Django views and functions, primarily for handling HTTP responses, with some use of decorators and imported modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from django.views, django.http, django.utils.decorators, and a local module; function and class definitions including decorated classes.",
  "sinks": "HTTP response functions and class methods returning HttpResponse objects.",
  "flows": "Function calls and class method invocations that return static responses; no data flow involving untrusted input; decorator application does not process external data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an imported module with a seemingly random name, RqiKAzyuIWMOXqxCKpJagFasILlgwQPq, applied as a decorator and directly on functions and classes; no actual code logic or data manipulation present; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious input handling or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is mostly boilerplate for Django views with minimal logic. The imported module with a complex name might indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide functionality; however, it is only used as a decorator and in an annotation, which is typical for access control or permission enforcement in Django. No external data sources, input handling, or potentially malicious operations such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communications are present. The responses are static and do not involve untrusted data. The class attribute modifications and function decorators do not perform malicious actions or data manipulation. Overall, the code appears benign, with the unusual import possibly being a placeholder or an obfuscation tactic, but not malicious per se.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily boilerplate Django views with an unusual import name, but lacks any behavior indicative of malicious activity or security risks. No malware or security threats are detected based on this code fragment.",
