  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, obfuscated Django test suite with no malicious activity or security risks. Obfuscation is likely stylistic or for concealment, not malicious. The overall security assessment should remain at malware=0, with a moderate obfuscation score (~0.7), and a very low risk (~0.2)."
