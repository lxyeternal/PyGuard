  "purpose": "To configure and set up a Python package using setuptools, reading the README file for package description.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.rst file for package description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or harmful actions observed.",
  "flows": "Read README file -> configure setup() parameters with package info.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., XeSDDUZkoaxBiUzqsVAHcPMbmrmHkISD, yfBGyEYzGUwdKzymNAXlnwUzboXhWaKy) that appear obfuscated or intentionally obscure; no use of hardcoded credentials or secrets; no suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily uses standard Python packaging conventions with setuptools. It reads a README file for long description and then calls setup() with various metadata parameters. Variable names are intentionally obscure but do not impact functionality. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. No suspicious or malicious patterns identified.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical setup script for a Python package with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
