  "purpose": "Configuration for documentation setup, including theme selection based on environment variables and static metadata.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'READTHEDOCS', static variable assignments, imported modules",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration points identified",
  "flows": "Static data assignments; environment variable influences theme selection",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious patterns or code execution",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script for documentation purposes, importing standard modules, setting theme based on environment, and defining static metadata. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. Variable obfuscation appears stylistic or auto-generated, not malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign configuration code with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent. It poses no security threat, and the scores assigned in the reports are appropriate. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious behavior, and there is no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.",
