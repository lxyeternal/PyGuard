{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package, possibly providing some utility functions or features for a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to files, executing system commands, network communications, or handling sensitive data such as credentials or environment variables.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input, environment variables, or external files to sinks like file writes, network transmissions, or system commands. The flow pattern should be checked for untrusted data reaching sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs were detected. The code structure appears straightforward. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or suspicious variable names identified.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for typical security issues, including code injection, data leakage, insecure environment variable use, unsafe SQL, or insecure random number generation. It only contains standard library usage and no suspicious third-party libraries. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors were observed. There is no evidence of malicious data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or destructive system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility module without malicious intent. It does not exhibit behaviors indicative of malware or security risks. The overall security risk level is low, and confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
