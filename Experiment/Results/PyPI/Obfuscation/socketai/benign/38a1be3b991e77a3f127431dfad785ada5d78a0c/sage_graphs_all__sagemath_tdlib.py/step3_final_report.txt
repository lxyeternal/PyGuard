  "purpose": "The code is benign, performing straightforward data processing or utility functions without malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input from stdin, environment variables, external files, or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs to files, network, or environment variables, but no malicious activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input to processing functions, with no suspicious external communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are either empty or simple utility scripts with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate. The security risk scores are conservatively set at 0.2, reflecting minimal potential external interactions but no actual vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Confidence levels are high due to the limited code content, and no anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the context. Overall, the reports are accurate, and the scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2.",
