{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple utility that processes data and possibly interacts with external resources, but without further context, its specific purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from function parameters, possibly from environment variables or network if present (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, network connections, or outputs, but no explicit sink is shown in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially leading to outputs or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures detected; code seems straightforward. Lack of explicit external calls or suspicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical data processing tasks without evident malicious intent. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices are observed. The structure is clear, and no unusual features such as dynamic code execution or obfuscated segments are present. Without additional context or hidden mechanisms, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The code is straightforward and lacks suspicious or malicious elements. However, without seeing external dependencies or execution environment, a low confidence score is assigned.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
