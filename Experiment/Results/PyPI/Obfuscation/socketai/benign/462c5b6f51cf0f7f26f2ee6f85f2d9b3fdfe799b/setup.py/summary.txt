  "conclusion": "The script exhibits high obfuscation and inconsistent syntax, which warrants caution. However, there is no direct evidence of active malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation and malformed parameters suggest potential concealment or sabotage, but without concrete malicious actions, the package appears benign but suspicious. Further static and dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."
