  "conclusion": "The code is a standard session management utility with significant security concerns due to unsafe pickle serialization and obfuscation. No direct malicious activity is observed, but the potential for exploitation warrants attention. The assigned scores are appropriate, though the risk could be slightly increased considering the serialization vulnerability. Overall, it is a moderate security risk primarily stemming from serialization practices, not active malware."
