      "security_risk": 0.4,
      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The setup script exhibits signs of obfuscation through its variable and package naming, but no direct malicious activity is evident. The suspicious elements could be attempts to hide malicious dependencies or code. The package should be flagged for further review, especially regarding its dependencies and distribution source. The overall risk is moderate, and caution is advised."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct and benign in isolation. The obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but not malicious without additional context. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware and security risk but high obfuscation. Further review of the 'djqscsv' module is recommended to rule out hidden malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears safe."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated dataset utility functions with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but based on the provided snippet, it is benign. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscation score to 0.7, and the security risk score to 0.2, which are consistent with the analysis."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django queryset-to-CSV export utility. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The security risk is low, and the obfuscation appears to be a code concealment measure rather than malicious intent."
