  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from a local module named 'djqscsv'.",
  "sources": "The code imports from the relative module '.djqscsv', which indicates reading code definitions.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "N/A - the code only performs an import statement with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions for imported items (e.g., rwKjUvAXgsoCRnoszFGHGcEUfoUOLVjb) suggest obfuscated or auto-generated code, but this alone is not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of functions or variables from a module within the same package. The imported names are non-descriptive and appear obfuscated or auto-generated, which can sometimes be suspicious, but in isolation, this is not necessarily malicious. There are no visible data flows, code execution, or network activity. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident. The snippet is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically normal and appears to import obfuscated or auto-generated names from a local module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues based solely on this code.",
