{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from a local module 'djqscsv' within the same package",
  "sources": "Import statement importing functions/classes from a relative module",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no data processing, network, or sensitive operation in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as this is an import statement only",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated imported names (e.g., rwKjUvAXgsoCRnoszFGHGcEUfoUOLVjb), which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but could also be auto-generated or obfuscated for legitimate reasons",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import of four symbols from a local module using obfuscated names. No executable logic, data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The obfuscated names might be benign or could indicate an attempt to conceal malicious code, but based on this snippet alone, there is no evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with obfuscated symbol names from a local module. There is no clear malicious behavior or security risk identified in this fragment. The obfuscation of names warrants cautious review of the 'djqscsv' module contents, but from this snippet alone, the code appears benign.",
