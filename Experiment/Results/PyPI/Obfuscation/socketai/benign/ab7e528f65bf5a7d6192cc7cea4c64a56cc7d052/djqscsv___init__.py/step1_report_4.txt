  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from the local module 'djqscsv'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the local module '.djqscsv'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; import statement itself is standard.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; this is a static import.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which may indicate attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports four identifiers from a relative module '.djqscsv'. The imported names appear to be random or obfuscated, which could be a sign of malicious hiding or obfuscation. No external data sources or untrusted inputs are evident. Without further context, this seems like a standard import statement but the naming pattern warrants caution. No malicious behavior such as code execution, data exfiltration, or network activity is present in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This import statement appears standard but uses obfuscated names, which could be suspicious. However, with only this snippet, no definitive malicious behavior is evident.",
