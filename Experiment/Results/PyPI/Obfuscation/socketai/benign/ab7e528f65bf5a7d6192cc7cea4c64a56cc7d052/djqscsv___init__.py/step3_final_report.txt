  "purpose": "Import specific functions/classes from the local module 'djqscsv'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the relative module '.djqscsv'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects are present in this import statement.",
  "flows": "The code imports symbols; no data flow or execution beyond import occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers for imported symbols; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard relative import of symbols with obfuscated names, which could indicate obfuscation or auto-generation. No malicious behavior, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident from this snippet alone. The high obfuscation scores across reports are justified given the nonsensical identifiers, but these do not inherently imply malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, and the low security risk scores are appropriate, reflecting the lack of active threats or vulnerabilities. The suspicion is solely based on naming obfuscation, which warrants further review of the 'djqscsv' module itself but does not justify higher risk or malware scores.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct and benign in isolation. The obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but not malicious without additional context. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware and security risk but high obfuscation. Further review of the 'djqscsv' module is recommended to rule out hidden malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears safe.",
