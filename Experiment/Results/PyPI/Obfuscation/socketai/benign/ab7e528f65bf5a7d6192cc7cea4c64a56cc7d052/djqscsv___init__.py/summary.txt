  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct and benign in isolation. The obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but not malicious without additional context. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, indicating low malware and security risk but high obfuscation. Further review of the 'djqscsv' module is recommended to rule out hidden malicious code, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears safe."
