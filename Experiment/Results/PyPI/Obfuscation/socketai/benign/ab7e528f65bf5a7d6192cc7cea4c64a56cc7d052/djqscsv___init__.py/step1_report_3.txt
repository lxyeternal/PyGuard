  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from the module '.djqscsv' to be used within the current code context.",
  "sources": "The import statement from the local module '.djqscsv', which likely reads data from the module file.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network operations, file writes, or system modifications are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported functions/variables are made available for use, but no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The imported names appear as random strings, which could suggest obfuscation or generated code; no visible malicious behavior or hardcoded credentials are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a relative module '.djqscsv'. The imported identifiers are non-descriptive and appear as random strings, which could be suspicious, but in itself, this is not malicious. The import does not involve any data processing, network communication, or external effects. There are no signs of obfuscation beyond the naming pattern, and the code is minimal. Without further context, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with unusual naming, possibly obfuscated, but there are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues in this fragment.",
