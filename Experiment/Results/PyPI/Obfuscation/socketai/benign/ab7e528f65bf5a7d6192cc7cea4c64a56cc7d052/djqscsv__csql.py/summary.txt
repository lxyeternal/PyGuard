  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated dataset utility functions with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but based on the provided snippet, it is benign. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscation score to 0.7, and the security risk score to 0.2, which are consistent with the analysis."
