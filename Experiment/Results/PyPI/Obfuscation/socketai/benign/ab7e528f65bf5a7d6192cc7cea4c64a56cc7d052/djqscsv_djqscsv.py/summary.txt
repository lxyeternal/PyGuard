  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Django queryset-to-CSV export utility. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The security risk is low, and the obfuscation appears to be a code concealment measure rather than malicious intent."
