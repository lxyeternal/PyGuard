  "purpose": "The function normalizes a string by replacing spaces with underscores, converting to lowercase, and removing all non-word characters.",
  "sources": "The input parameter CPfbPzCtasCzQKgVhCAVmturumRuvTDY, which accepts external string data.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a sanitized string; no external sinks or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> Lowercase and replace spaces with underscores -> Remove all non-word characters -> Return sanitized string.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated, which could hide malicious intent; however, the code itself performs straightforward sanitization without hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 're' module and defines a function that sanitizes an input string. It replaces spaces with underscores, converts to lowercase, and removes non-word characters using regex. The obfuscated variable names could suggest intent to hide malicious activity, but the logic is standard sanitization. There are no dynamic code executions, external data access, or suspicious operations. The code appears benign and intended for input normalization.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple input sanitization without any malicious behavior. Although variable names are obfuscated, the functionality is straightforward and safe. No malware or security risks are detected.",
