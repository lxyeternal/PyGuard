  "purpose": "The function sanitizes a string by converting it to lowercase, replacing spaces with underscores, and removing all non-word characters.",
  "sources": "Input parameter CPfbPzCtasCzQKgVhCAVmturumRuvTDY",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the sanitized string; no external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input string -> transformation (lowercase, replace spaces, remove non-word characters) -> output string",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard regex operations for string sanitization.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that performs a straightforward string sanitization: it lowers the case, replaces spaces with underscores, and removes all non-word characters using a regex. No external data access, network communication, or system modification occurs. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign utility function for normalizing or sanitizing input strings. There are no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
