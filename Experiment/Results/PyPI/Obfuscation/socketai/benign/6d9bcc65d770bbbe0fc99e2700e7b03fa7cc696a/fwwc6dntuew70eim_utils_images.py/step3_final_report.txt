  "purpose": "Sanitizes input strings by converting to lowercase, replacing spaces with underscores, and removing all non-word characters.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter 'CPfbPzCtasCzQKgVhCAVmturumRuvTDY' provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The function returns the sanitized string; no external sinks or data leaks are involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> lowercase conversion -> space replacement -> regex removal of non-word characters -> output string.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; straightforward sanitization logic; no malicious code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard string sanitization: converting to lowercase, replacing spaces with underscores, and removing non-word characters via regex. Variable names are obfuscated but do not impact functionality. No network activity, code injection, or data leakage is evident. The regex used is appropriate for sanitization purposes. The logic is simple and benign, with no signs of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string sanitization utility with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.6, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the analysis and are appropriate.",
