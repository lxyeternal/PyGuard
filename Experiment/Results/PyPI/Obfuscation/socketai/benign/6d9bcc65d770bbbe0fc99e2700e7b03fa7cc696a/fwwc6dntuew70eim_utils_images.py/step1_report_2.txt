  "purpose": "Function to sanitize a string by removing all non-word characters after converting to lowercase and replacing spaces with underscores.",
  "sources": "Input parameter CPfbPzCtasCzQKgVhCAVmturumRuvTDY",
  "sinks": "re.sub function call that outputs a sanitized string",
  "flows": "Input string -> .lower() -> .replace() -> re.sub() -> output string",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names; no hardcoded secrets; no dynamic code execution; no suspicious network activity",
  "analysis": "The code takes a string input, converts it to lowercase, replaces spaces with underscores, then removes all non-word characters. It appears to be a straightforward sanitization function. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent; they may be auto-generated or intentionally obscure. The function does not perform any network operations, file modifications, or sensitive data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple sanitization utility with no signs of malicious behavior or security threats. The obfuscation of variable names appears to be an attempt to conceal purpose but does not indicate malicious intent.",
