  "purpose": "The function cleans a string by removing all non-word characters and converting it to lowercase with underscores instead of spaces.",
  "sources": "The input parameter CPfbPzCtasCzQKgVhCAVmturumRuvTDY, which receives external string data.",
  "sinks": "The return statement outputs the sanitized string; no external sinks are present.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed by lowercasing, replacing spaces with underscores, and removing non-word characters.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names, but the logic is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The function takes an input string, replaces spaces with underscores, converts all characters to lowercase, then removes all non-word characters using regex. The use of unconventional variable names appears to be an obfuscation attempt but does not affect behavior. The code performs only string sanitization without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, performing simple string sanitization without any malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but not malicious.",
