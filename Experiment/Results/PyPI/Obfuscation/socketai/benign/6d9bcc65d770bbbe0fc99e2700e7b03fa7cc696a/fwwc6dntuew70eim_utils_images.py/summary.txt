  "conclusion": "The code is a benign string sanitization utility with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.6, risk: 0.1) are consistent with the analysis and are appropriate."
