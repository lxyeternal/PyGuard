  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and environment detection utility with no signs of malicious intent or sabotage. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score is 0.2, reflecting minimal operational risk due to environment variable handling and subprocess calls. The code is clear, safe, and typical for such setup routines."
