{
  "purpose": "Import a specific object or module from a local package named 'cicd'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local package 'cicd' and retrieves the object 'wXwltyaijxLanedMEcJMcgdGRfDgxhdD'.",
  "sinks": "The imported object could be used later in the code to perform actions or handle data, but as-is, no sinks are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local package 'cicd' to the current module via the import statement. Without further code, no source-to-sink flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The object name 'wXwltyaijxLanedMEcJMcgdGRfDgxhdD' appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which can be suspicious in a security context. The package name 'cicd' may suggest integration or deployment workflows, but alone, it's not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement importing an object with a seemingly obfuscated or randomly generated name from a local module 'cicd'. There is no further code or context, so no explicit malicious activity is evident. The obfuscated identifier could indicate an attempt to hide the purpose of the imported object, which warrants cautious review if additional context shows its usage. No hardcoded secrets, network calls, or suspicious behavior are present in this line alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated name is unusual and warrants further review when the imported object is used. Overall, the code snippet appears benign but potentially suspicious due to obfuscation.",
