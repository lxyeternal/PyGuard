  "purpose": "Import a specific object or function from a local module named 'cicd'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module file 'cicd.py' or package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or external outputs observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from a single import statement; only a static import is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object name 'wXwltyaijxLanedMEcJMcgdGRfDgxhdD' appears to be a random or obfuscated string, which could indicate obfuscation or hidden intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement from a local module. The imported name looks suspiciously like a random or obfuscated string, which might suggest attempts to hide malicious intent or obfuscate purpose. No other code is provided, so behavioral analysis is limited. The import itself is standard, but the choice of a seemingly random identifier raises suspicion about possible obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement and the suspiciously obfuscated name, there is a moderate concern about obfuscation that could hide malicious behavior. Without additional context or code, this appears suspicious but not definitively malicious. Further review of the 'cicd.py' module and usage is recommended.",
