  "purpose": "Import a specific function or object from the local module named 'cicd'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from a relative module 'cicd' to import 'wXwltyaijxLanedMEcJMcgdGRfDgxhdD'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only performs an import statement with a potentially obfuscated name.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads the specified object from the 'cicd' module into the current namespace.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'wXwltyaijxLanedMEcJMcgdGRfDgxhdD' appears obfuscated or intentionally obscure, which could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing a function or object with an obscure name from a local module. The obscurity could be benign or an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other code is provided, so further context is lacking. The filename and import path are normal, but the imported name's randomness raises suspicion. Without additional context, it is impossible to determine intent or behavior fully.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a straightforward import of an obfuscated identifier from a local module. The obscurity could be benign, but it warrants further investigation into the 'cicd' module and the nature of 'wXwltyaijxLanedMEcJMcgdGRfDgxhdD'. Based solely on this snippet, there is no explicit malicious activity, but the obfuscated name raises some suspicion.",
