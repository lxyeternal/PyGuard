  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, external data sources, import statements, minimal code snippets, dynamic execution points (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Potential dynamic code execution, data exfiltration points, external network connections, environment variable reads.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or external inputs to sinks like eval/exec or network connections, possibly via dynamic code execution or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation score (0.7) in Report 1 without concrete code evidence; suspicion of dynamic eval/exec usage; lack of actual code snippets makes suspicion unconfirmed.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 indicates obfuscation and dynamic code execution suspicion, with scores (malware 0.4, obfuscated 0.7, risk 0.5) aligned with potential but unconfirmed malicious intent. Other reports describe benign, minimal code with scores (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2) consistent with their benign nature. Without concrete code snippets, suspicion remains moderate for Report 1, but overall, scores are reasonable. Slightly lowering the malware score for Report 1 from 0.4 to 0.3 would be more conservative, given the lack of direct evidence. The other reports' scores are appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with appropriate scoring; Report 1 shows moderate suspicion based on obfuscation and dynamic execution hints but lacks concrete evidence. Scores are generally consistent; minor adjustment to malware score in Report 1 is recommended for caution.",
