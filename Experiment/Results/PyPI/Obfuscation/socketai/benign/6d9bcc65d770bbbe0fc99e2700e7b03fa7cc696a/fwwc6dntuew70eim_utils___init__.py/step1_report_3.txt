  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to a Python package intended for general use, but without additional context, it is not explicitly clear.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, environment variables, and possibly from external modules or network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data being written to files, sent over network connections, executed as code, or stored in databases. Specific sinks cannot be confirmed without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input, environment variables, or external modules to sinks like network calls, file writes, or code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are detected based on the provided code snippet. No unusual patterns or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "A step-by-step review of the code shows standard import statements, function definitions, and typical data processing routines. No signs of malicious constructs like code injection, backdoors, or data exfiltration are identified. The code uses common Python patterns and does not contain obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign with no immediate signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious data handling routines based on the provided snippet. The overall security risk is low.",
