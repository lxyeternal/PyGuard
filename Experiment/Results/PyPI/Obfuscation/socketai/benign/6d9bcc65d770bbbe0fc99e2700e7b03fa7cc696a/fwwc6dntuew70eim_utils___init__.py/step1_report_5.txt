  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, user input, and external modules; however, no explicit sources are shown in the snippet.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to the absence of specific code actions or data handling in the snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious or unusual constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated sections. The formatting and structure appear typical for Python scripts.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious API calls. The code appears to be either incomplete or a generic template without sensitive operations. There are no external network connections, no credential handling, and no use of unsafe functions. The code structure and dependencies are standard, with no indicators of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The code looks benign, and there are no apparent vulnerabilities or suspicious actions. The overall security risk is low.",
