{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration script that reads 'README.md' and calls an obfuscated setup function with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; importing a function from setuptools with a suspicious name.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no network or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "File read operation; call to obfuscated function with package parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import and function names; incomplete or malformed function call; presence of a suspicious hardcoded string 'g3s8f4ml99ljbddp'.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated setup script, with nonsensical function and variable names, and an incomplete or malformed function call. The import likely intends to be 'setup' but is intentionally distorted. The code reads 'README.md' but does not process it meaningfully. The parameter 'g3s8f4ml99ljbddp' could be a hardcoded token or secret, raising suspicion. No network activity, code injection, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation and irregular syntax are suspicious but do not confirm malicious intent. The code's structure suggests an attempt to hide its true purpose, but without active malicious actions, it remains ambiguous.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated setup script with no direct evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The primary concern is obfuscation and a suspicious hardcoded string, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Further investigation into the actual implementation of the obfuscated function is recommended before trusting or deploying this package.",
