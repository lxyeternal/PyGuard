  "purpose": "Set up namespace declaration for a Python package, supporting both pkg_resources and pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The import statements (pkg_resources, pkgutil) and the __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import of modules as sources; namespace declaration occurs immediately afterward. No data flows to sinks or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of conditional import to support namespace packages; no suspicious or unusual code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace for a package, first trying to import pkg_resources and fall back to pkgutil if ImportError occurs. This is a standard pattern for namespace packages in Python. No hardcoded secrets, network operations, or code execution based on untrusted input are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a common namespace package setup pattern with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
