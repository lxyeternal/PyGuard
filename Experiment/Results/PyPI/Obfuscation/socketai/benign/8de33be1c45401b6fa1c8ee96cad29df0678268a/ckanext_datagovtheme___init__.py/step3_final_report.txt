  "purpose": "Support for namespace packages in Python, declaring namespace via pkg_resources or extending __path__ with pkgutil.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pkg_resources and pkgutil, conditional logic based on ImportError.",
  "sinks": "None; no data handling, network activity, or untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Import of modules -> conditional declaration of namespace -> modification of __path__ if needed.",
  "anomalies": "None; standard boilerplate code with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a well-known pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. It conditionally uses pkg_resources.declare_namespace(__name__) if available, otherwise falls back to extending __path__ with pkgutil.extend_path(__path__, __name__). There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks. The code is minimal, straightforward, and widely used in packaging. No untrusted data flows or network activity are present. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, with high confidence (1), reflecting the benign and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard namespace package support snippet with no malicious intent or security concerns. The provided reports correctly identify its benign nature, and the scoring is appropriate. No modifications are necessary.",
