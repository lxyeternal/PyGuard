  "purpose": "Utility functions for harvesting, resource handling, metadata processing, URL/resource validation, and rendering within CKAN extensions.",
  "sources": "User inputs, configuration files, package/resource dictionaries, JSON strings, external CSV files, environment variables, static assets, local files.",
  "sinks": "URL construction, HTML rendering, JSON parsing, static asset referencing, file access, template rendering.",
  "flows": "Data from external and internal sources flows into URL and HTML generation functions, JSON parsing, and resource validation routines; minimal validation present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and import aliases; use of 'ast.literal_eval' for parsing data; dynamic URL and HTML generation from external data sources; local file access for assets.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions typical of CKAN extensions, handling resource metadata, URL encoding, and rendering. No signs of malicious payloads, backdoors, or network activity. Use of 'ast.literal_eval' is safe assuming controlled inputs. Obfuscation appears superficial and not malicious. Potential injection points exist if inputs are untrusted, but no active exploits or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility-focused, with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. Obfuscation is minimal and likely incidental. Standard security practices such as input validation should be followed to mitigate injection risks. Overall, supply chain security risk is very low.",
