  "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the presence or absence of malicious patterns based on available information. The scores are appropriate, with a slight overestimation of malware suspicion in report 4, which can be adjusted downward if no explicit eval/exec is confirmed. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate suspicion, consistent with the described code behaviors."
