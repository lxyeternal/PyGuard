  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CKAN plugin focused on theme and facet configuration. Despite obfuscated class and method names, there is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation scores are justified due to naming conventions but do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains at zero."
