      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated setup script with no direct evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The primary concern is obfuscation and a suspicious hardcoded string, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Further investigation into the actual implementation of the obfuscated function is recommended before trusting or deploying this package."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate CKAN plugin focused on theme and facet configuration. Despite obfuscated class and method names, there is no evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation scores are justified due to naming conventions but do not indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score remains at zero."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, utility-focused, with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. Obfuscation is minimal and likely incidental. Standard security practices such as input validation should be followed to mitigate injection risks. Overall, supply chain security risk is very low."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard CKAN extension component with obfuscated variable names but no malicious activity. The primary concern is the potential for URL injection or open redirect vulnerabilities due to lack of input sanitization. Malware is not present. The security risk is moderate, and the obfuscation is superficial. Implementing input validation would mitigate the risk."

      "conclusion": "Most reports correctly identify the presence or absence of malicious patterns based on available information. The scores are appropriate, with a slight overestimation of malware suspicion in report 4, which can be adjusted downward if no explicit eval/exec is confirmed. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate suspicion, consistent with the described code behaviors."
