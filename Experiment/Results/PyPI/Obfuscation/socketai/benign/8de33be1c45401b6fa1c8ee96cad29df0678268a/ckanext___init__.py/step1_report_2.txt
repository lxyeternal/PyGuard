  "purpose": "Declare a namespace package for a Python project to allow multiple distributions to share a namespace.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'pkg_resources' and 'pkgutil', which are used to declare or extend namespace packages.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data leakage or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The code attempts to import 'pkg_resources' and declare a namespace; if that fails, it falls back to 'pkgutil' to extend the namespace path.",
  "anomalies": "The code is standard for namespace packages; no suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses conditional imports to declare a namespace package, a common pattern in Python packaging. It attempts to import 'pkg_resources' to declare a namespace, and if unavailable, falls back to 'pkgutil' to extend the package path. Both are standard practices with no malicious intent. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical namespace declaration pattern used in Python packaging. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
