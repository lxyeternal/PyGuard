  "purpose": "Set up namespace package declarations for a Python package, ensuring compatibility across environments.",
  "sources": "Import statements for 'pkg_resources' and 'pkgutil', and the declaration of '__path__' in the fallback case.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Importing 'pkg_resources' and calling 'declare_namespace' as source, with no significant data flow to a sink.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses standard namespace declaration techniques; no unusual patterns or hardcoded secrets are present. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package using 'pkg_resources'. If 'pkg_resources' is unavailable, it falls back to 'pkgutil' to extend the package path. Both actions are common in package setup for namespace packages. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code execution. The code is straightforward, uses standard library features, and contains no suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for namespace package declaration, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
