  "anomalies": "None; code follows a common pattern with no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical namespace declaration pattern in Python, employing conditional import to ensure compatibility. It does not process untrusted input, perform network operations, or contain obfuscation. All reports correctly identify its benign nature, assigning scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk, with high confidence. The code is straightforward, well-understood, and aligns with best practices, indicating no malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, safe namespace declaration pattern with no malicious or security concerns. All reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
