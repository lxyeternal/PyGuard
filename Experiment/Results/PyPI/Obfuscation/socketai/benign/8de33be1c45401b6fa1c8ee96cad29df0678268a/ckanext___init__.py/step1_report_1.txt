  "purpose": "Establishes a namespace package using pkg_resources or pkgutil for package distribution.",
  "sources": "Import statements for pkg_resources and pkgutil, and the __path__ variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "Imports are executed, and namespace declaration occurs if pkg_resources is available; otherwise, extend_path modifies __path__.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to declare a namespace package, which is a common pattern in Python packaging. It conditionally imports either pkg_resources or pkgutil to declare or extend the namespace. No untrusted input, no data leaks, no malicious logic, and no obfuscation. The code appears standard for namespace packages with fallback mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "This is standard namespace package setup code with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is used for package distribution and modularization.",
