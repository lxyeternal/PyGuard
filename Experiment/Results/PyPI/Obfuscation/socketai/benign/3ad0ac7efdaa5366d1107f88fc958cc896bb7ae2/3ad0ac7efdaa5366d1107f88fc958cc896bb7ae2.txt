The potential concern with 'import *' is acknowledged but does not constitute malicious behavior. The security and malware scores are appropriately set to 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting caution without evidence of threat."

The high obfuscation score in one report is justified based on the function name but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code poses no security risk, and the scores across reports are consistent with the evidence."

      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with some suspicion in Report 2 due to signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution. Without concrete code evidence, high malware and obfuscation scores are unwarranted. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3-0.4). It is recommended to lower suspicion scores unless further code review confirms malicious patterns."

      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated wrapper delegating to an external function. No direct malicious activity is observable, but obfuscation warrants caution. The scores assigned are reasonable; a moderate malware score (~0.2-0.4) and high obfuscation (~0.8) reflect suspicion without confirmation. Further investigation into the external function is recommended before making definitive security judgments."

      "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct and benign in isolation but uses highly obfuscated identifiers, which warrants further investigation. There is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet, but the suspicious naming pattern justifies cautious review of the module contents."

The obfuscation may be for concealment or code protection but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero."
