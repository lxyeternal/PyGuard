  "purpose": "Import a specific object or function 'lrJuvaSDSRadvGMZZwpHPKkXQedQtKvB' from a local module '.swa'",
  "sources": "Import statement accessing a local module '.swa'",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sink evident in the import statement",
  "flows": "Import source flows into the current namespace without external data manipulation",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'lrJuvaSDSRadvGMZZwpHPKkXQedQtKvB' appears as a nonsensical, obfuscated string, which could be suspicious; the module name '.swa' is short and non-descriptive, raising some suspicion but not conclusively malicious",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement importing an object with a seemingly obfuscated or nonsensical name from a local module. No other code or data manipulation is present. The import pattern itself is standard Python, but the naming conventions are unusual and could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent if this is part of a larger malicious package. Since no additional context is provided, the code by itself does not exhibit malicious behavior but raises suspicion due to obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with obfuscated identifiers. While the syntax is legitimate, the naming pattern warrants further review of the module '.swa' and the imported object for malicious behavior. On its own, it shows no active malicious activity but could be part of obfuscated or malicious code in a larger context.",
