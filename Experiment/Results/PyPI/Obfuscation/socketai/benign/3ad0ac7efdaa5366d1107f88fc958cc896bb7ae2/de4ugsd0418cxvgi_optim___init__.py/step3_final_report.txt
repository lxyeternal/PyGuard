  "purpose": "Import a specific object with an obfuscated name from a local module `.swa`.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module `.swa`.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The import loads an object into the namespace; no further data flow is evident.",
  "anomalies": "The object name `lrJuvaSDSRadvGMZZwpHPKkXQedQtKvB` is highly obfuscated and nonsensical, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python import statement with correct syntax. The main concern is the obfuscated naming pattern, which could suggest concealment or malicious intent. No malicious behavior or data leaks are demonstrated in this snippet. The malware score is low (0.1), indicating minimal suspicion based solely on this code. The obfuscation score is high (0.75), reflecting suspicion due to naming. The overall security risk score is moderate (0.25), aligned with the suspicion but no active malicious activity. The scores are consistent with the analysis, and further review of the module `.swa` and the imported object is recommended to clarify intent.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement is syntactically correct and benign in isolation but uses highly obfuscated identifiers, which warrants further investigation. There is no evidence of malicious activity in this snippet, but the suspicious naming pattern justifies cautious review of the module contents.",
