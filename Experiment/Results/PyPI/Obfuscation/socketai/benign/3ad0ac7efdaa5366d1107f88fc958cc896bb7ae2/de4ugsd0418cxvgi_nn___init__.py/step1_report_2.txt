  "purpose": "Import all symbols from a local modules package and a submodule named functional.",
  "sources": "The code reads import statements from local files or modules.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data; no network, file, or environment variable access shown.",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent in these import statements; they only load modules.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'from .modules import *' can be risky as it imports everything into the namespace, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. However, this alone doesn't indicate malicious intent; it's a common pattern but can obscure malicious imports if the modules contain malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which load code from local modules or submodules. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no untrusted data handling. The use of relative imports is typical in package structures. Without examining the contents of 'modules' or 'functional', no malicious activity can be determined from these lines alone. The only potential concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious code if the imported modules are malicious, but on its own, this code fragment does not exhibit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a standard import statement pattern with no evident malicious intent. The only noteworthy aspect is the use of 'import *', which can be risky in larger contexts but is not malicious by itself.",
