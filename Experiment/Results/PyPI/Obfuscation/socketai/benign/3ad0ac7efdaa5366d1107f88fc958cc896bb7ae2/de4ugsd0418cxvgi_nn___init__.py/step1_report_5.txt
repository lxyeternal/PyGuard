{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be importing modules and functions from the current package, likely for use elsewhere in the program.",
  "sources": "Imports from the current package modules: '.' modules and functional submodule",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or data leak points are evident in the provided code",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow identified; imports do not process external data",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative imports is typical in package code; no suspicious or unusual code constructs are present",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements: 'from .modules import *' and 'from . import functional'. These are standard in Python packages to include internal modules and functions. There are no apparent data flows, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious code patterns. The code does not read external input nor writes data to untrusted sources.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a typical package import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. It simply includes internal modules for use in the package.",
