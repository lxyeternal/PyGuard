{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import all contents from a local 'modules' package and a 'functional' module, likely as part of a larger software project.",
  "sources": "Import statements for local modules ('modules' and 'functional')",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted sources are present in these lines",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident, as these are simple import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import from 'modules' could be risky if the module contains malicious code, but not inherently malicious; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code contains two import statements: one importing everything from a local 'modules' package and another importing a 'functional' module. These are standard Python import statements. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activity. Wildcard imports can sometimes obscure code behavior or introduce unexpected dependencies, but they are not malicious by themselves. There is no evidence of data leakage, backdoors, or malicious payloads in these lines.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The use of wildcard import warrants cautious review in the broader code context, but it is not malicious by itself.",
