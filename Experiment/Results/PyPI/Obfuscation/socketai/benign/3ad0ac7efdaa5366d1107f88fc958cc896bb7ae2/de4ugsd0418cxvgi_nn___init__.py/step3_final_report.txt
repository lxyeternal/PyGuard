{
  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from the local module '.modules' and also imports the '.functional' module, likely for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from '.modules' and '.functional'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling present.",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules into the namespace; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from '.modules' can obscure imported symbols, but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, with no execution logic, data processing, or network activity. The use of relative imports and 'import *' is a common pattern in package internal code but can be considered a best practice violation due to namespace pollution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The high confidence in benignity is justified by the simplicity and standard nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements with no malicious or suspicious activity. The potential concern with 'import *' is acknowledged but does not constitute malicious behavior. The security and malware scores are appropriately set to 0, and the risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting caution without evidence of threat.",
