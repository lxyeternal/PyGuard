  "purpose": "The code imports all symbols from a local modules package and a functional module, likely as part of a larger project or library.",
  "sources": "The imports from '.modules' and '.functional' indicate reading local module files.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can be considered a best practice violation but is not inherently malicious; no suspicious code, secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, importing all symbols from local modules. There is no execution logic, data handling, or external network activity. The use of relative imports suggests modular code structure but does not introduce security risks by itself. No malicious behavior or anomalies are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of normal modular Python code. No malware or security issues identified.",
