  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with some suspicion in Report 2 due to signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution. Without concrete code evidence, high malware and obfuscation scores are unwarranted. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3-0.4). It is recommended to lower suspicion scores unless further code review confirms malicious patterns."
