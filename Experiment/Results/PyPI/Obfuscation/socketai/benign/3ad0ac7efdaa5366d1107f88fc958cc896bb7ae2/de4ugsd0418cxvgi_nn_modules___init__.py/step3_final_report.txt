  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network communication, data processing functions, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec), import statements.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file I/O, environment variables, dynamic code execution, data leaks via environment or network.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and untrusted input flow into network communication, data processing, or dynamic execution points; sinks include network and file operations.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation (e.g., eval/exec, obfuscated variable names), dynamic imports, inconsistent or suspicious patterns without concrete code evidence; absence of code in some reports.",
  "analysis": "The reports vary in detail; Report 2 indicates signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution but lacks concrete code snippets, leading to potentially overstated scores. Reports 1, 3, and 4 show typical benign patterns with no suspicious features. Report 5 provides no code, so no analysis is possible. The scores should reflect evidence; high scores in Report 2 are justified only if actual obfuscation/malicious code is confirmed. Overall, suspicion levels should be moderated to avoid false positives, with the highest malware suspicion around 0.3 and obfuscation around 0.3, considering the lack of concrete malicious code evidence.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign, with some suspicion in Report 2 due to signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution. Without concrete code evidence, high malware and obfuscation scores are unwarranted. The overall security risk is moderate (~0.3-0.4). It is recommended to lower suspicion scores unless further code review confirms malicious patterns.",
