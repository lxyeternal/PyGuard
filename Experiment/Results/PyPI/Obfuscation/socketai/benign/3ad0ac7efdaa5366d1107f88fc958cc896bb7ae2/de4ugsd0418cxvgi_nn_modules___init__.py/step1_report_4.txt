  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to data processing or utility functions, but without explicit comments or documentation, its exact intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "Code reads input data from variables, possibly from environment variables or function parameters. No explicit input or external data sources identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include file operations, network connections, or data storage functions. No direct evidence of data leaks or malicious actions in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (if any) through processing functions, but no untrusted data flows identified that lead to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. Code appears straightforward with standard syntax and structure.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks obfuscated elements, unusual language features, or dynamic execution methods. It utilizes standard Python libraries and functions. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or malicious system modifications. The code structure is typical, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns. Without additional context, it appears to be a benign utility or processing script.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems standard and unlikely to be harmful. However, without full context or actual content, the confidence in this assessment is moderate.",
