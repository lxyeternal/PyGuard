  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing or functionality typical for a package, but the specific purpose cannot be determined from the provided snippet.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters, environment variables, or external files (not explicitly shown).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, sends data over the network, or outputs to the console.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, but explicit source and sink points are not clearly visible in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are detected. No malicious imports or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. It uses standard libraries and functions, with no evidence of malicious data handling or malicious side effects. There are no suspicious API calls, network connections, or data leaks. The overall structure appears typical for a legitimate package component.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems benign and aligns with standard Python practices. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
