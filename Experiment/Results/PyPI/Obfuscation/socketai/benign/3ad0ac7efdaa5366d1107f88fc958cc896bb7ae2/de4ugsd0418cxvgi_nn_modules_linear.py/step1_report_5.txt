  "purpose": "A wrapper function that calls another function with three parameters",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'input', 'gamma', 'beta'",
  "sinks": "Calling 'F.xANjmLaPFFxSqtDBrCALukmMpwwdKyPs' with the parameters",
  "flows": "Input parameters are passed directly to 'F.xANjmLaPFFxSqtDBrCALukmMpwwdKyPs'",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated; the called function 'F.xANjmLaPFFxSqtDBrCALukmMpwwdKyPs' is also obfuscated and not standard. No explicit data handling, validation, or sanitization is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function with a highly obfuscated name, which takes three parameters and forwards them to a method within an object 'F'. The usage of obscure identifiers suggests either an attempt at concealment or auto-generated code. There are no input validations, no logging, and no visible security controls. The external function 'F.xANjmLaPFFxSqtDBrCALukmMpwwdKyPs' could be malicious if it performs malicious actions, but from this snippet alone, the behavior cannot be determined. The obfuscation and lack of context are suspicious, but there are no direct signs of malicious activity such as network operations, file manipulation, or data exfiltration in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears obfuscated with minimal contextual information. It simply forwards parameters to an external function, which could be benign or malicious depending on its implementation. No definitive malicious behavior is observable, but the obfuscation raises concerns about potential hidden intents.",
