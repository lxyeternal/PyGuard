  "purpose": "A minimal wrapper function delegating parameters to an external obfuscated function, likely part of a larger process or model.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'input', 'gamma', 'beta' passed to external function F.xANjmLaPFFxSqtDBrCALukmMpwwdKyPs",
  "sinks": "External function F.xANjmLaPFFxSqtDBrCALukmMpwwdKyPs potentially receiving untrusted data; no internal sinks evident",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly from the wrapper to the external function without internal processing",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; no internal validation or logic; reliance on external function with unknown behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, obfuscated wrapper that delegates its inputs to an external function, F.xANjmLaPFFxSqtDBrCALukmMpwwdKyPs. No internal validation, secrets, or suspicious code are visible. The suspicion arises solely from obfuscation and delegation, which can be benign or malicious depending on the external function's implementation. The scores across reports (malware 0.2-0.5, obfuscation 0.7-0.8, risk 0.3-0.5) are consistent with cautious suspicion but lack concrete evidence of malicious activity. Further analysis of the external function is necessary to determine actual behavior. Given the current information, the code's malicious potential is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, but no definitive malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated wrapper delegating to an external function. No direct malicious activity is observable, but obfuscation warrants caution. The scores assigned are reasonable; a moderate malware score (~0.2-0.4) and high obfuscation (~0.8) reflect suspicion without confirmation. Further investigation into the external function is recommended before making definitive security judgments.",
