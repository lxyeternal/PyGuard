  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated wrapper delegating to an external function. No direct malicious activity is observable, but obfuscation warrants caution. The scores assigned are reasonable; a moderate malware score (~0.2-0.4) and high obfuscation (~0.8) reflect suspicion without confirmation. Further investigation into the external function is recommended before making definitive security judgments."
