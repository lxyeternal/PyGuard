  "purpose": "Apply Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to input data, likely for a neural network operation.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'input', and the parameters 'gamma' and 'beta'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the output of the function which could influence model behavior or data flow.",
  "flows": "Input data and parameters 'gamma' and 'beta' are used within the function to produce a modulated output.",
  "anomalies": "Function contains only a docstring and no implementation; no unusual or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code only includes a function definition with a descriptive docstring referencing FiLM. No actual implementation code is present to analyze for security issues. No hardcoded secrets, code injection, or malicious behavior can be inferred from this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be a placeholder or partial code with no executable logic. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious elements. The security risk is minimal, with no indicators of malicious intent or vulnerabilities.",
