{
  "purpose": "The function applies Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to incoming data, likely for neural network feature scaling or conditioning.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'input', 'gamma', 'beta' which are used for modulation.",
  "sinks": "The code does not show any data being sent to external systems, networks, or stored. It operates purely on function parameters.",
  "flows": "The function takes 'input', 'gamma', and 'beta' as sources; without further code, it likely performs a transformation on 'input' using 'gamma' and 'beta'.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. The function is a straightforward description of an ML operation.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, defining a function for FiLM, which is a known neural network technique. No external data sources, network calls, or suspicious operations are visible. The docstring references a class in torchcontrib, indicating it's an implementation detail, not malicious code. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of a neural network feature modulation technique with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is benign and typical for machine learning models.",
