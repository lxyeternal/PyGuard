{
  "purpose": "The function applies Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to incoming data, likely for neural network feature scaling or conditioning.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'input', 'gamma', and 'beta' which are used to modify the data.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; no output or data modification beyond the function scope is visible.",
  "flows": "The function is intended to process 'input' with 'gamma' and 'beta' but the implementation is missing or incomplete.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is incomplete; no actual implementation of the FiLM operation is present. The docstring refers to external class details but provides no actual processing logic.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a function definition with a docstring. There are no executable statements or logic provided. Without implementation, there are no clear security risks, data flows, or malicious behavior detectable. The presence of the placeholder suggests it's part of a larger module, but in isolation, it shows no malicious intent or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is incomplete and contains no executable logic. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this fragment. It appears to be a placeholder or partial definition for a feature transformation function.",
