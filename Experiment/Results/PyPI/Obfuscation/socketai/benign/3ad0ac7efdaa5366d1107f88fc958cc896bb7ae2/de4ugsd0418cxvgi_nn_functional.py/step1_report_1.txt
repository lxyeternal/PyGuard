{
  "purpose": "Applies Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to input data, likely for neural network feature processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'input', 'gamma', 'beta'. No external data sources or untrusted inputs identified.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no data leakage, system commands, or network connections observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the function, which applies a transformation; no external or untrusted sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Code snippet is incomplete; only the function definition and docstring are provided. No actual implementation details or suspicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a function signature and a docstring describing the purpose related to FiLM. No implementation details, data processing, or external calls are shown. Without the function body, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The function appears standard for a neural network module, and no anomalies are visible.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a legitimate part of a neural network feature modulation process. The lack of implementation details limits confidence but does not raise security concerns.",
  "confidence": 0.3,
  "obfuscated": 0,
