{
  "purpose": "Placeholder function signature indicating application of Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) in neural networks, with no implementation provided.",
  "sources": "Function parameter inputs 'input', 'gamma', 'beta'; no data reading beyond parameters; no external data sources or network calls.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external outputs, or data leaks present due to lack of implementation.",
  "flows": "No data flow occurs within the code snippet as no logic or operations are implemented.",
  "anomalies": "Function name appears obfuscated; only a docstring describing purpose, with no executable code or logic; potential superficial obfuscation but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is an incomplete placeholder with only a function signature and a descriptive docstring. No implementation details are provided, and there are no external interactions or suspicious behaviors. The obfuscated function name in one report raises suspicion but lacks supporting code to confirm malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of implementation and malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately zero; obfuscation scores are high only in the context of the function name, which is superficial without code. Risk scores are minimal, reflecting the placeholder nature. Confidence in maliciousness or security threat is very low; the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is a benign placeholder with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score in one report is justified based on the function name but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code poses no security risk, and the scores across reports are consistent with the evidence.",
