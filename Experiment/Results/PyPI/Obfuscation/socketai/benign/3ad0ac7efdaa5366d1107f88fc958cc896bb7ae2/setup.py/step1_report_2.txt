  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring metadata and packaging details.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for long description; no other data input sources identified.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no untrusted data handling or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; the code primarily defines package setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., rtnCerCRRrjgzEgHJlDelOwTtlWwKyXW) that seem obfuscated or randomly generated; no other suspicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules for filesystem and setup operations, reads a README file into a variable, defines version and package info variables, and calls setup() with minimal parameters. The variable names appear intentionally obfuscated but do not contribute to malicious behavior. There are no network connections, credential handling, or malicious payloads present. Overall, the script functions as a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. No malicious or suspicious activities are evident. The code is benign and serves the purpose of packaging the module.",
