{
  "purpose": "A minimal Python setup script that reads a README file and calls setuptools.setup() with basic parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' into a variable; static import statements; static setup() call",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration points; no code execution beyond setup",
  "flows": "Reading file into variable, then passing static parameters to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or network activity; superficial obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward setup script with obfuscated variable names, no malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks. Variable names are superficial obfuscation, not indicative of malicious intent. No suspicious data flows or code execution beyond package setup. The code's simplicity and lack of external communication confirm benign intent. The obfuscation does not impact security, and the absence of malicious code or suspicious behavior justifies a malware score of 0. The obfuscation score is low to moderate (~0.2), reflecting superficial variable name obfuscation. The security risk score is minimal (~0.0-0.1), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
