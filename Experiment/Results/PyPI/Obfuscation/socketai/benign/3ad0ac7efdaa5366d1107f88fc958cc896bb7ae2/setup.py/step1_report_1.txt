  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, primarily to configure package metadata and installation behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data is sent or stored outside the local environment.",
  "flows": "Reads file content to variable; then proceeds to setup without further data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names; no comments or typical setup parameters beyond name, version, license. No usage of the imported modules beyond setup call.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and the setuptools library, reads a README file, and calls setup() with minimal parameters. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, and no code execution or data manipulation beyond package configuration. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The setup parameters are typical, and there are no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as a straightforward setup script for packaging a Python project. There are no indicators of malicious activity, malware, or security risks.",
