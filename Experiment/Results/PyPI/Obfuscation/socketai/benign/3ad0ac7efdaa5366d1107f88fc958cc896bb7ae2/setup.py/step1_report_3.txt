  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, importing modules, and setting package metadata.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reading README file (source) without subsequent data use, no flow to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, but no suspicious behavior is evident. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules, reads a README file into a variable, and calls setup() with basic package metadata. Variable names are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks. The code appears to be a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names, which is not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard setup script for packaging, with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are detected based on the provided code.",
