  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, including reading a README file and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file for package description",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data processing or external data transmission observed",
  "flows": "Read 'README.rst' -> setup configuration",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names; no actual package installation or malicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for setup. It reads a README file and assigns static strings to variables, then calls setup with package metadata. There is no indication of code execution beyond package configuration, no external communications, no hardcoded credentials, and no suspicious behaviors. Variable names are obfuscated but do not affect security assessment. The code appears standard for a setup script, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for packaging a Python module. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident.",
