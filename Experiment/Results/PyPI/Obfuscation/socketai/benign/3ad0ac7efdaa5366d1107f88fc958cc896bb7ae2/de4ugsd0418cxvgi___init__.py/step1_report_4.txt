  "purpose": "This code imports modules 'nn' and 'optim' from the current package, likely for neural network and optimization functionalities.",
  "sources": "The code reads module imports from the current package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks present; no untrusted data handling or external communications.",
  "flows": "Import statements, no data flow or data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with only import statements; no suspicious or unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from the current package, which is typical in Python packages to organize modules. No data processing, external connections, or malicious patterns are present. The minimal code suggests standard modular imports without any obfuscated or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing standard module imports without any malicious or suspicious activity.",
