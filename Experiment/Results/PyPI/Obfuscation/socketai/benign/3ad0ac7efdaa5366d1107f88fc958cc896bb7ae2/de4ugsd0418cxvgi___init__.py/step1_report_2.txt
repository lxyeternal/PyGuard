  "purpose": "Import local modules 'nn' and 'optim' within the package for neural network and optimization functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules 'nn' and 'optim' from the same package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in the code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from local modules within the package. There are no embedded data inputs, no external network calls, no dynamic code execution, and no other operations that could pose security risks. The imports appear standard for modular code organization in Python projects.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing straightforward local module imports with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
