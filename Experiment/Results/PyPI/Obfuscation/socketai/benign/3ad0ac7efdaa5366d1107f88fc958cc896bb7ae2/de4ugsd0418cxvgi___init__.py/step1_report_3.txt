  "purpose": "The code imports modules named 'nn' and 'optim' from the current package, likely related to neural networks and optimization routines.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the current package modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or potential data leakage points are evident in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present in this minimal snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal with only import statements; no unusual or suspicious code behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet only contains relative import statements, which are standard in Python packages for modular organization. There are no indications of code execution, data processing, or network activity. The absence of additional code limits the scope of analysis but also means there are no obvious security concerns or malicious behaviors within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple, non-malicious snippet of code performing module imports. No malware or security risks are detectable based on this minimal content.",
