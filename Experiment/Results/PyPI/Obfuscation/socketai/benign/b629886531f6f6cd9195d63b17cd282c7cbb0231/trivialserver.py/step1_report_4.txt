{
  "purpose": "To start a simple HTTP server that serves files from the current directory on port 8001.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input or untrusted data; uses hardcoded port number and standard library classes.",
  "sinks": "Uses TCPServer and SimpleHTTPRequestHandler to listen on a port and serve files; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; server setup is static with no dynamic or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no clear reason for such obfuscation, which could be suspicious but not malicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries to create a basic HTTP server. Variables are named obfuscatedly, but their use is straightforward: setting a port, defining a request handler, creating a TCP server, and starting the server loop. No external data input, no data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment, but does not introduce malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This script sets up a basic, non-malicious HTTP server. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated variable names, which are not inherently malicious. There are no indicators of malware or malicious behavior.",
