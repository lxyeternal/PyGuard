  "purpose": "A simple Python HTTP server serving files from the current directory on port 8001.",
  "sources": "Standard library modules: http.server and socketserver; variable assignments for port and class handlers.",
  "sinks": "Serving files over network; potential exposure of local files if misconfigured.",
  "flows": "Initialization of server variables -> creation of TCPServer instance -> serve_forever loop.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or external inputs; superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of a static file server using Python's standard libraries. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but map directly to standard classes and values. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network connections to suspicious domains. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely to hide variable names, but does not indicate malicious intent. The server exposes files from the current directory, which could be a security concern if misused, but this is a known characteristic of such servers, not malicious code. The malware score is correctly assigned as 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The obfuscation score is moderate (around 0.5), justified by the variable name obfuscation. The security risk score is low (~0.2), considering the benign nature but potential for unintentional exposure if deployed insecurely.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, superficial obfuscation of a standard static file server. No malicious activity or supply chain threat is evident. The scores should reflect no malware, moderate obfuscation, and low risk.",
