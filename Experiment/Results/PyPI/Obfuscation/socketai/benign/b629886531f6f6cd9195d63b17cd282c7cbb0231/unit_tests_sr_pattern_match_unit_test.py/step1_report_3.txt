  "purpose": "This script tests date-based directory pattern generation by setting patterns and verifying date calculations.",
  "sources": "Reads from system time functions (time.gmtime, time.localtime, time.strftime, time.mktime) and configuration via sr_config()",
  "sinks": "Uses sr_config().set_dir_pattern to process pattern strings; outputs via print statements",
  "flows": "Inputs from system time and configuration settings flow into pattern setting functions; outputs are printed for verification",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function names, no direct user input or untrusted data sources; pattern setting involves formatted strings but no apparent malicious use",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions with non-descriptive, obfuscated names, performing date calculations and pattern setting. It imports configuration from an external module (sr_config) and applies date-based patterns, printing the results for validation. No user input or external untrusted data is processed. The patterns involve date calculations for testing purposes. The code does not connect to networks, access files, or execute commands that would be suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are evident. The function names and structure suggest obfuscation but no malicious intent. Overall, it appears to be a testing script for date pattern functions without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a date pattern testing script with obfuscated names, performing internal calculations and pattern setting without malicious intent. It does not exhibit malware behavior or security risks. The overall security risk is very low.",
