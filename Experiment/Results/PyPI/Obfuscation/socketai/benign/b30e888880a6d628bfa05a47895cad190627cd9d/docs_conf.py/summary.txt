  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain compromise, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain very low. The code poses no security threat and can be considered safe."
