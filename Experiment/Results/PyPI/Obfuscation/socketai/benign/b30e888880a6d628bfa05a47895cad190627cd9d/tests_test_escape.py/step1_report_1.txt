  "purpose": "This code appears to initialize a web server that responds to HTTP requests, potentially for serving web content or API responses.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, user input from HTTP requests",
  "sinks": "HTTP response output, possibly database or file operations if present",
  "flows": "Input from HTTP requests or environment variables flowing into response generation or data processing functions",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no unusual or suspicious code patterns observed. The code uses standard libraries and straightforward logic.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a web server using standard Python libraries, handles HTTP requests, and responds accordingly. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors. No suspicious network activity or obfuscated logic detected. The code seems to follow typical server pattern with no anomalies that suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. It appears to be a standard web server implementation with no malicious or suspicious elements.",
