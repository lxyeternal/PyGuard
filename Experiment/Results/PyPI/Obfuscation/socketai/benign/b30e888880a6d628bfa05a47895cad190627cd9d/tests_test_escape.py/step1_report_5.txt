{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions. It does not have an immediately obvious malicious purpose.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; the code does not read external data, user input, or environment variables directly.",
  "sinks": "No dangerous or sensitive sinks such as network connections, file writes, or command executions are detected.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are evident; the code primarily performs computations or manipulations within local variables.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are observed. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear variable usage and no signs of obfuscated or malicious constructs. It does not interact with external systems, does not execute dynamic code, and does not handle untrusted data. There are no suspicious imports, no network or system calls, and no hidden backdoors. Overall, it appears to be a benign utility or algorithm implementation with standard Python features.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the current analysis, the code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a normal, benign Python script without obfuscation or malicious intent.",
