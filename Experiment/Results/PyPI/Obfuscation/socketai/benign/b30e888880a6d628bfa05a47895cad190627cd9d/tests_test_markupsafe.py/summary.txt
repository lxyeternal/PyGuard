  "conclusion": "The code is mostly benign with some suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution. Scores are appropriate; minor adjustments could be made if eval/exec are confirmed to process untrusted data. Overall, the supply chain risk remains low, but vigilance is advised where dynamic code execution is involved."
