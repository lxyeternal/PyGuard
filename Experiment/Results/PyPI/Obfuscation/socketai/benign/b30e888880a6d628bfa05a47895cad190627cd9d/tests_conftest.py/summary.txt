  "conclusion": "Report 1 indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to unsafe eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation, warranting caution. Reports 2, 3, and 4 are consistent with benign code, showing no suspicious patterns. Scores are appropriate and justified based on the provided summaries. Overall, the analysis supports the current scoring, with Report 1 requiring attention, and others being safe."
