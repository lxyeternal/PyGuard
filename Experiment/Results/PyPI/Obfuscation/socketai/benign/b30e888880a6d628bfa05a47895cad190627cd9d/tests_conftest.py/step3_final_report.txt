  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and suspicious constructs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, hardcoded secrets, external data sources, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system, environment variables, system commands, dynamic eval/exec calls.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (env vars, input) to sinks (eval/exec, network, file operations), often via untrusted or unvalidated pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, unnecessary complexity, suspicious control flow, or unvalidated external data.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion if it uses eval/exec with untrusted input, contains hardcoded secrets, or shows obfuscation. Benign code lacks these patterns, performing standard data processing without suspicious data flows. The scores assigned reflect these observations: high malware (0.8) and risk (0.85) for suspicious patterns; low or zero for benign code. Confidence levels are consistent with the evidence; the structure and reasoning support the scoring. Without actual code snippets, the assessment relies on descriptions, but the reasoning aligns with standard security analysis practices.",
  "conclusion": "Report 1 indicates a high likelihood of malicious behavior due to unsafe eval/exec, hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation, warranting caution. Reports 2, 3, and 4 are consistent with benign code, showing no suspicious patterns. Scores are appropriate and justified based on the provided summaries. Overall, the analysis supports the current scoring, with Report 1 requiring attention, and others being safe.",
