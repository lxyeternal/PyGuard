{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for a generic utility or library function, but without explicit comments or documentation, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the 'input_data' variable, environment variables, or external configuration files if present; uses standard library functions for data processing.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs data via print statements, writes to files, or network connections if present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, possibly reaching output or storage points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets observed; no obfuscated code or suspicious language features. The code structure is straightforward with no unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard data processing tasks, reads input, manipulates data, and outputs results. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication to suspicious domains, data exfiltration, or backdoors. No code injection, unsafe SQL, or use of insecure random number generation is evident. The code is clean and lacks suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility script with no signs of supply chain attacks or sabotage.",
