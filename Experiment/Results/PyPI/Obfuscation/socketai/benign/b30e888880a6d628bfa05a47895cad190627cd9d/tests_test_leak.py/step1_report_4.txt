{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some data processing or system interaction based on the imported modules and code structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user inputs, environment variables, or external files (exact sources not specified due to missing code).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or command executions if present in the full code, but no explicit sinks are identified in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as network or file system operations. Specific flows cannot be detailed without more code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious variable names are evident. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The code structure appears normal. Lack of complete code limits further anomaly detection.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common security issues such as hardcoded secrets, malicious network activity, or suspicious behavior. No such elements are visible in the provided snippet. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscation are present. Due to incomplete code, some assumptions are made, and confidence is moderate.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears benign but is incomplete, so a thorough review of the entire codebase is recommended for full certainty.",
  "confidence": 0.7,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
