{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions and protocols for HTML escaping and safe markup handling, primarily to sanitize and safely display user-input or untrusted text in HTML contexts.",
  "sources": "The function LehBJyqfsPMRpYFXDbsDoHKpSUccUbio reads input objects and converts them into escaped HTML-safe markup.",
  "sinks": "The function outputs Markup objects which could be used in HTML rendering. No direct sinks for untrusted data leading to system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input objects are processed by LehBJyqfsPMRpYFXDbsDoHKpSUccUbio, which escapes special characters and returns safe markup; the flow from untrusted input to safe HTML output is clear, with no external or system-level data leakage observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious network activity are present. The code appears to be standard for safe HTML escaping.",
  "analysis": "The code defines protocols for HTML escaping and a function to escape special characters (&, <, >, ', \") in objects. It handles objects with __html__ method or specific escape logic, returning a Markup object. The import statements include optional native extensions, but no malicious imports. The comments are standard and describe safe HTML practices. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or credential handling are present. The code follows typical patterns for secure markup escaping and appears to be benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard HTML escaping utility intended to safely handle untrusted input for web display. It does not contain any malicious behavior or malware. It is designed for safe HTML markup rendering, with no evidence of sabotage or security risks.",
