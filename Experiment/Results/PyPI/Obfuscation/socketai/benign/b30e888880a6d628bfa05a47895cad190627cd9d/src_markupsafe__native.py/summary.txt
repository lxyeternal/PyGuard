  "conclusion": "The code in reports 1, 3, and 4 shows significant signs of obfuscation and potential malicious intent, warranting higher malware scores (around 0.7-0.8). Reports 2 and 5 are benign. The current scores are generally appropriate but can be refined to better reflect the observed suspicious patterns, especially increasing malware suspicion in reports 1, 3, and 4. No further action needed unless additional context reveals confirmed malicious activity."
