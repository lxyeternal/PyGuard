  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a utility or application logic, but no explicit purpose is discernible from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and user input prompts; also from configuration files or command-line arguments (if any).",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted input is used in file operations, network requests, or sensitive data handling. Specific sinks are not clearly visible due to the absence of the actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment variables, user input) to processing functions, and possibly to output or network communication functions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visibly present. The code does not contain obfuscated or malicious constructs. No suspicious network connections or system modifications are evident. The snippet lacks signs of malware such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or cryptomining activities.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed for common security issues and malicious behavior. It reads inputs from standard sources but does not show any dangerous or suspicious activity. No hardcoded secrets or unusual patterns are detected. The structure is straightforward, and no signs of obfuscation or malicious code segments are present. Due to the limited snippet, some assumptions are made, but nothing malicious is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious data flows or anomalies detected.",
