  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating moderate suspicion. While no definitive malicious activity is confirmed, the potential for malicious behavior warrants a malware score of 0.5, obfuscation score of 0.75, and security risk of 0.6. The overall assessment suggests cautious handling and further dynamic analysis if possible."
