  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "eval/exec calls, hardcoded URLs, environment variables, subprocess calls, unused imports.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, dynamic code execution, environment variable access, subprocess execution.",
  "flows": "Input sources (eval/exec, environment variables) leading to network or file operations, dynamic code paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated code segments, dynamic execution, unused imports, subprocess calls without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, which are typical in malicious scripts. No explicit malicious payloads like data exfiltration or backdoors are confirmed, but signs of potential malicious intent are present. The use of eval/exec, hardcoded URLs, and subprocess calls without validation raise security concerns. Benign patterns include standard library usage and absence of obfuscation in some parts. Overall, the code warrants cautious scoring, with moderate malware and security risk levels due to obfuscation and dynamic behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, indicating moderate suspicion. While no definitive malicious activity is confirmed, the potential for malicious behavior warrants a malware score of 0.5, obfuscation score of 0.75, and security risk of 0.6. The overall assessment suggests cautious handling and further dynamic analysis if possible.",
