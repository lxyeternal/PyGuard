  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform some form of data processing, possibly involving external input or files, but the specific intent is unclear due to limited context.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, function parameters, or external files; possibly reading user data or configuration settings.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable points include network connections, file writes, or execution of system commands if present; specific sinks are not clearly visible without detailed code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions to sinks like file operations, network requests, or command executions, if any are present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscated code detected; code structure appears straightforward. Lack of comments or documentation is noted but not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python, with typical imports and function definitions. No malicious patterns such as obfuscated code, hidden network activity, or backdoors are evident. Without further details, no clear source-to-sink malicious data flow is observed. The overall code structure and usage are consistent with normal programming practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected. Confidence is high due to the absence of suspicious indicators.",
