  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input functions (e.g., input()), environment variables, network requests, file reads, encoded strings, dynamic code execution (eval/exec).",
  "sinks": "Network communication, environment variables, file system, system commands, data leaks, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network requests, dynamic code execution, or data processing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation techniques (encoded strings, eval/exec), suspicious network activity, hardcoded URLs, dynamic code execution, unusual data flows.",
  "analysis": "Most reports describe benign, straightforward code with no suspicious API calls, obfuscation, or malicious patterns, supported by high confidence scores and low malware/security risk scores. Report 5 indicates obfuscation, suspicious network activity, and dynamic code execution, justifying higher malware (0.6-0.7), obfuscation (0.8), and security risk (0.7) scores. The assessments are consistent with the described behaviors. Benign reports show no signs of malicious intent, while the suspicious report's indicators justify elevated scores. Overall, the scoring aligns with the analysis, with minor adjustments to reflect the evidence in report 5.",
  "conclusion": "The code in most reports appears safe, with low malware and obfuscation scores, and minimal security risk. Report 5 demonstrates obfuscation and suspicious network activity, warranting higher scores. The assessments are justified and consistent with the provided descriptions.",
