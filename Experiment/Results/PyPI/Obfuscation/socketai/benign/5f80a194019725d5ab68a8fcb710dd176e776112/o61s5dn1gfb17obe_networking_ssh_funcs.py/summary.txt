  "conclusion": "The code functions as a remote SSH management toolkit with capabilities that could be exploited maliciously if misused. No active malware signatures are present, but high obfuscation and flexible remote control features justify a cautious security stance. The overall malware likelihood is low, but the potential for misuse warrants careful review and validation before deployment."
