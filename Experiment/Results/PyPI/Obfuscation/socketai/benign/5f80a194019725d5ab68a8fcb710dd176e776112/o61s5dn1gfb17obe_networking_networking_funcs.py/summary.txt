  "conclusion": "The code is a network reconnaissance utility with obfuscated structure. No evidence of malicious payloads or malware is found. Its activities could be misused for malicious purposes, but the code itself is not malicious. The malware score is set to 0.2 to reflect reconnaissance capabilities, obfuscation is moderate (0.4), and overall security risk is moderate (0.3). These scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's intent."
