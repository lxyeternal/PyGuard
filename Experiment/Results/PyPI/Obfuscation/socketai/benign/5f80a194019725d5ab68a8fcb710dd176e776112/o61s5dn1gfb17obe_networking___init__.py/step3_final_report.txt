  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, obfuscation patterns, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), hardcoded secrets, suspicious imports, and unusual code structures.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, system modifications, network communications, or execution of malicious payloads triggered by untrusted inputs.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input parsing or environment variables leading to sinks like network calls, file modifications, or code execution points.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic code execution, misleading variable names, suspicious imports, or unusual control flow patterns.",
  "analysis": "The reports collectively indicate that Report 1 shows signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, justifying a moderate malware score (0.4) and high obfuscated score (0.8). The confidence level (0.6) reflects suspicion but lacks concrete evidence. Other reports lack code or show benign patterns, with scores appropriately set to zero or low values. The consistency between analysis and scores is maintained across all reports, with no evident contradictions. Slight adjustments could be made if dynamic analysis confirms malicious payloads in Report 1, potentially increasing its malware score, but current data supports the existing scores.",
  "conclusion": "Scores are generally consistent with the provided summaries and typical indicators. Report 1's suspicion justifies a moderate malware score and high obfuscation score, while other reports are benign. No significant discrepancies are identified. The current scoring accurately reflects the analyzed data, with room for refinement upon further dynamic analysis.",
