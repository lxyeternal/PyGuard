      "conclusion": "The assessment confirms that reports 1-4 are benign with appropriate low scores, while report 5 demonstrates significant malicious indicators justifying high scores. A slight score adjustment for report 5's malware level enhances accuracy. The overall security posture indicates a low risk for most packages but highlights the need for caution with the suspicious dependency."

      "conclusion": "The code is a remote node management framework with powerful capabilities that could be exploited if inputs are not validated. No explicit malware is detected, but insecure command execution and obfuscation pose security concerns. Proper input validation, avoiding unsafe system calls, and code de-obfuscation are recommended to mitigate risks."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits patterns commonly associated with obfuscated malware, such as function name obfuscation and command-line argument manipulation. While no direct malicious activity is visible, the suspicious patterns warrant caution. The overall malware score should be around 0.7, obfuscation at 0.8, and security risk at 0.75, reflecting high suspicion but lacking definitive proof."

      "conclusion": "The code is a credential and node management utility with superficial obfuscation and insecure credential handling. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The obfuscation is likely superficial, and the security risk is low but warrants caution regarding credential security practices."

The main security issues relate to data leakage and error handling practices. The assigned scores of malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.4, and risk = 0.3 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a remote SSH management toolkit with capabilities that could be exploited maliciously if misused. No active malware signatures are present, but high obfuscation and flexible remote control features justify a cautious security stance. The overall malware likelihood is low, but the potential for misuse warrants careful review and validation before deployment."

      "conclusion": "Scores are generally consistent with the provided summaries and typical indicators. Report 1's suspicion justifies a moderate malware score and high obfuscation score, while other reports are benign. No significant discrepancies are identified. The current scoring accurately reflects the analyzed data, with room for refinement upon further dynamic analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code is a network reconnaissance utility with obfuscated structure. No evidence of malicious payloads or malware is found. Its activities could be misused for malicious purposes, but the code itself is not malicious. The malware score is set to 0.2 to reflect reconnaissance capabilities, obfuscation is moderate (0.4), and overall security risk is moderate (0.3). These scores are consistent with the analysis and the code's intent."
