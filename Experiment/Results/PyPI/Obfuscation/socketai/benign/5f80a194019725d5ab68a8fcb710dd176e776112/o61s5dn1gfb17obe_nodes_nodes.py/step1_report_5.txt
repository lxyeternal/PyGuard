{
  "purpose": "This code appears to manage nodes and credentials within a network or hierarchical structure, allowing for adding, editing, and displaying node attributes and credentials.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as 'input()' for user prompts, 'getpass()' for password inputs, and object attribute access for credentials and node details.",
  "sinks": "Display output via 'print()' statements; modifications to credentials and node attributes; potential input from untrusted users.",
  "flows": "User input flows into credential management and node attribute updates; input prompts lead to modifications of internal data structures; display functions read from data structures for output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secret keys, or suspicious IP addresses are present. The code uses interactive input and print statements but lacks any obfuscated code or hidden backdoors. No network activity or system modification code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines classes for nodes with methods to display and modify their attributes and credentials. It relies on user input for modifications and displays data via console outputs. There is no network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration present. Credential management involves standard input prompts and dictionary manipulations. No suspicious or malicious logic such as data theft, external connections, or backdoors is evident. The code is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior. Overall, it functions as an interactive node management utility without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a node and credential management tool with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It appears to be a benign administrative script relying on user input for operation. No suspicious or malicious activities are detected.",
