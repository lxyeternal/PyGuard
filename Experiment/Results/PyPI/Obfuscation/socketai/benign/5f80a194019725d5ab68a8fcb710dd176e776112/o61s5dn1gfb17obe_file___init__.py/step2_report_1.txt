  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the details, and evaluate the scores and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code appears benign, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malware. The confidence is high (0.9), and the malware score is 0.\n- **Assessment:** No issues identified. The security risk score of 0.2 seems slightly high given the benign analysis, but perhaps it's a default low-level concern.\n- **Verdict:** The report's conclusion and scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Very limited code, no apparent malicious activity, and a moderate confidence (0.6). The malware score is 0.\n- **Assessment:** Due to the minimal content, the cautious approach is justified. No evidence of malware or obfuscation.\n- **Verdict:** The low security risk score aligns with the lack of evidence. The malware score of 0 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Slightly more detailed, but still no signs of malicious activity, with high confidence (0.9). Malware score is 0.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis appears thorough, and the conclusions are consistent.\n- **Verdict:** Scores and conclusions are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code shows some hardcoded values and variables but no clear malicious activity. Confidence is 0.7, malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** The presence of hardcoded values warrants caution, but without evidence of malicious intent, the low malware score is justified.\n- **Verdict:** The security risk score of 0.2 seems acceptable, though slightly cautious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs environment variable reads and network requests but no suspicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence is 0.8, malware score 0.\n- **Assessment:** These are common benign operations. The conclusion aligns with the analysis.\n- **Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Scores:** All are 0, which aligns with the detailed analyses. No evidence of malicious code or behavior is present.\n- **Obfuscated Scores:** All are 0, consistent with the reports indicating no obfuscation.\n- **Risk Scores:** Mostly low (0.2), reflecting a cautious but justified stance given the limited suspicious indicators.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The scores across all reports are consistent with their respective analyses.\n- No adjustments needed based on the current information.\n- Given the absence of malware, obfuscation, or high-risk indicators, an overall **malware score of 0**, **obfuscated score of 0**, and a **risk score around 0.2** are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**My Overall Estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese reflect a low-security concern, with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation.",
