  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on code analysis.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, network requests, hardcoded values, input/output functions, data processing routines.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, environment variable access, data processing points that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, network data) to sinks (network, file, environment), with no suspicious or malicious payloads detected.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of hardcoded values, environment variable reads, and network requests; no obfuscation or malicious patterns identified.",
  "analysis": "The code shows benign patterns with no suspicious network activity, no hardcoded secrets that are malicious, and no obfuscation. The confidence levels are high (0.6 to 0.9), and the malware scores are all zero, indicating no malicious intent. The security risk scores are low (0.2), justified by the benign nature of the operations. The absence of suspicious domains, malicious payloads, or obfuscation supports a conclusion of low risk and no malware.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears safe with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score of 0.2 and malware score of 0 are appropriate, reflecting a cautious but justified assessment.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
