{
  "purpose": "The code manages hierarchical nodes, allowing adding, deleting, and visualizing nodes with IP addresses and parent-child relationships.",
  "sources": "User inputs for node IDs and IP addresses, node data structures, and child node lists.",
  "sinks": "Print statements displaying node hierarchy and internal data, potential data leakage.",
  "flows": "User input for node IDs/IPs → node lookup and modification functions → print statements for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of broad try-except blocks masking errors, variable names that appear intentionally complex, lack of input validation, and data exposure via print statements.",
  "analysis": "The code performs node management and visualization without network activity, cryptography, or malicious payloads. The broad exception handling could hide errors but does not indicate malicious intent. Variable naming suggests some obfuscation but is not malicious. The primary security concern is data leakage through print statements and lack of input validation, which could be exploited in a larger system. No hardcoded secrets or network communications are present. The malware score is 0, as no malicious code or behavior is detected. The obfuscation score is around 0.4 due to variable naming complexity. The overall security risk is approximately 0.3, mainly from data exposure and error masking.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate node management utility with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The main security issues relate to data leakage and error handling practices. The assigned scores of malware = 0, obfuscated = 0.4, and risk = 0.3 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
