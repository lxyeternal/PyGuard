  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and the appropriateness of the assigned scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code manages a node hierarchy, allowing adding, deleting, and visualizing nodes with IP addresses. No external network activity, no cryptography, no hardcoded secrets, and no obfuscation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent with the analysis; no malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears straightforward, with no obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, justified by broad exception handling that could hide errors but no active security threat.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar node management functions, with user input for node IDs and IPs. No network activity or cryptography. The main concern is broad exception handling and lack of input validation.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — aligns with the analysis; no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code clarity is maintained.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — slightly higher, justified by potential input validation issues, but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Manages a node graph, with visualization and deletion. No malicious network activity or data exfiltration. Data leakage via print statements is possible but not malicious.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — matches the findings; no malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code is clear, despite some verbose print statements.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — justified; mainly due to lack of input validation and broad exception handling.\n\n**Verdict:** No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Handles hierarchical nodes, with user interaction and visualization. Obfuscated variable names and extensive try-except blocks. No malicious activity, but data exposure through print statements.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — consistent; no malware.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.4 — variable and function names look intentionally complex, which may suggest obfuscation.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — acceptable, given no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** The obfuscation score might be slightly increased to reflect the variable naming, but 0.4 is reasonable. Overall, scores are acceptable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar node management with data exposure via print statements. No malware or backdoors. The main concern is data leakage.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — appropriate.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — code appears straightforward.\n\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — justified due to data leakage potential and lack of input validation.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Mostly 0, with report 4 at 0.4, which is reasonable considering the variable naming and code complexity.\n\n- **Risk scores:** Slight variations (0.2 to 0.3) are justified based on broad exception handling and data exposure but do not indicate active threats.\n\n---\n\n### Final Personal Estimation:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — consistent across all reports; no malware detected.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 — considering some variable naming complexity, but overall code is not heavily obfuscated.\n\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — primarily due to error handling and data exposure, but no active security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No significant revisions are necessary.",
