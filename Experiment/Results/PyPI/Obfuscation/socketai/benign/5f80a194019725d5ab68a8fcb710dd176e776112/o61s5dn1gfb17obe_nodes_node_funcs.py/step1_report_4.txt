{
  "purpose": "The code appears to manage a node-based structure, allowing adding, deleting, and visualizing nodes with associated data such as IDs and IP addresses.",
  "sources": "User inputs for node IDs, parent node IDs, IP addresses, and deletion confirmations; data read from node objects and their attributes.",
  "sinks": "Input data used in node lookups, modifications, and deletions; printing output which could reveal sensitive node data; modification of node structures.",
  "flows": "User inputs are used to identify nodes (sources) and then influence node deletion, addition, or visualization (sinks), with flows through functions that process node attributes and structures.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of complex, obfuscated-looking function and variable names; extensive try-except blocks hiding potential errors; printing of internal node structures and relationships, which could leak internal info.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily relies on user input for node IDs and IP addresses, with checks for node existence and unique IP addresses. Node deletion involves recursive gathering of child nodes for removal, which is typical for hierarchical data management. The visualization function prints node relationships with detailed ASCII art, which may expose internal structure. No evidence of hardcoded credentials or network communication outside of local data processing. The obfuscated function names and variables suggest intentional concealment or code complexity, but no malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication to external servers are evident. The code does not perform unsafe SQL operations or generate insecure random numbers. The try-except blocks could be used to hide errors, but no malicious exception handling is apparent. Overall, the code appears to be a management interface for node structures with no clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code manages node structures with user interaction and visualization; it does not exhibit malicious behavior or malicious intent based on static analysis. Obfuscation and extensive error handling are noted but do not indicate malicious activity. No evidence of malware or security risks was found.",
