  "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates that the code is benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The potential risks stem from common practices like network communication and environment variable usage, which are typical in legitimate scripts. Scores are appropriately low, with minor caution due to the presence of subprocess or dynamic execution elements. No adjustments are necessary; continued monitoring during runtime is recommended to detect any dynamic malicious behaviors."
