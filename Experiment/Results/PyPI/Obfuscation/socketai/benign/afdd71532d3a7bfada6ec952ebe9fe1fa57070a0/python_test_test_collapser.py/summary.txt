  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate graph processing script with significant obfuscation and external dependencies. There is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the trustworthiness of external functions, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants cautious review of external modules. Malware score: 0.0, Obfuscated score: 0.75, Security risk: 0.2."
