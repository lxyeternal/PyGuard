  "purpose": "Module initialization and export setup with obfuscated internal symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.python and ._version).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no external communication or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "Import statements load symbols into the namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical symbol names (e.g., OXRunvgkesCZnpepoWfVKPjSccCirBgi, NSfcJKxDGfiBLDJtHJixJBSoYcuApgdo).",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements and a __all__ list. The imported symbols have obfuscated names, which could be auto-generated or intentionally concealed. No malicious code, network activity, or data handling is evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0 or 0.1, obfuscation: 0.4-0.7, risk: 0.2) are consistent with the observed minimal activity and obfuscated identifiers. Further review of the actual imported modules is recommended to confirm their purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package initialization with obfuscated internal symbols. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security threats in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants cautious review, but based solely on this snippet, the security risk remains low.",
