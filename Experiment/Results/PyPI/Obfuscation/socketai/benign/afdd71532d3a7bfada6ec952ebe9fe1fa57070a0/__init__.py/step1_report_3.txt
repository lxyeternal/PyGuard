  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package's __init__.py file, setting up exports for the package modules and version information.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .python and ._version",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communication",
  "flows": "Imports source data from local modules, then exposes certain functions or variables via __all__",
  "anomalies": "Imported names 'OXRunvgkesCZnpepoWfVKPjSccCirBgi' and 'NSfcJKxDGfiBLDJtHJixJBSoYcuApgdo' are obfuscated or nonsensical, suggesting possible obfuscation or code hiding; no other suspicious activity is evident",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package initialization by importing specific elements from internal modules and defining the public interface. The imported identifiers are either obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be a red flag for code concealment or malicious intent, but on their own, these are not inherently malicious. No external network activity, credential handling, or other malicious patterns are present. The code is minimal and typical for a Python package's __init__.py file.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely a normal package initializer with obfuscated internal identifiers. No clear malicious behavior or security risks are detected. The obfuscated import names warrant further review of the actual imported modules for potential hidden code, but based on this snippet alone, there are no signs of malware or security issues.",
