The obfuscation warrants cautious review, but based solely on this snippet, the security risk remains low."

      "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears benign aside from the suspicious obfuscated import name. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risk. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware likelihood remains at zero. Further review of the imported object and its source is advised to confirm safety."

Obfuscation is likely for complexity or concealment, but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the security risk is low (~0.2)."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate graph processing script with significant obfuscation and external dependencies. There is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the trustworthiness of external functions, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the code appears benign but warrants cautious review of external modules. Malware score: 0.0, Obfuscated score: 0.75, Security risk: 0.2."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The overall evaluation indicates that the code is benign with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The potential risks stem from common practices like network communication and environment variable usage, which are typical in legitimate scripts. Scores are appropriately low, with minor caution due to the presence of subprocess or dynamic execution elements. No adjustments are necessary; continued monitoring during runtime is recommended to detect any dynamic malicious behaviors."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the overall security risk very low (~0.1-0.2)."
