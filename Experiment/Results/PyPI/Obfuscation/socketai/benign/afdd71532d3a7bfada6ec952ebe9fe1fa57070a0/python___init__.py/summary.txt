  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears benign aside from the suspicious obfuscated import name. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risk. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware likelihood remains at zero. Further review of the imported object and its source is advised to confirm safety."
