  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured testing suite for a scientific library (ripser). It contains no malicious intent, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and the overall security risk very low (~0.1-0.2)."
