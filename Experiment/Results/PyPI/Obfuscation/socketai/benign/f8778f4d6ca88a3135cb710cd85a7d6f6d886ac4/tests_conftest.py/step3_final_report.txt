  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, environment variables, network communication, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, dynamic code execution points, environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Input reading (e.g., environment variables) → data processing or network communication → potential malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, but reports mention potential dynamic evaluation, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code; no actual code provided for review.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly recognize the absence of code and assign zero scores for malware and obfuscation. Report 4 discusses some code behavior but finds no suspicious patterns, leading to a malware score of 0 and a low security risk score of 0.2, which is reasonable given the context. Confidence scores should be lower (around 0.1-0.3) when no code is present, but some reports have higher confidence based on assumptions. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the lack of concrete code evidence. No significant anomalies or malicious indicators are identified in the available information.",
  "conclusion": "The current reports are appropriate and conservative, correctly assigning zero malware and obfuscation scores. Risk scores are low, reflecting the absence of suspicious activity. Confidence levels should be adjusted downward in cases lacking actual code review. Overall, the security posture appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation.",
