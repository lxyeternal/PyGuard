  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific task, but without seeing the actual code, it is unclear what it is. It might be for data processing, communication, or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources may include user input, environment variables, or external data files. Specific sources cannot be identified without actual code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could involve network connections, file writing, system calls, or execution of code. Details are not available without the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows would typically originate from sources and pass through processing functions before reaching sinks. Specific flows cannot be determined without the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the code. No hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or suspicious behavior is evident without the code content.",
  "analysis": "Insufficient information to perform a detailed analysis. The code snippet is absent, preventing source, sink, flow, or anomaly identification. As a result, I cannot evaluate security risks or malware potential precisely.",
  "conclusion": "Unable to analyze the code due to lack of actual source code content. Cannot confirm malicious behavior or security issues without the code.",
