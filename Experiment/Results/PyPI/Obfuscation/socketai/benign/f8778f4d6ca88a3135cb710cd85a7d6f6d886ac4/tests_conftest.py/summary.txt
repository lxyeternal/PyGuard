  "conclusion": "The current reports are appropriate and conservative, correctly assigning zero malware and obfuscation scores. Risk scores are low, reflecting the absence of suspicious activity. Confidence levels should be adjusted downward in cases lacking actual code review. Overall, the security posture appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation."
