  "purpose": "A setup script for a Python package that reads dependencies from 'src/requirements.txt' using an obfuscated function.",
  "sources": "Reads 'src/requirements.txt' file within an obfuscated function.",
  "sinks": "Passes dependencies to 'install_requires' in setup(), no other data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Function reads file content -> returns list of dependencies -> passed to setup() as 'install_requires'.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; no validation or sanitization of file content; no network activity or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard package setup with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, network activity, or data leaks are detected. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The malware score remains at 0, as no malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), reflecting suspicion due to naming. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), consistent with benign setup code. The obfuscation may be intended to evade static analysis but does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities is present. Obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. Scores should reflect benign intent: malware=0, obfuscated=0.6, risk=0.2.",
