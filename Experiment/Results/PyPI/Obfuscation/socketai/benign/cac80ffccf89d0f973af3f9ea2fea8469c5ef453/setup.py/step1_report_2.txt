  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration and load dependencies from a requirements file",
  "sources": "Reading the 'src/requirements.txt' file in the function XxiNXmZmBmIZcpQBiMAGWMyVhUQMYkHk",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; standard setup functions do not process untrusted data",
  "flows": "Function reads file content and returns list of dependencies, which are then used by setup()",
  "anomalies": "Function name is obfuscated; no validation or sanitization of file contents; the code is mostly standard but the obfuscated function name raises suspicion",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools for package configuration. It defines an obfuscated function to read dependencies from a file. The setup() call uses this function to load dependencies. The function name is intentionally obscure, which is suspicious. The content itself reads a static file; there are no external inputs or network operations. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior is apparent. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or to evade detection, but based solely on this snippet, it appears to be a normal setup script with obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup configuration with an obfuscated function name. No malicious activity or malicious code behavior is evident from this snippet. The obfuscation is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. Overall, the code appears safe but warrants caution due to the obfuscation.",
