  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Flask JSON response wrapper with obfuscated naming. No evidence of malicious behavior or vulnerabilities is present. The main concern is the external encoder's trustworthiness. The assigned scores are appropriate; I recommend maintaining or slightly increasing the obfuscation score due to naming obscurity. Overall, the code appears safe but warrants review of the external encoder before deployment."
