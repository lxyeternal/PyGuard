  "purpose": "Custom Flask response class that serializes data to JSON format using a specific encoder",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'IOijwqdaHDVMZlNsPubiOIncJXpxrvis' passed to dumps() for JSON serialization",
  "sinks": "Dumps function serializes data; Response object outputs HTTP response",
  "flows": "Input data -> dumps() -> Response object",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom JSON encoder, but no suspicious or malicious behavior detected; no hardcoded secrets or external calls",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of Flask Response, which serializes input data into JSON using a custom encoder class. It appears to be a straightforward implementation intended for returning JSON responses with specified status codes. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or backdoors are present. The code leverages standard libraries and a custom encoder, which is not inherently suspicious. The code structure is simple and does not include any obfuscated or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical implementation of a Flask response subclass for JSON serialization, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
