  "purpose": "Custom Flask response class that serializes input data to JSON and returns it as plain text response",
  "sources": "Input data passed to the constructor parameter IOijwqdaHDVMZlNsPubiOIncJXpxrvis",
  "sinks": "Dumps data using json.dumps and responds with a Flask Response object",
  "flows": "Input data -> json.dumps with custom encoder -> Response object with mimetype 'text/plain'",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated class name, but no obvious malicious code; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic detected",
  "analysis": "The class extends Flask's Response to serialize data using a custom JSON encoder and sends it as plain text. No external input is directly executed or transmitted over the network. The code appears to be a straightforward wrapper around JSON serialization. No signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom response wrapper for JSON data in Flask. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated class name is unusual but not inherently malicious.",
