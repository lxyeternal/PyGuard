  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules related to API JSON and message responses",
  "sources": "Import statements importing obfuscated class or function names from local modules",
  "sinks": "Potentially none directly, as import statements themselves are not inherently sinks; concern arises if imported items are used maliciously later",
  "flows": "Imported obfuscated identifiers could be used downstream in the application, but no direct data flow is observable from this snippet alone",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated names for imported entities; no descriptive identifiers; no visible code logic or data handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code imports two components with obfuscated names from local modules, which might suggest concealment. Without further code, there are no clear source-to-sink flows or malicious activities. The obfuscation might be legitimate or could hide malicious intent, but no concrete malicious behavior can be inferred solely from these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of simple import statements with obfuscated identifiers. On their own, they do not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. However, the obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules and subsequent usage to confirm safety.",
