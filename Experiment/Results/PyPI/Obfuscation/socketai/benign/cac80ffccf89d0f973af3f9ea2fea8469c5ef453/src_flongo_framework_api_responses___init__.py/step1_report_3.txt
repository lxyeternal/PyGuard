  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules for further use in the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .api_json_response and .api_message_response.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or external communication shown.",
  "flows": "N/A, only import statements; no data flow, input, or output operations.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names 'wdRcvfmyAAgsvqzAzzrBFWotrHjOMbRg' and 'PtlIQvNzjAlszrOYeuONkPPFcKBKtFKn' are obfuscated, suggesting possible code hiding or attempt to conceal functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code contains two import statements importing obfuscated names from local modules. The obfuscated identifiers could be benign, but their unusual nature raises suspicion of concealment. No other logic or data handling present. The lack of context makes it difficult to assess intent fully, but obfuscation alone is a potential indicator of malicious hiding. No external data sources or network communication is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code's simplicity and the use of obfuscated import names raise suspicion of possible concealment or malicious intent, but no concrete malicious activity can be confirmed based solely on these import statements. It warrants further review of the imported modules for malicious behavior.",
