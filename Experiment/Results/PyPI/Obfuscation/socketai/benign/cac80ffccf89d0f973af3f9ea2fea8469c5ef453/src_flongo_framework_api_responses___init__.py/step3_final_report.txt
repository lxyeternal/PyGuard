  "purpose": "Import obfuscated modules from local files, likely to conceal functionality or intent.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from local modules: '.api_json_response' and '.api_message_response'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or external data movement observed; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated, non-descriptive identifiers in import statements; absence of any other code or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements importing obfuscated identifiers from local modules. The identifiers are intentionally non-descriptive, which raises suspicion of obfuscation. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is visible. The low malware scores (around 0.2) are justified due to lack of evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores (~0.7) reflect suspicion but are not definitive proof of malicious intent. The overall security risk remains low (~0.2-0.3), primarily due to obfuscation concerns. The scores across reports are consistent and cautious, emphasizing that obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious activity but warrants further review of the imported modules and their contents.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign in isolation but suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or data leaks. The current scores are appropriate, highlighting obfuscation as a red flag that should prompt further investigation into the imported modules. No immediate threat is confirmed based solely on this code fragment.",
