  "purpose": "Import modules or functions from local files for further use in the application.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .api_json_response and .api_message_response",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external outputs observed in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from sources to sinks in the provided code",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers 'wdRcvfmyAAgsvqzAzzrBFWotrHjOMbRg' and 'PtlIQvNzjAlszrOYeuONkPPFcKBKtFKn' appear to be random or obfuscated names, suggesting potential code obfuscation or intentional hiding",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with identifiers that appear as random or obfuscated strings, which could indicate attempts to hide the purpose of the code. There are no explicit data flows, function calls, or suspicious behaviors shown. The imports are from local modules, and no external network activity or malicious behavior is evident from these lines alone.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet contains only import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which could be benign or an attempt at obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risks in this limited fragment, but the obfuscated naming warrants cautious review of the entire codebase.",
