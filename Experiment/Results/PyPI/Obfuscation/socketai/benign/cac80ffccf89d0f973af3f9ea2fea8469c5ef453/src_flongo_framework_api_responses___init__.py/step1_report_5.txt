  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules related to API responses.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading from local modules './api_json_response' and './api_message_response'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or external communications within the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only import statements; no runtime data flows are established here.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers 'wdRcvfmyAAgsvqzAzzrBFWotrHjOMbRg' and 'PtlIQvNzjAlszrOYeuONkPPFcKBKtFKn' are highly obfuscated, which may be an attempt to conceal their purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements importing obfuscated identifiers from local modules. There are no runtime behaviors, data handling, or network activities visible. The obfuscation of identifiers suggests an attempt to hide the true nature of the imported components. Without additional context or usage, it is not possible to determine if these are malicious, but obfuscated names can be suspicious and warrant further review.",
  "conclusion": "The code only performs obfuscated import statements without any apparent malicious behavior. However, the obfuscation raises concerns and suggests the need for further investigation into the imported components. Based solely on this snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
