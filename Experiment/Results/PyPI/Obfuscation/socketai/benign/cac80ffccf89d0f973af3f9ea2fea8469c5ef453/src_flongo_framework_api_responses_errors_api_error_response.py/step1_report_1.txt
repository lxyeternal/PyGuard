{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom error class that extends an imported API error, initializing with data, status code, and optional message.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to the class constructor (IOijwqdaHDVMZlNsPubiOIncJXpxrvis).",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network communication, file access, or environment variable usage.",
  "flows": "Input data is wrapped in a dictionary if not already, then passed to a method HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq with other parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide the code's purpose. The class inherits from an imported error class. The method HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq is called but undefined here, which could be legitimate or suspicious depending on its implementation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class that extends an imported error class. It initializes with some input data, wrapping non-dict inputs into a dict with a generic key 'data'. It then calls a method with the data and other parameters. The obfuscated variable names and method name suggest an attempt to hide the code's true purpose. There are no network operations, file access, or environment variable manipulations visible. The code appears to be a straightforward class constructor with obfuscated identifiers, likely to hinder analysis. No direct malicious behavior is evident from this snippet. However, the obfuscation could be an indicator of malicious intent if used within a broader malicious context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated, but structurally appears to define a custom error class with standard data handling. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious payloads in this isolated snippet. The obfuscation suggests caution, but not necessarily malicious intent based solely on this code.",
