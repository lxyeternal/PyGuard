  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that extends a specific error class, with flexible input handling.",
  "sources": "Input parameter IOijwqdaHDVMZlNsPubiOIncJXpxrvis passed to __init__, possibly from external sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of the input data in the method HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq, which may process or output the data.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from IOijwqdaHDVMZlNsPubiOIncJXpxrvis through a type check and is then passed into HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq, possibly affecting internal or external operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated class and method names; the class extends a dynamically imported error class; input data is forcibly wrapped into a dict if not already, which is standard but combined with obfuscated names raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception class with non-descriptive, obfuscated naming, likely to conceal intent. It imports a class from a relative path, which could be legitimate or suspicious depending on context. The constructor checks if the input is a dict; if not, it wraps it, a normal pattern for flexible data handling. The constructor then calls a method with the data and other parameters. The obfuscation of names and lack of explicit malicious operations suggest this is designed to obscure the code’s purpose. There are no network connections, data exfiltration, or system modification code visible. Without more context, the code appears as a standard custom exception wrapper with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated class definition for custom exception handling, with no direct evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply to deter reverse engineering. Based on current analysis, it does not demonstrate malicious behavior but warrants caution due to the obfuscation.",
