  "purpose": "A class extending an imported error class, wrapping input data into a dictionary if necessary, and calling an internal method with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'IOijwqdaHDVMZlNsPubiOIncJXpxrvis', which may be any data; the method 'HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq' called with processed data.",
  "sinks": "The method 'HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq' potentially processes data; without its implementation, the sink's behavior is unknown.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from the constructor parameter into a dictionary (if needed), then into the method call 'HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq'.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class, variable, and method names; relative import with multiple dots; undefined method 'HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq'.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from an imported error class, obfuscated to conceal its purpose. It wraps input data into a dict if not already one, then calls an external method. No network, file, or environment operations are visible. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity. The method called is undefined here, which could be benign or malicious depending on its implementation. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, high obfuscation, low risk) are consistent with this analysis. The code appears to be a standard error wrapper with obfuscation, warranting caution but no definitive malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but does not show evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this isolated snippet. The high obfuscation suggests caution, but without further context or the implementation of the called method, it is deemed benign. The scores of malware=0 and low security risk are appropriate; the high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in understanding the code's intent.",
