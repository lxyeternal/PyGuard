  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but functionally appears to be a custom exception class with no malicious behavior. The unusual super() call and obfuscated identifiers suggest possible obfuscation or code hiding but do not demonstrate malicious intent. Scores reflect high obfuscation, low malware risk, and moderate security concern primarily due to obfuscation. Further analysis of the full codebase is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, the security risk remains low."
