  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that inherits from an imported error class, with customizable message, optional details, and status code.",
  "sources": "Import statement for error class; class constructor parameters for message, details, status code, and optional string.",
  "sinks": "super() call passing the message; potentially calling a method HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq that may have side effects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (message, details, status code, optional string) flow into the super() call and the method HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and variable names that are nonsensical; method HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq appears to be dynamically named or obfuscated; the code appears deliberately obfuscated or auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from a custom error class imported from a relative module. The constructor takes a message, optional details, status code, and optional string. It calls super() with the message and then invokes a method with a similarly obfuscated name, passing all parameters. The class and method names are intentionally obfuscated, which can be a sign of hiding malicious intent or code obfuscation. There are no clear data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications. The import and method calls seem to serve standard exception handling purposes but are masked by obfuscated identifiers. The overall structure is suspicious but does not directly indicate malicious behavior based solely on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated custom exception class definition, which may be an attempt to conceal its purpose. It does not contain explicit malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system modification. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive proof of malicious intent.",
