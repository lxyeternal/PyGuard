  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that inherits from an imported error class, with additional parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statement for EmYiZieOMhYGmzodTDBZxXboeiFrxGqz, constructor parameters, and class inheritance.",
  "sinks": "Super class initialization, potential for propagating errors or exceptions, no external data sinks observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization parameters flow into the super() call and attribute assignments, no external data flow or network interaction.",
  "anomalies": "Class and variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, no meaningful identifiers; constructor calls super with 'Exception' instead of the superclass, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an exception subclass with obfuscated class and variable names. It imports an error class and extends it, passing parameters to a method that appears to initialize the base class. The use of obfuscated names and unusual super() invocation suggest code obfuscation, but not necessarily malicious intent. There is no evidence of data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior; the code appears to be a straightforward exception class with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but structurally a simple custom exception class. No malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation may be an attempt to hide purpose or behavior, but there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
