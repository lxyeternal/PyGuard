  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with heavily obfuscated identifiers, inheriting from an imported error class, likely for error handling or internal use.",
  "sources": "Input parameters in constructor (message, optional dict, status code, optional string); import statement for error class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks such as network, file, or external data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Constructor receives input, calls super() with 'Exception', then invokes obfuscated method with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class, method, and variable names; unconventional super() call with 'Exception'; relative import path; obfuscated method invocation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated custom exception class inheriting from an imported error class. The constructor's super() call with 'Exception' is unconventional and possibly a mistake or obfuscation tactic. The obfuscated method likely performs internal setup. No network activity, data leakage, or malicious behavior is evident. The heavy obfuscation and unusual inheritance call raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The malware score is low (0), obfuscation high (~0.8), and security risk moderate (~0.3). The code appears to be a custom exception, possibly auto-generated or intentionally obscured, with no concrete evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but functionally appears to be a custom exception class with no malicious behavior. The unusual super() call and obfuscated identifiers suggest possible obfuscation or code hiding but do not demonstrate malicious intent. Scores reflect high obfuscation, low malware risk, and moderate security concern primarily due to obfuscation. Further analysis of the full codebase is recommended, but based solely on this snippet, the security risk remains low.",
