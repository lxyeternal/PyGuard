  "sinks": "super() constructor call; potential data flow into the parent class's __init__ method.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of the custom exception class leads to calling the parent class's __init__ method with the message.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated class and variable names; the class inherits from a dynamically imported, obscure error class; constructor calls 'super()' with 'Exception' rather than the parent class, which is unusual and potentially a mistake or deliberate obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with an obfuscated name inheriting from an imported class with an obscure name, likely an error class. The constructor accepts parameters with obfuscated names, including a message string, optional dict, status code, and optional string. It then calls 'super()' with 'Exception' instead of the parent class, which could indicate incorrect inheritance behavior or an attempt at obfuscation. There are no evident malicious actions such as network calls, data leaks, or backdoors. The heavy obfuscation and unusual 'super()' call suggest an intent to obscure code behavior, but nothing directly malicious is observable from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated with no clear malicious intent. It defines a custom exception class with unusual naming and inheritance patterns, which could be used to hide malicious behavior, but no such behavior is evident here. The main concern is obfuscation rather than malicious functionality.",
