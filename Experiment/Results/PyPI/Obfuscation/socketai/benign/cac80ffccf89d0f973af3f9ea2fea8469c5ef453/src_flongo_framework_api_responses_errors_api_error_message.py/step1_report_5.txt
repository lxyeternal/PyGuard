{
  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class that extends a base error class, likely for error handling in an API response context.",
  "sources": "Import statement for a class from an external module; constructor parameters for error message, optional details, status code, and optional string.",
  "sinks": "super() call that initializes the base exception class with the error message; no other data flows or output sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (error message, optional dict, status code, optional string) flow into the superclass constructor via the self.HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq method, which appears to initialize the exception.",
  "anomalies": "The class and variable names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which can be suspicious but may also be intentional obfuscation; no hardcoded secrets or malicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated class and defines another class with obfuscated naming conventions. The constructor accepts parameters typical for error handling (message, details, status code, optional string). It calls super() with a hardcoded Exception class rather than the class it extends, which is unusual and could be a mistake or intentional obfuscation. The method HXiLyhxxQpbXtsOjjUOXCEABWTIiYSEq appears to be a method of the parent class or defined elsewhere, but its behavior cannot be determined from this snippet. The overall structure resembles a custom exception class but with obfuscated names and unclear inheritance behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated custom exception class that inherits from another class, possibly to integrate with an API error handling system. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors. The obfuscation might be suspicious but can also be a form of code hiding or protection. The code does not perform any malicious actions on its own.",
