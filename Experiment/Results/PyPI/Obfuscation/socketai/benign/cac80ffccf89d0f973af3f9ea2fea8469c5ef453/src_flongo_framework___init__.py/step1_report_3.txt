  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific function, potentially related to data processing or network communication, but the exact purpose cannot be determined without analyzing the actual code content.",
  "sources": "Input sources include reading environment variables, files, network data, or user inputs; specific sources are unclear due to lack of code content provided.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include writing to files, network sockets, executing system commands, or modifying system state; exact sinks cannot be pinpointed without code details.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks through functions, possibly involving data manipulation, transmission, or storage; specifics are unknown due to missing code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without the actual code. Absence of code precludes detection of hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The review cannot proceed without the actual code. As no code was provided, a thorough step-by-step analysis is not possible. If code is supplied, the analysis should include examining input points, data processing paths, and output points for suspicious or malicious behavior, as well as any unusual coding patterns.",
  "conclusion": "No conclusions can be drawn without analyzing the code. Please provide the code snippet for a comprehensive review.",
