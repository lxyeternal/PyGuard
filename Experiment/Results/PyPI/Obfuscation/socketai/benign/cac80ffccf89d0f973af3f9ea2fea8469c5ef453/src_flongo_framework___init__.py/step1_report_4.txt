  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script with some imports and function definitions, potentially aimed at data processing or network operations.",
  "sources": "Reading data from input functions, environment variables, or external files (not explicitly shown in the snippet).",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations such as network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls (not explicitly visible).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment) to sinks (network, files, subprocesses), but specifics are not provided in the code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs identified in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and lacks complex logic or suspicious patterns. No malicious functions, backdoors, or covert data exfiltration mechanisms are apparent. Usage of third-party libraries appears legitimate. Without additional context or more code, no malicious or maliciously intended behavior can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malware or security concerns.",
