  "purpose": "To evaluate the supply chain security and malicious potential of the open source Python dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, configuration files, network connections, file operations, system commands, user input, environment variables, logs.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, system commands, environment variables, logs, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via data processing functions, network calls, or system interactions; no suspicious flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code patterns observed; incomplete code snippets limit full analysis but no malicious indicators found.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious patterns, backdoors, or obfuscation. Reports lacking code appropriately refrain from conclusions. The scores assigned (malware 0, obfuscated 0, risk 0.2-0.3) are consistent with the benign assessments. Confidence levels vary but are justified given the limited code context. No evidence suggests malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No adjustments are necessary; the overall security posture is considered safe based on current information.",
