{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some data processing or computation task.",
  "sources": "Input data may be read from environment variables, files, or user input functions such as input(), open() calls, or external data sources like network requests.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if untrusted data is printed, written to files, sent over network connections, or stored insecurely. Sinks include print statements, network calls, file writes, or system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env variables) through processing functions and potentially to sinks (output, network, file). Any untrusted data that reaches sinks without validation could be a risk.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures. No obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or unusual variable naming detected. The code is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script reads input data via standard methods and processes it without evident malicious behavior. No network connections, no data exfiltration methods, and no suspicious system commands are present. The code structure is simple and clear, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. Given the lack of suspicious behaviors and the context, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided content. It appears to be a standard data processing script with no indications of sabotage or malicious intent.",
