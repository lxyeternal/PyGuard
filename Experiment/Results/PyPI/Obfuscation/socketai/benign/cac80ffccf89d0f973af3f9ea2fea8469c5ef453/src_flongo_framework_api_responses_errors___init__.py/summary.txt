  "conclusion": "The import statements are benign, with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity. Malware scores should be set to 0, obfuscation remains high, and risk scores are low. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to confirm they do not contain malicious code, but based solely on these statements, the code is safe."
