  "purpose": "Importing specific attributes from local modules related to API error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements that load attributes from modules within the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform I/O operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import statements are static and do not involve runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Imported attribute names appear to be random strings, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated, which is unusual for standard code and may indicate obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing attributes with seemingly random or obfuscated names from local modules. No functions, data processing, or network operations are present. The use of non-descriptive attribute names might be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate code, but with only these imports, no malicious behavior can be determined. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code actions are evident. The code appears minimal and possibly obfuscated, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code only imports obfuscated attribute names from local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscated attribute names could be a form of simple code hiding, but without additional context or code, the risk remains low.",
