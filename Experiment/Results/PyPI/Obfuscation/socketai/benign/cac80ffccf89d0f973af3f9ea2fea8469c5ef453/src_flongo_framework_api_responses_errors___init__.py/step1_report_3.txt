  "purpose": "Import obfuscated class or function names from local modules, likely for internal use.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from local modules: .api_error_message, .api_error_response, .api_error.",
  "sinks": "Not applicable; no data processing or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; simply importing symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names are highly obfuscated, consisting of random-looking strings, which is unusual and could be an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated symbol names. There are no other code structures, logic, or data handling visible. Obfuscated import names are suspicious, as they may hide malicious functions or data. However, without additional context or code, it's not possible to definitively identify malicious intent. The obfuscation could be malicious or simply an obscure naming convention.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains obfuscated import names, which is suspicious and warrants further investigation. No direct malicious activity or security risks are evident from these lines alone, but the obfuscation pattern is a concern. Additional code analysis is recommended.",
