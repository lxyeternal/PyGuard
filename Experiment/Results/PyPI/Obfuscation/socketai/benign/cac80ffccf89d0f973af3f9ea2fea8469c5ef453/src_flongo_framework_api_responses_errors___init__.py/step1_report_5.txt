  "purpose": "Import specific functions or variables from local modules related to API error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .api_error_message, .api_error_response, and .api_error.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are evident; code only imports symbols.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external or untrusted sources to sinks; imports are static and limited to symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are non-descriptive, seemingly random strings, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. However, as they are simply imported symbols, this alone is not suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three symbols with non-meaningful, seemingly obfuscated names from sibling modules. The code does not process or execute these symbols here. The use of such non-descriptive identifiers might be a red flag for obfuscation or malicious concealment, but with no additional context, these are just imports. There are no active data flows, no dynamic code execution, and no obvious malicious actions in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward import of symbols with obfuscated names from local modules. There is no immediate evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on these import statements. However, the use of non-descriptive names could indicate an attempt at obfuscation. Overall, this snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious activity.",
