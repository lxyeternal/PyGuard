  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules related to API error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements referencing internal modules: .api_error_message, .api_error_response, and .api_error.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only performs imports without processing untrusted data or executing sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply imports code components without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear to be random strings or obfuscated names, which could be an anomaly but might also be an artifact of code obfuscation or auto-generation. No other suspicious code or logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three import statements importing entities with non-descriptive, seemingly random or obfuscated names. There are no functions, data processing, or network operations. The imports are from local modules, suggesting they are part of a larger codebase. The identifiers do not provide clues about malicious intent but could indicate obfuscation or intentional hiding of functionality. No malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident from these import statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be standard import statements, possibly obfuscated, but without further context or functionality, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
