  "purpose": "Analyze import statements with obfuscated identifiers for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers from local modules.",
  "sinks": "No data flow, network activity, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - only import statements, no execution or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated or random-looking identifiers in import statements; no other code present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three import statements importing entities with obfuscated names. No functions, data processing, network activity, or code execution is evident. The obfuscated identifiers could be a result of code obfuscation or auto-generation. The absence of malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior suggests these imports are benign. The high obfuscation scores across reports are justified, but malware suspicion is unwarranted given the lack of evidence. Minor adjustments to malware scores (setting them to zero) are appropriate, especially in Report 3 where the score of 0.2 is slightly overstated. Overall, the code appears benign, with obfuscation being the primary concern, warranting further review of the imported modules but not immediate threat suspicion.",
  "conclusion": "The import statements are benign, with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity. Malware scores should be set to 0, obfuscation remains high, and risk scores are low. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to confirm they do not contain malicious code, but based solely on these statements, the code is safe.",
