  "purpose": "Importing specific attributes from local modules related to API error handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .api_error_message, .api_error_response, .api_error.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effects identified; no data processing or network activity present.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis applicable as the code only contains import statements; no untrusted data is read or written.",
  "anomalies": "Imported attribute names are nonsensical and appear to be random strings rather than meaningful identifiers; no typical naming conventions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing attributes with obfuscated, seemingly random names from local modules. No functions, data processing, or external calls are present. The import statements themselves do not execute code or perform malicious actions. The unusual attribute names suggest possible obfuscation or intentional concealment but do not inherently indicate malicious behavior. Without further context or code execution, these imports are benign but suspicious due to obfuscated naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only import statements with obfuscated attribute names, which by themselves do not demonstrate malicious intent. However, the unusual naming warrants caution and suggests the need for further review of the imported modules. There is no evidence of malware or security risks in this fragment alone.",
