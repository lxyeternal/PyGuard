  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant signs of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior, primarily through its unconventional import, obfuscated variable names, and dynamic invocation of a suspicious function. These patterns are indicative of malicious intent or backdoor functionality, especially during build or installation. The package should be treated as potentially dangerous until further analysis confirms its safety."
