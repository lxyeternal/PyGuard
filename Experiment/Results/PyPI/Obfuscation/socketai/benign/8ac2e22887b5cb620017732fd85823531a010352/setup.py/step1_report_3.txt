{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package named 'ff34c7oyt2w0ruk7' that depends on 'fnvhash' and includes package data.",
  "sources": "Reading package configuration data, hardcoded strings, import statements, and invoking a function from build_ext.",
  "sinks": "Calling function oXKeUzXjpuLPyskREHTkHMwVVWMNeGdX with the package metadata, potentially executing code.",
  "flows": "The code imports build_ext, then calls a function with package metadata as argument, and executes setup with package info.",
  "anomalies": "Use of an imported function 'oXKeUzXjpuLPyskREHTkHMwVVWMNeGdX' from build_ext and passing package data directly, which could be suspicious. Obfuscated variable names and unusual function invocation pattern. No visible validation or sanitization of data. The function name appears randomly generated, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs a package setup using setuptools, with variables holding package configuration details. The import from build_ext and the subsequent call to a function named 'oXKeUzXjpuLPyskREHTkHMwVVWMNeGdX' are unusual; the function name is obfuscated, which could indicate malicious intent such as code injection or executing hidden code. The script does not contain any explicit malicious commands, but the obfuscation and indirect function call pose a concern. No suspicious network activity or file operations are evident, but the obfuscated function call may be an attempt to execute malicious code during installation or build.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard setup file at first glance, but the use of an obfuscated function imported from build_ext and its invocation with package metadata is suspicious. This could be an attempt to hide malicious code or execute unintended actions during package installation. The overall risk is moderate, warranting further investigation into the source and behavior of 'build_ext' and the function 'oXKeUzXjpuLPyskREHTkHMwVVWMNeGdX'.",
