{
  "purpose": "Define a version string and import a specific class or function from a local module for hash function implementation.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string; import statement from a relative module",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or outputs present",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code mainly sets a version and imports",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'ZVINdZIttjsIYLAJeMjyehTmJyGReqOo' which appears random or obfuscated; import from a local module with a seemingly random name; no comments or documentation",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable name and imports a symbol from a local module with a similarly obfuscated name. There are no indications of malicious activity such as network activity, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code logic. The obfuscated variable and module names may suggest an attempt to hide functionality, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The import could be legitimate if the package is designed with such naming conventions. There are no other code constructs, data flows, or suspicious behaviors present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a larger module that uses obfuscated names but does not contain any evident malicious behavior or security risks. The use of random names may indicate attempts at concealment but does not constitute malicious activity based solely on this fragment.",
