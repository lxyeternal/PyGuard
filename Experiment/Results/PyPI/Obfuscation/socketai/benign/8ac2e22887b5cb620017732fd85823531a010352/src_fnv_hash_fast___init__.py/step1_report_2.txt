{
  "purpose": "Defines a version string and imports a specific function from a local module, exposing 'fnv1a_32' in the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string; import statement for 'LwaVfyNAeWMZJXlUGzNnUsHPJwkqlQYA' from local module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no data outputs or network activities are initiated.",
  "flows": "The code flows from variable assignment and import statements to the module's exported interface.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'ZVINdZIttjsIYLAJeMjyehTmJyGReqOo' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The imported name 'LwaVfyNAeWMZJXlUGzNnUsHPJwkqlQYA' is also obfuscated, which could be an anomaly or intentional obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet primarily sets a version string and imports a function from a local module. The variable and function names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could suggest an attempt to hide intent, but there is no active malicious behavior such as network connections, data manipulation, or code execution. The use of obfuscated identifiers without further context is not sufficient to declare malicious activity but warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module setup with obfuscated names, possibly for hiding implementation details. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The obfuscated identifiers might be intentional for privacy or security through obscurity, but they do not indicate malicious intent.",
