{
  "purpose": "Define a version string and import a specific implementation from a local module, then expose a function named 'fnv1a_32'.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string; import statement from local module 'fnv_impl'.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks that process untrusted data; no network or data output operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the import is static, and the version string is hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'ZVINdZIttjsIYLAJeMjyehTmJyGReqOo' is unusual and non-descriptive; the imported symbol 'LwaVfyNAeWMZJXlUGzNnUsHPJwkqlQYA' appears as a nonsensical string, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated. The code itself is minimal but the naming is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a obfuscated variable name, imports a presumably function or class with a similarly obfuscated name from a local module, and exposes 'fnv1a_32' in __all__. There are no active data processing, network operations, or typical malicious behaviors. The obfuscated variable and function names could be benign or an attempt to hide code complexity. No input sources or dangerous sinks are present, and no evidence of malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module with obfuscated variable and function names, with no malicious intent evident. It does not perform any harmful actions or contain suspicious behaviors based on this fragment alone.",
