  "purpose": "Minimal code assigning a version string and importing a hashing function, likely part of a hashing library.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string, import statement from local module",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "Version string assignment and import do not involve data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no malicious activity or suspicious behavior evident",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable and imports a symbol from a local module with an obfuscated name. No network activity, data leaks, or code execution are present. Obfuscation may be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious activity and note obfuscation. The malware scores are mostly zero, with some reports assigning 0.2 based on obfuscation, which is justified but can be slightly overstated in one case. The overall security risk is very low, reflecting the simplicity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation likely used for internal or concealment purposes. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscation score around 0.7, and risk score around 0.2, consistent with the analysis.",
