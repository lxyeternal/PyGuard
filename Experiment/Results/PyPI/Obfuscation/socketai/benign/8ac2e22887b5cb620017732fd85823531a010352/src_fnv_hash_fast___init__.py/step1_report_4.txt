  "purpose": "Define version and import a specific function from a local module, exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string; import statement importing 'LwaVfyNAeWMZJXlUGzNnUsHPJwkqlQYA' from a local module.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly, as no untrusted data handling, external communication, or sensitive data access occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; import occurs at module load, no further processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable name 'ZVINdZIttjsIYLAJeMjyehTmJyGReqOo'; the imported function name 'LwaVfyNAeWMZJXlUGzNnUsHPJwkqlQYA' appears obfuscated and non-descriptive, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string and imports a function with an obfuscated name from a local module. The variable and function names are intentionally obscured, which can be a sign of hiding malicious intent or obfuscation to evade detection. No external network connections, no handling of untrusted inputs, and no dangerous operations are present. The import is from a relative module, typical in package code, but the obfuscated naming raises suspicion about potential malicious intent or concealed functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears to be simple and not overtly malicious; however, the obfuscated variable and function names suggest an attempt to hide the true purpose of the code. Without additional context or the content of the imported module, the risk remains unclear, but there is a potential for obfuscation to conceal malicious behavior.",
