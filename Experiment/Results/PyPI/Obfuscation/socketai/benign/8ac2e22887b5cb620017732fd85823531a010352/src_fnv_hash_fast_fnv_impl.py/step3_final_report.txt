  "purpose": "Utility code for setting up an FNV-1a 32-bit hash function with optional optimized implementation fallback.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'fnvhash' module, conditional import of internal '_fnv_impl' module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; no data leaks or external system interactions observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization of hash parameters, partial application of hash function, fallback import override if available.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of dynamic import fallback, no direct malicious activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hashing utility with obfuscated variable names and conditional import for optimization. No malicious code, backdoors, or data leaks are present. Obfuscation is high but appears stylistic or for concealment rather than malicious intent. The fallback import pattern is common for performance enhancement. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility module for hashing, with obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate and should be maintained, reflecting low malware risk and moderate obfuscation.",
