{
  "purpose": "Define and assign a hashing function using FNV-1a hash algorithm, with fallback to an internal implementation if available.",
  "sources": "Import statements, type checking condition, partial function creation, and optional internal module import.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks where untrusted data flows or leads to potential harm; the code primarily defines functions.",
  "flows": "The code sets up a hashing function, potentially overriding it with an internal implementation, with no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic function creation, conditional import fallback, and obscure hashing setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard and third-party modules, defines a constant for hash size, and creates a partial hashing function with specified parameters. It employs obfuscated variable names, making intent less transparent. A conditional import attempts to override the hashing function with an internal implementation, which could be benign or malicious depending on context. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The obfuscation and conditional override warrant scrutiny but do not directly indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to set up a hashing utility with some obfuscation and fallback mechanisms. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system manipulation. The obfuscated variable names and conditional import are suspicious but not inherently malicious. Overall, the code seems to serve a legitimate purpose with some obfuscation, warranting a low to moderate security concern.",
