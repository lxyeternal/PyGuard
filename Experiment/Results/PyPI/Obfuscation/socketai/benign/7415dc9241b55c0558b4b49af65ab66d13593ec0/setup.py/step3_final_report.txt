{
  "purpose": "This code is a Python package setup script that configures package metadata and dependencies using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads the README.md file content and static parameters passed to setup(), with no external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or system effects; the script only defines package metadata.",
  "flows": "The script reads a local README file and passes static strings and booleans to the setup() function; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names are present, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no dynamic code execution, network activity, or code injection detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, performing benign package configuration tasks. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation is the only unusual aspect but does not imply malicious intent. The code does not process untrusted input, execute external commands, or contain hardcoded secrets. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the risk score is low, reflecting the benign nature of the script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's behavior. No modifications are necessary.",
