  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package related to heliophysics and space data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file from the package directory.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that process untrusted data or perform critical actions.",
  "flows": "Reads README.md -> uses data in setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, minimal comments, and unconventional parameter naming (e.g., ibIxnzpZVDpdJIZZFaPkuiecqRvFXhcB). The code primarily imports standard modules and executes a standard setup process without executing dynamic code or external commands.",
  "analysis": "The script imports pathlib for file handling and setuptools for packaging. It reads the README.md content and uses it as part of the package metadata. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but they only hold static data. The setup() call configures package metadata and dependencies without executing any suspicious or malicious actions. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. The code structure appears typical for a package setup, and no unusual behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely as a package setup script with obfuscated variable names, which is not inherently malicious. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide variable intent but does not indicate malicious activity.",
