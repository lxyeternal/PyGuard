  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class with two members using the Enum module.",
  "sources": "Importing the Enum class from the enum module.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Class and member names are obfuscated or nonsensical; no comments or documentation; the class contains only static string assignments. No dynamic code execution or external data access.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines a single enumeration class with two members. The class name and member names appear intentionally obfuscated or meaningless. There is no logic, data processing, or external interactions present. No secrets, credentials, or malicious behavior are evident. The purpose seems to be either obfuscation or placeholder code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward enumeration definition with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The unusual naming is likely for obfuscation or placeholder purposes.",
