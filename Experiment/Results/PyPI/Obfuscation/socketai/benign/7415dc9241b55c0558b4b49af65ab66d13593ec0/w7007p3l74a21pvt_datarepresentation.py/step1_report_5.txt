  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class with two members, possibly for configuration or labeling purposes.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and member names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which could be suspicious. The code does not perform any logic or I/O operations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class and defines a unique enumeration class with two members. The class name and member names appear deliberately obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be typical in malicious code trying to hide intent. However, the code itself is just a static class definition with string values and does not perform any malicious actions such as network activity, file operations, or data leakage. No signs of malware or security risks are present within this snippet. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious, but without additional context, it is not inherently harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition with obfuscated names, which alone does not indicate malicious intent. There are no obvious security risks or malicious behaviors. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not sufficient evidence of malicious activity.",
