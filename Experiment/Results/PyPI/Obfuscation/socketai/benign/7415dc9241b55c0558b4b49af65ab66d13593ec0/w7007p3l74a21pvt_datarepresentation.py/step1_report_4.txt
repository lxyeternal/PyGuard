{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class with specific string values, likely for internal code organization or constants.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output mechanisms are present that could leak data or be exploited.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted input or output.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and enum members are obfuscated or randomly generated, which may suggest attempts to conceal intent. No functional anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class, defines a unique enumeration with two members assigned specific string values. There are no data inputs, outputs, or function calls. The purpose appears to be creating a constant set of identifiers. The obfuscated class and member names could be suspicious, but they alone do not indicate malicious activity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation could be a red flag but is not necessarily malicious.",
