{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'pipeline_models', likely to be used elsewhere in the project.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is a source of data flow, bringing in external code dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this snippet; it does not execute untrusted data or perform sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "The import flow brings external module code into the current namespace, potentially enabling its functions and classes to be used later.",
  "anomalies": "Using 'import *' can obscure which functions or classes are being used, but this is common practice in some codebases and not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement that includes all contents from a local module 'pipeline_models'. No malicious behavior is evident here. The statement itself does not perform any operations, data leaks, or malicious actions. The lack of additional context limits the assessment, but based on this fragment alone, there is no indication of malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports a local module. No anomalies or malware indications are present.",
