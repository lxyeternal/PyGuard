  "purpose": "Import all components from the 'pipeline_models' module within the same package",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the local module 'pipeline_models' via relative import",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sources or sinks present in this line",
  "flows": "Not applicable; this line only performs an import operation",
  "anomalies": "Use of relative import alone is common; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement that pulls all symbols from 'pipeline_models' within the same package. It does not include any dynamic code execution, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious behavior. The use of a wildcard import (*) is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is not inherently malicious. No data flows, inputs, or outputs are visible in this line alone. No malware or security risks are evident from this single line.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It simply brings in modules from a local package.",
