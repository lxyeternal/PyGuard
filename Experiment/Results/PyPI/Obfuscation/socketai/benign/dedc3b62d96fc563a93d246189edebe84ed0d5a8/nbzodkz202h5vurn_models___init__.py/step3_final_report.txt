{
  "purpose": "The code performs a wildcard import from a local module 'pipeline_models', likely to bring in all functions, classes, or variables defined there for use in the current module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform any output or network operations.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows or source-to-sink paths; the import simply makes symbols available in the namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution and maintainability issues, but it is not inherently malicious or obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The primary concern is style and maintainability, not security. All reports correctly identify that there is no malicious activity, with malware scores set to 0. The risk scores are low (around 0.1-0.2), reflecting the style concern rather than a security threat. The code is clear, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The confidence in this assessment is high (above 0.8), given the simplicity of the code. No further analysis of 'pipeline_models' is possible from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main issue is the use of 'import *', which is a style concern but does not impact security. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. Unless the 'pipeline_models' module itself is compromised, there is no security risk.",
