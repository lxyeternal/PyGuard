{
  "purpose": "Imports all components from the 'pipeline_models' module within the same package",
  "sources": "The import statement itself is the data source, bringing in code from a local module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, external network, or sensitive data exposure observed",
  "flows": "Import statement loads module content into the current namespace; no data flows to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import (*) can be risky for namespace pollution and maintainability but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement importing all contents from a local module. No user input, environment variables, or external data sources are involved. No suspicious or malicious patterns are detected in this isolated statement. The wildcard import could potentially introduce unwanted or malicious code if the module itself is compromised, but based on this snippet alone, there's no indication of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import operation with no explicit malicious activity. The use of wildcard import is a potential maintainability concern but does not imply malicious intent. No malware or security risks are evident from this line alone.",
