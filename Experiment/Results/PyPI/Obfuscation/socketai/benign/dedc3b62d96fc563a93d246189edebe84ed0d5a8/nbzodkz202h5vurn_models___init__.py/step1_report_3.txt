  "purpose": "Import all components from the local module 'pipeline_models' to be used in the current script.",
  "sources": "The import statement, which loads code from the 'pipeline_models' module.",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported components later in the code; no direct sink present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported components are made available for use in the current module, but no specific data flow is visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement itself is standard; however, without context, the use of 'import *' can be risky as it obscures what is imported. No malicious code or suspicious patterns are evident from this single line.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement that brings in all definitions from a local module named 'pipeline_models'. There is no evidence of malicious behavior in this line. The use of 'import *' can be considered risky in larger codebases for obscurity, but it is not inherently malicious. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious intent, or security risks here. Since this is just an import, the actual behavior depends on the content of 'pipeline_models', which is not provided.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no indication of malicious behavior or security issues based solely on this snippet. The use of 'import *' warrants caution in general, but it does not suggest malicious activity.",
