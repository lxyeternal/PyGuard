  "purpose": "The code imports all components from the local module 'pipeline_models'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'pipeline_models' within the same package.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data are present in this line; it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident from this single import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a wildcard import (*) can be considered a bad practice but is not inherently malicious. No suspicious or unusual code constructs are present.",
  "analysis": "This code is a simple import statement that includes all symbols from 'pipeline_models' module located in the same package. It does not execute any untrusted data or perform network operations. The use of wildcard import could lead to namespace pollution but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no indications of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior. The only notable aspect is the use of wildcard import, which is a code style concern but not a security risk.",
