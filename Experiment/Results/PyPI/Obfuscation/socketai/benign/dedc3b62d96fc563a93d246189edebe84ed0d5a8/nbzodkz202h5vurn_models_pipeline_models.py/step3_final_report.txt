{
  "purpose": "The code defines a set of data classes representing structured data, with no executable logic or network activity.",
  "sources": "Class attribute initializations and type annotations; no external data sources or inputs are read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or data leaks; no data flows to external systems or network endpoints.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares data structures without processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "Class and attribute names are obfuscated and randomly generated, which can be suspicious but not malicious; pandas is imported but unused, indicating possible obfuscation or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of data class definitions with obscure naming, lacking any executable code, network activity, or malicious patterns. The obfuscation is notable but does not imply malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious data flows are present. The import of pandas is unused within these classes, which may suggest obfuscation or incomplete code. Overall, the code appears benign, serving as data containers without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign data structure definitions with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware is absent. The overall security risk remains low. No further action is necessary.",
