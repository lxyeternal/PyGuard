  "purpose": "Define data structures using dataclasses for handling specific structured data, possibly for further processing.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading mechanisms; only class definitions and type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no data processing, output, or external communication present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data handling observed; code purely declares data structures.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of dataclass definitions with type annotations, importing pandas for a pd.Series type. There are no functions, data input/output, or executable code that could perform malicious actions. No potential source-to-sink data flows are present. The code appears to be standard data modeling code with no signs of malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and appears to be a straightforward declaration of data classes used for structured data storage. There are no malicious behaviors, suspicious activities, or security risks detected.",
