{
  "purpose": "Define data structures using dataclasses for handling various types of data, possibly related to a data processing or analysis task.",
  "sources": "The code defines class attributes, which may serve as sources of data input when instances are created. No direct data input, file reading, or network calls are present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or output operations (like writing to files, databases, network transmission) are present within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The data flows from instantiation of these dataclasses, where data is assigned to attributes, but there are no explicit processing flows or untrusted data handling shown.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs. The code only defines data structures; it lacks any code that performs operations or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of dataclass definitions with type annotations. No functions, input/output operations, or logic are present. The attributes are straightforward and follow standard Python syntax. No indication of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors is evident. Without additional operational code, it is unlikely to perform any harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign, straightforward data structure definition with no signs of malicious activity. It appears to be part of a larger system where these classes are instantiated and used elsewhere. The code itself does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks.",
