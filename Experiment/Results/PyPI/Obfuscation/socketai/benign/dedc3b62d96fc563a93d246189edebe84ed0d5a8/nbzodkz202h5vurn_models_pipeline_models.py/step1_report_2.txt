{
  "purpose": "Defines several data classes for structured data handling, possibly for a data processing or analysis application.",
  "sources": "Imports from dataclasses, typing, and pandas; no external data input sources within the code itself.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted sources; the classes merely define data structures without processing logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. No obfuscated or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of data class definitions with various fields, including strings, optional strings, floats, and pandas Series. It appears to be part of a larger data handling framework. No external data input, network operations, or system modifications are present. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious activities. The code is clean, well-structured, and does not perform any operations or logic that could indicate malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as data structure definitions without any malicious intent or security concerns. It does not include any malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. It is safe and appears to be a standard component of a larger application.",
