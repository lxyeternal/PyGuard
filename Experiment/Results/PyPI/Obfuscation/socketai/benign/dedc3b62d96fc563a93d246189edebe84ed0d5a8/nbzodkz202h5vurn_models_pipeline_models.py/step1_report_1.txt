{
  "purpose": "The code defines several data classes for structured data storage, primarily for data processing tasks using pandas.",
  "sources": "No direct input or data reading sources are present in this code snippet.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent data sinks, output statements, or data leaks in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows since no input/output operations or untrusted data processing are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no suspicious hardcoded secrets, unusual constructs, or obfuscated code. Class names appear intentionally obscure but are not inherently malicious. No network or file operations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of data class definitions with no executable logic, input/output handling, or dynamic code execution. The class names and attribute names are seemingly arbitrary and do not suggest malicious intent or malicious behavior. No obfuscation or malware-like patterns are observed. The structure indicates purely data modeling, likely part of a larger application, with no indications of security risks, malicious activity, or supply chain sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only as data structure definitions without any suspicious or malicious elements. There are no indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security threats within this isolated code fragment.",
