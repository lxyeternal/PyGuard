      "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation. The main issue is the use of 'import *', which is a style concern but does not impact security. The reports are accurate, and the assigned scores are appropriate. Unless the 'pipeline_models' module itself is compromised, there is no security risk."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and standard, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious functions if present in 'PipelineProcessing'. The scores assigned are consistent with the minimal risk and lack of malicious activity, and no adjustments are necessary."

The obfuscation level is minor and does not impact security. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score is correctly set to 0. The code's purpose is clear, and it employs standard practices for data validation and file handling."
