  "flows": "Imports modules from the current package; no data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward import statements; no unusual language features or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "This code only performs two import statements from local modules. No data input, no dynamic code execution, and no embedded secrets. The simplicity and clarity suggest normal behavior. No signs of obfuscation, malicious activity, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import, with no indication of malicious intent or security issues. It appears safe based on this fragment.",
