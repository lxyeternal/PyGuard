{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules named 'models' and 'pipeline' from the current package directory, likely for use within a larger application or framework.",
  "sources": "Imports from the current package directory (relative imports of 'models' and 'pipeline')",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks; no external data handling or output occurs in this snippet",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow; just module imports, so no source-to-sink data flow is evident",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any suspicious or unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation; simple relative imports",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements for 'models' and 'pipeline'. This is a standard practice in Python packages for modular organization. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no data handling, network activity, or code execution beyond module importation. The simplicity suggests it's a part of a larger codebase, with no immediate security concerns visible here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing straightforward module imports with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
