  "purpose": "The code imports modules named 'models' and 'pipeline' from the current package, likely for use within a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from the current package (__init__ or module imports), which do not involve external data input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code simply performs imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains two import statements from relative modules within the same package. It does not execute any logic, handle inputs, or produce outputs. The structure appears standard for Python package modules. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscated code, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a basic import statement used to organize code within a package. There are no malicious elements or security concerns based on this content.",
