  "purpose": "Simple relative import statements for 'models' and 'pipeline' modules within the same package.",
  "sources": "Import statements: 'from . import models' and 'from . import pipeline'.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling, network activity, or external data usage.",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow beyond module imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward and standard for Python packages.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of relative import statements for internal modules, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The code does not perform any data processing, network communication, or dynamic execution. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero. Confidence levels are high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No suspicious patterns, secrets, or anomalies are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious intent or security risks. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the code content. No adjustments are necessary.",
