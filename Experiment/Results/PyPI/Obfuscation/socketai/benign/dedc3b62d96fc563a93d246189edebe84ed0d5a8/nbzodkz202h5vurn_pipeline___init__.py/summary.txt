  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and standard, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious functions if present in 'PipelineProcessing'. The scores assigned are consistent with the minimal risk and lack of malicious activity, and no adjustments are necessary."
