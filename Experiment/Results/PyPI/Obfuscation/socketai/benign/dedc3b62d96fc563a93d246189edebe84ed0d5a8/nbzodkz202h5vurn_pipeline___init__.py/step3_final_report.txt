{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from the local module 'PipelineProcessing' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from the 'PipelineProcessing' module in the same package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; the code only imports symbols, so no data leaks or effects occur here.",
  "flows": "The import brings all symbols from 'PipelineProcessing' into the current namespace; actual data flow depends on subsequent code in the module.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') which can obscure imported symbols and potentially hide malicious functions, but no malicious code is evident in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward relative import statement with no executable logic. Wildcard imports are discouraged due to namespace pollution and potential security risks, but they are not inherently malicious. The actual security implications depend on the contents of 'PipelineProcessing', which are unknown here. The reports correctly identify the risks associated with 'import *' but find no evidence of malicious activity. Malware scores are appropriately zero; risk scores are low, reflecting cautious acknowledgment of the import practice. No obfuscation is present. Overall, the code appears benign, with the main concern being the import style, which warrants review of the imported module for safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign and standard, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of 'import *', which can hide malicious functions if present in 'PipelineProcessing'. The scores assigned are consistent with the minimal risk and lack of malicious activity, and no adjustments are necessary.",
