{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'PipelineProcessing' within the same package, likely to use its functions or classes for processing data in a larger application.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'PipelineProcessing' module from the local package directory.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only an import statement without execution or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a wildcard import ('*'), which can obscure which functions or classes are imported, but this is common and not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a wildcard import from a local module, which by itself is not suspicious. It does not perform any operations, data handling, or network activity. There are no indications of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. Given the minimal code snippet, there are no anomalies or signs of obfuscation. This pattern is typical in Python projects for importing module contents but can sometimes be associated with unclear code management. No malicious intent is detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign import statement with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply imports code from a local module, which is a common practice.",
