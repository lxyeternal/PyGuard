  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local module 'PipelineProcessing'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from the local module 'PipelineProcessing'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only an import statement present.",
  "anomalies": "The use of 'from .Module import *' can be considered risky as it imports all symbols into the namespace, which can hide malicious or unintended code behaviors. However, the code itself does not contain malicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement using relative import syntax. It does not execute any logic or data processing. Importing all symbols from a module can be problematic if the module contains malicious code or undesired functions, but the snippet alone does not reveal such behavior. No other suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The use of 'import *' can be risky in larger contexts but does not indicate malicious intent here.",
