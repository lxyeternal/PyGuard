{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the module 'PipelineProcessing' in the same package, likely for processing data or managing workflows.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing code from 'PipelineProcessing' module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no data flow or output actions observed",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink flow; only an import statement without execution logic",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import ('*') can hide malicious or unintended code; no additional code present to analyze",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of an import statement with a wildcard. This practice can obscure what is being imported, potentially hiding malicious or unwanted code. However, without the content of 'PipelineProcessing', it is not possible to determine if malicious behavior exists. The snippet itself does not contain executable logic or suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is minimal and standard, but the use of wildcard import warrants caution. No explicit malicious activity detected from this fragment alone, but the overall security depends on the contents of 'PipelineProcessing'.",
