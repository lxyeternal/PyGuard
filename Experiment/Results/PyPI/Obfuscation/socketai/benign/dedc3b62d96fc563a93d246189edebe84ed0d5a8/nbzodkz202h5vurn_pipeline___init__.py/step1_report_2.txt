  "purpose": "Import all classes, functions, or variables from the local module 'PipelineProcessing'.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from the local module 'PipelineProcessing'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks identified; the code itself does not process data or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is visible; import statement alone does not establish data flow without further code.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement is standard, but without additional context or code, it is hard to determine if malicious behavior exists. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a relative module. It does not include any executable logic, data processing, or external communication. No anomalies, malicious code, or security issues are apparent in this single line. Due to lack of further context, no malicious activity can be inferred. The code appears normal and standard for module importation.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward import statement with no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any harmful actions by itself.",
