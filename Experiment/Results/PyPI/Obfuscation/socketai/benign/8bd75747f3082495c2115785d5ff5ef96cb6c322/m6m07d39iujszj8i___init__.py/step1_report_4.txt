{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a function that returns a list of dictionary objects, likely used for package or extension configuration.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement from ._version and the function yJquIwHspQSRvfXwTfPgidWsIJWFzjMj() which returns hardcoded data.",
  "sinks": "The function returns data but does not perform any data output, network communication, or data leakage. No untrusted data is used or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The imported version symbol is not used elsewhere. The function flow is simply returning static data, with no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement from a relative module with a seemingly obfuscated variable name and the function name appear unusual but not inherently malicious. The code lacks comments and context but does not show malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version symbol, possibly obfuscated, but does not use it elsewhere. The function yJquIwHspQSRvfXwTfPgidWsIJWFzjMj returns a static list with extension mapping, typical in package or extension configurations. No user input, network activity, or data manipulation is present. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident. The structure and content are simple and benign, suggesting this is configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving likely as a configuration or extension registration snippet. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified based on the provided code.",
