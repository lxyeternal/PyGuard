{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a function that returns a list of dictionaries mapping a source extension to a destination extension, likely for configuring or installing a JupyterLab extension.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the import statement from ._version, which imports a version identifier.",
  "sinks": "The function returns a static data structure; there are no sinks involving untrusted input or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "The imported version string flows into nothing; the main flow is the static return of a predefined list, with no dynamic or untrusted data involved.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol has an obfuscated or non-descriptive name, which could be an attempt to hide its purpose. The function name is non-descriptive, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a non-standard name from a local module, then defines a function that returns a fixed list of dictionaries mapping a source to a destination extension for JupyterLab. No user input, environment variables, or network operations are present. The import's symbol name appears intentionally obfuscated, which could be a minor anomaly. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code's structure is simple and static.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. The obfuscated import could be a minor anomaly but does not pose a threat.",
