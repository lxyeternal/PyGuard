{
  "purpose": "Provides static configuration for a JupyterLab extension, mapping source to destination extension names.",
  "sources": "Import from local module '._version' with an obfuscated symbol; function returns static data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data, user input, or external communication; static return value.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbol -> function returning static list; no external data flow or dynamic processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; import from '_version' with a non-descriptive symbol.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated symbol from a local module and defines a function with an obfuscated name that returns a static list of dictionaries. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment, but does not indicate malicious intent. The static data and lack of external interactions suggest benign configuration code. The obfuscated names are unusual but not malicious. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign static configuration snippet for a JupyterLab extension, with obfuscated identifiers but no malicious activity or security issues. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the code poses no security risk.",
