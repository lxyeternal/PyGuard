{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version variable import and a function that returns a configuration mapping for a JupyterLab extension.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a version identifier from a relative module",
  "sinks": "The function returns a data structure with static strings; no direct sinks or data flows involving untrusted input",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks involving untrusted data; static data is returned",
  "anomalies": "The imported variable has a seemingly obfuscated or non-descriptive name, which could be a sign of obfuscation or concealment; function name is non-descriptive, but no malicious behavior evident",
  "analysis": "The code imports a variable with a non-descriptive name, which may be intentionally obscure. The function 'yJquIwHspQSRvfXwTfPgidWsIJWFzjMj' returns a static list with a mapping related to JupyterLab extensions. There are no input sources, no dynamic code execution, and no data leaks. The overall structure suggests configuration rather than malicious behavior. No suspicious or malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet for a JupyterLab extension, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
