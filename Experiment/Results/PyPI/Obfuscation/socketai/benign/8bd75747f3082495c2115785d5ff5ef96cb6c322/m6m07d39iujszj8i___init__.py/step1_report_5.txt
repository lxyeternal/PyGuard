{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a function that returns a list of dependency mappings for a JupyterLab extension.",
  "sources": "Import from a local module '_version' and the function yJquIwHspQSRvfXwTfPgidWsIJWFzjMj() that returns static data.",
  "sinks": "The function returns static data; no untrusted input or external data sources are used.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code merely returns hardcoded data.",
  "anomalies": "The import from '_version' is unusual, but not inherently malicious; no suspicious or obfuscated code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version identifier from a local module, which is common for package versioning. The function yJquIwHspQSRvfXwTfPgidWsIJWFzjMj() returns a static list of dictionaries specifying source and destination extension identifiers for JupyterLab, with no processing of untrusted data. The naming of variables and functions appears obfuscated, possibly to evade simple pattern detection, but no malicious intent is evident. There are no network operations, credential handling, or code injection points. Overall, the code performs a benign, configuration-like role.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, static configuration module with obfuscated identifiers. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. No signs of supply chain attack, backdoors, or malware are present.",
