  "purpose": "Configure Jupyter server settings, either via a custom function or by setting default parameters if the import fails.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'configure_jupyter_server' from 'jupyterlab.galata'; assignments to 'c.ServerApp' attributes.",
  "sinks": "Assignments to 'c.ServerApp' attributes such as port, port_retries, open_browser, root_dir, token, password, disable_check_xsrf, and expose_app_in_browser.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import 'configure_jupyter_server' -> fallback to setting 'c.ServerApp' attributes if import fails; else call 'configure_jupyter_server(c)'.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded port (8888), empty token and password, disabling XSRF protection, setting root_dir to a temporary directory, enabling expose_app_in_browser without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a custom server configuration function. If unavailable, it sets server parameters to specific values: port 8888 (common default), disables security features such as token, password, and XSRF checks, and sets a temporary directory as root. These settings could potentially reduce security. There is no evidence of malicious code execution or malicious data handling. The code appears to be standard configuration logic with some insecure defaults, possibly for testing or development purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious behavior but sets insecure server configurations, which could be risky if used in production. The import fallback mechanism is straightforward, and no malicious activity is evident.",
