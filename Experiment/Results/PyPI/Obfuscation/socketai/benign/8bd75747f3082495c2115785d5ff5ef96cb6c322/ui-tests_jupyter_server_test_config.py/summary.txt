  "conclusion": "The code is not malicious but contains insecure configurations that could be exploited if used in production. The import path 'jupyterlab.galata' is suspicious but does not imply malicious activity. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is 0, and the security risk score is approximately 0.6, reflecting the insecure defaults."
