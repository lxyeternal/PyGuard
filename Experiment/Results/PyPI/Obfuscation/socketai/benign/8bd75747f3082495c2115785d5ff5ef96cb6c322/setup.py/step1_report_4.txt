{
  "purpose": "Call the setup function from the setuptools package, typically used for packaging Python projects.",
  "sources": "Import statement (__import__('setuptools')) which loads the setuptools module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "Import loads the module, then calls its setup() function.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; setup() called with no arguments, which is standard for packaging but unusual in a minimal script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'setuptools' module dynamically using __import__, then immediately calls setup() with default parameters. This pattern is often used in setup scripts to configure packaging. There are no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious behaviors, and no data flows involving untrusted input. The code does not perform any malicious actions, data leaks, or obfuscated operations. Its simplicity indicates it is likely part of a legitimate package setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, standard invocation of setuptools.setup(), commonly found in Python packaging scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
