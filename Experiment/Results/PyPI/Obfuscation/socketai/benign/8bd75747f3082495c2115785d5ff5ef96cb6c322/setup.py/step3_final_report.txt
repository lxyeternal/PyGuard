  "purpose": "Minimal invocation of setuptools.setup() for package configuration.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import of 'setuptools' module via __import__('setuptools')",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data sources; no network or file system operations",
  "flows": "Import of 'setuptools' -> call to setup() with no arguments",
  "anomalies": "Use of __import__() instead of standard import statement; no parameters passed to setup()",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'setuptools' module and calls its setup() function without arguments. This pattern is common in Python packaging scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, network activity, or obfuscation. The use of __import__() is unusual but not malicious in this context. The code is minimal, standard, and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, benign setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The use of __import__() does not indicate obfuscation or malicious activity. The overall security risk is negligible, and malware likelihood is zero.",
