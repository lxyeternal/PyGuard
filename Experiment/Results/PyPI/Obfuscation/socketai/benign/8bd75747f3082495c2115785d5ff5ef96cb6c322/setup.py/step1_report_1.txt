  "purpose": "Invoke setuptools to set up a Python package installation.",
  "sources": "No specific input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only calls a setup function.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; uses a dynamic import with a string, which could obscure behavior but is common in setup scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports the 'setuptools' module and calls its 'setup()' function, which is standard for packaging Python projects. There are no hardcoded credentials, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors. The use of __import__ with a string is typical in setup scripts and does not indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard setup script for a Python package, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
