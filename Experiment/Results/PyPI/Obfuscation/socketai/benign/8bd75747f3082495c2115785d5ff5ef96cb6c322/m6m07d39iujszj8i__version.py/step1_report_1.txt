  "purpose": "Define a version string for the module or package.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a string to the variable QWBqXmbbZAyanuBWXIjbFnzatyaNkZJS and VERSION.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The code assigns a static string to two variables; no flow from external input to any sink.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name QWBqXmbbZAyanuBWXIjbFnzatyaNkZJS appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but it's only used as a variable name for a version string.",
  "analysis": "The code simply assigns the string '3.4.0' to a variable with a long, seemingly random name, and also assigns it to VERSION. There is no indication of dynamic input, external data, or malicious code execution. The variable naming could suggest obfuscation, but given the context, it appears as a straightforward version assignment. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
