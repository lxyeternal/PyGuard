  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, only variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a string that appears to be a random or obfuscated sequence, but is only assigned to variables without further use",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a seemingly random string to two variables, 'QWBqXmbbZAyanuBWXIjbFnzatyaNkZJS' and 'VERSION'. The string does not interact with any system or external resource, nor does it perform any operations. This pattern may suggest obfuscation or placeholder data, but on its own, it does not exhibit malicious behavior. No evidence of data exfiltration, command execution, or malicious logic is present. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with a seemingly random string. There is no evidence of malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks based on this fragment alone.",
