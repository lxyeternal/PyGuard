  "purpose": "Assign a version string '3.4.0' to the variable named QWBqXmbbZAyanuBWXIjbFnzatyaNkZJS and VERSION",
  "sources": "Assignment of string to variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name QWBqXmbbZAyanuBWXIjbFnzatyaNkZJS; no other code present",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '3.4.0' to two variables, one with an obfuscated variable name and another named VERSION. No external input, no data processing, no network calls, or other suspicious behavior is present. The code appears to be a straightforward version assignment, albeit with an obfuscated variable name, which might be for obfuscation purposes or just non-standard naming.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment of a version string with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues.",
