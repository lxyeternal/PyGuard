  "purpose": "Assigns a version string '3.4.0' to two variables, one obfuscated and one standard.",
  "sources": "Static assignment of string to variables",
  "sinks": "None; no external data or untrusted input",
  "flows": "Assignment from static string to variables",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no malicious code or unusual behavior",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple static assignment of '3.4.0' to two variables, one with an obfuscated name. No external data sources, sinks, or dynamic behavior are present. The obfuscated variable name suggests potential obfuscation but does not indicate malicious intent. The code is benign, with no signs of malware, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation score is justified by the variable name, but overall, the code poses minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version string assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There is no malicious behavior or security risk detected.",
