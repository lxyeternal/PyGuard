  "purpose": "Define a version string for the package or module",
  "sources": "Assignment of the string to variables QWBqXmbbZAyanuBWXIjbFnzatyaNkZJS and VERSION",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name (QWBqXmbbZAyanuBWXIjbFnzatyaNkZJS) which appears obfuscated or randomly generated",
  "analysis": "The code assigns the string '3.4.0' to two variables: a long, seemingly obfuscated variable name and a more standard 'VERSION'. There are no input reads, data processing, or potentially malicious behaviors. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated variable name, which may indicate an attempt to hide or obscure code intent, but in this context, it is benign as it only involves a simple assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious activity, data leaks, or security issues are evident. The obfuscated variable name alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
