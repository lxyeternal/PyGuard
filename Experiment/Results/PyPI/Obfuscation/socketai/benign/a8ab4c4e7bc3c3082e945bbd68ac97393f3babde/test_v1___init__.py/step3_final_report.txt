  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code obfuscation indicators, dynamic execution points, data flow patterns, hardcoded secrets, network activity, code structure.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Sources such as obfuscated variables or dynamic eval() calls leading to sinks like network transmission or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic execution, placeholders or empty code, inconsistent security risk scores relative to suspicion levels.",
  "analysis": "The reports consistently link high obfuscation and dynamic code features with elevated malware and security risk scores, especially in Report 1, which is justified. Low suspicion in Reports 2-5 aligns with zero or minimal malware and obfuscation scores. Minor discrepancies, such as Report 2's security risk, are acknowledged but do not significantly impact overall assessment. The scores across reports are coherent with their respective analyses, with the highest suspicion in Report 1 and minimal suspicion in others.",
  "conclusion": "The most suspicious code is in Report 1, warranting a malware score of 0.75 and security risk of 0.8, justified by obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators. Other reports reflect benign or low-risk code, with scores appropriately low. Overall, the scoring system aligns well with the analyses, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
