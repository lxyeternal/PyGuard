  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated due to the absence of code content. It appears to be an empty or placeholder script.",
  "sources": "No data sources, input reads, or external data fetches are present in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data outputs, network connections, or file writes in the code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable as the code contains no executable statements or data handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code is empty with no apparent logic, variables, or structural elements, which is unusual for a functional script. The absence of content itself is suspicious and may indicate obfuscation or placeholder intent.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review shows no actual executable code, functions, data handling, or external interactions. The code appears to be empty or a template, which could be intentional or indicative of incomplete or obfuscated content. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity, are present. However, the lack of code is unusual and warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is empty with no functional logic or suspicious content. Its presence alone is not malicious, but the lack of implementation might suggest an incomplete or intentionally obfuscated script. No signs of malware or security risks are detected based on the provided content.",
