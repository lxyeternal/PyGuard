  "conclusion": "The most suspicious code is in Report 1, warranting a malware score of 0.75 and security risk of 0.8, justified by obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators. Other reports reflect benign or low-risk code, with scores appropriately low. Overall, the scoring system aligns well with the analyses, and no further adjustments are necessary."
