  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and data files.",
  "sources": "Environment variables and imported modules; hardcoded strings for package info.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks found that handle untrusted input; no network connections or data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flows; code primarily loads files and sets package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, including random-looking strings; no clear malicious logic present; no backdoors or hidden behaviors; usage of 'read' with 'rb' and 'utf-8' together in ENNOLyCCDRXcBTpTfgsjAvrvloraNWGY may be redundant but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines metadata for packaging, including package info, license, keywords, URLs, and package data. Variables with seemingly random or obfuscated names store strings related to package description, maintainer info, URLs, and other metadata. The function ENNOLyCCDRXcBTpTfgsjAvrvloraNWGY reads a file, which is typical for setup scripts. There are no network connections, no data collection, or suspicious operations. The obfuscation appears to be simply variable name mangling, not malicious. No malicious behavior or sabotage evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which might suggest an attempt to hide some details but does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No malware or security vulnerabilities are identified based on this review.",
