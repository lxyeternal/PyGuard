  "purpose": "Setuptools configuration script for packaging and distributing a Python library, including metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Imports from os.path and codecs, reading 'requirements.txt' and 'LICENSE' files, and access to environment variables via os.path and open.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present. No untrusted data handling, no network connections, or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Reads files from disk (requirements.txt, LICENSE), uses environment info to determine file paths, but no untrusted input processing or network activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and strings that do not directly correspond to their purpose, possibly to hinder analysis. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are detected. No suspicious code behavior such as code execution, data exfiltration, or network connections.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a standard setup.py-like script with obfuscated variable names and strings, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. It loads metadata and configuration for packaging a Python library. No suspicious behavior, such as code injection, network activity, or backdoors, is present. The obfuscation might be an attempt to hide the code's intent, but nothing malicious is evident from the logic. The script does not process untrusted inputs, connect to external domains, or perform harmful actions.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard package configuration script with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based on this analysis. The obfuscation may be suspicious but does not indicate malicious intent.",
