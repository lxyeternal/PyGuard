  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package, including metadata and package data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and 'LICENSE' files, environment variables, imported modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks detected; no code that writes or executes untrusted data",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; mainly static data and package setup functions",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and non-descriptive identifiers, which may suggest concealment. The code reads files and sets up package metadata in a typical manner. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic found.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of standard setup script for a Python package using setuptools. Variables are obfuscated but contain no evidence of malicious intent. The function reads files with 'rb' mode but encodes as 'utf-8', which may cause issues but not malicious. The metadata and URLs seem legitimate, pointing to a GitHub repository. No dynamic code execution, network calls, or data leaks are detected. Overall, the code appears benign and typical of a package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior or security risks identified. No suspicious or malicious code present.",
