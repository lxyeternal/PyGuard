  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining metadata and configuration.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' and 'LICENSE' files, package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Variable definitions used in setup(), no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable names; no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, which appear to be a stylistic choice rather than malicious. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious logic are present. The obfuscation does not involve code injection or malicious behavior, just variable name mangling. The file reading function operates normally, and the setup() call is typical for packaging. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, securityRisk around 0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0.4-0.7) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise is present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
