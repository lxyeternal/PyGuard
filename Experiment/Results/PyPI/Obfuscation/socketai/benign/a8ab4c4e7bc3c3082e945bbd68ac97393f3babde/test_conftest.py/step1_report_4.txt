  "purpose": "The code appears to perform a basic task, but without specific context, its purpose cannot be definitively identified.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly present; the code does not read from files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "There are no obvious sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system modifications.",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to critical points; the code seems self-contained.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns. No unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a simple, direct implementation with no external data inputs, no network activity, and no sensitive operations. It appears to be a benign, standard script without signs of malicious intent. Due to the limited scope, the risk assessment remains low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code shows no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign, straightforward script with no evident vulnerabilities or malicious actions.",
