  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be related to a Python package that may perform specific functions, but no explicit purpose is clear from the provided code snippet.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, function parameters, and potentially external modules or libraries.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file I/O, or system commands if present (not explicitly shown). No direct evidence of data leaks or system modifications in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input from environment variables or function arguments could flow into functions that perform system actions or network requests (not shown). No explicit flows are identifiable from the snippet provided.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected in the snippet. No backdoors or malicious constructs are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal and lacks complex logic or suspicious constructs. It uses standard Python features and third-party libraries without evident malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. Without additional code, it is difficult to identify any malicious flows or anomalies.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, but due to limited context, this assessment is made with low confidence.",
