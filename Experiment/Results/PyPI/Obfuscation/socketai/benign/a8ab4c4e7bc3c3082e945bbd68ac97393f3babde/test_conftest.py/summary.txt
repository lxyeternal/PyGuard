  "conclusion": "The dependency shows potential obfuscation and dynamic code execution, raising moderate suspicion but no definitive malicious activity. The overall security risk remains moderate, with a malware score around 0.35-0.4, obfuscation score near 0.7, and risk around 0.4. The evidence supports cautious but not alarmist conclusions."
