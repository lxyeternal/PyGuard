  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are apparent; no system calls, network connections, or data exfiltration points are visible.",
  "flows": "Without input sources or explicit data flows, there are no source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code constructs, or suspicious behaviors are observed. The code appears to be absent or non-functional.",
  "analysis": "The provided input contains no code to analyze. Consequently, there are no potential security issues, malicious behaviors, or anomalies to evaluate. The lack of code prevents any source, sink, or flow identification. Given this, no malicious or security concerns can be determined.",
  "conclusion": "No code was provided for review. Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The situation does not warrant warnings or alerts.",
