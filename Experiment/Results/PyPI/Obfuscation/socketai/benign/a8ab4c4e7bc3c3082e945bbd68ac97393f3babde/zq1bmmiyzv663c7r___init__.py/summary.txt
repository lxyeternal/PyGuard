  "conclusion": "Most packages show benign behavior with no malicious intent or obfuscation. The only notable concern is report 3, where the use of eval/exec and network/file operations warrants a slightly higher malware risk score. The current scores are appropriate, but increasing report 3's malware score from 0 to approximately 0.3 would better represent the potential risk. No evidence of actual malicious payloads or sabotage was found."
