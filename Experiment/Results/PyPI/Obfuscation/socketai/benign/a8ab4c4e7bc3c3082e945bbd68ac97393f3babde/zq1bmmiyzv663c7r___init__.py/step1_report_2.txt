  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is to perform a specific functionality, which is not explicitly provided in the snippet. The code appears to be part of a larger application or module, potentially related to data processing or network communication.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external inputs such as user input or files.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data may flow into network connections, file operations, or output functions. Potential sinks include socket connections, file writes, or print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or inputs through processing functions, potentially leading to sinks like network operations or file system writes.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns. The code uses standard library functions without obfuscation or dynamic code execution. No embedded URLs or suspicious imports are present. No backdoors or secret data handling are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward and utilizes common Python constructs. It reads from environment variables and function parameters, processes data, and performs network or file operations. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or covert channels are observed. The code structure is clear and consistent with typical data processing routines.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and aligns with standard practices. The overall security risk is low, and the confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
