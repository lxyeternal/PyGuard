  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Streamlit component wrapper with obfuscated variable names, likely for concealment or organizational purposes. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants attention but does not elevate the risk score significantly. The scores and reasoning in the reports are justified and consistent with the analysis."
