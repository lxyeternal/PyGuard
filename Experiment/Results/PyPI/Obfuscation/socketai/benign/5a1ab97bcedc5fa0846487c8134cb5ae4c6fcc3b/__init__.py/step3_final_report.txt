{
  "purpose": "Setup and configuration of a Streamlit code editor component with obfuscated variable names and environment-based resource loading.",
  "sources": "Obfuscated boolean variable controlling environment, os.path for directory paths, component declaration functions, and code parameters passed to the component.",
  "sinks": "Component declaration and instantiation; no data leaks, network requests, or malicious system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Boolean flag determines resource URL; component declaration uses local or build directory; code function creates component instance with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, conditional resource loading from localhost or local build directory, no external network activity, no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up a Streamlit custom component with obfuscated variable names, primarily for local development or concealment. No network requests, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The environment-based resource loading is typical for development. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.7-0.8) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. The overall assessment is that the code is benign, with obfuscation being the main concern but not evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Streamlit component wrapper with obfuscated variable names, likely for concealment or organizational purposes. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants attention but does not elevate the risk score significantly. The scores and reasoning in the reports are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
