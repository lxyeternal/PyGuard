  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code defines a Streamlit component for a code editor, with obfuscated variable names. No network requests or malicious data handling are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not directly indicate malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0.0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.6, Obfuscated: 0.8\n- **Assessment:** The low malware score aligns with the lack of malicious actions. The high obfuscation score is justified. The security risk is minimal, mainly due to obfuscation.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar setup with obfuscated variables and conditional component declaration (localhost URL or local build). No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.8, Obfuscated: 0.7\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with prior, no signs of malware, just obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Again, a component setup with obfuscated variables, conditional resource loading. No malicious activity evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.7, Obfuscated: 0.7\n- **Assessment:** No malicious behavior, obfuscation present.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Similar pattern—component declaration with obfuscated variables, local URLs, no malicious actions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.7, Obfuscated: 0.7\n- **Assessment:** No malicious activity, obfuscation remains the main concern.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern—component setup, obfuscated variables, no malicious actions.\n- **Scores:** Malware: 0, SecurityRisk: 0.2, Confidence: 0.85, Obfuscated: 0.7\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with others; no malware detected.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive of malware.\n- **Obfuscated Variable Names:** Present across all reports, likely to conceal intent or complexity.\n- **External Resources:** Only localhost URLs and local paths are used; no external malicious domains or data exfiltration observed.\n- **Behavior:** No network requests, no data leaks, no code injection, no suspicious system calls.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- The current malware scores (mostly 0, some at 0.0) are appropriate given the evidence.\n- The security risk scores (around 0.2) reflect cautious concern due to obfuscation but are justified as low risk.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the consistent absence of malicious indicators.\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 – no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7–0.8 – obfuscation is present but not necessarily malicious.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 – low, primarily due to obfuscation and environment setup.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0.0 (no signs of malicious activity)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.75 (obfuscation is high, but benign in this context)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (consistent with low but cautious assessment)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a standard Streamlit component wrapper with obfuscated variable names, likely for concealment or organizational purposes. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The obfuscation warrants attention but does not currently elevate the risk score significantly. Further review of the actual component source code or external dependencies could be warranted if suspicion persists.",
