      "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup utility with obfuscated naming and the use of exec() for version management. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or payloads. The main security concern is the exec() call, which could be exploited if 'version.py' is compromised. Overall, the code is benign but warrants caution regarding the source of 'version.py'."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate, with a moderate suspicion due to obfuscation but no active threat."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated API wrapper for PagerDuty's event management, with no evidence of malicious behavior in this fragment. The high obfuscation score is justified, but no active malicious actions are demonstrated. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate given the lack of malicious indicators. Further review of the complete codebase is recommended to confirm benign intent."
