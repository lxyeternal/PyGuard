  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Input/output functions, environment variable access, file handling, data parsing, network connections, data leaks, credential handling.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission points, file writes, environment variable access, system commands, data output, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input flow into processing functions, which may then send data over the network or write to files.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, placeholder or empty files, lack of meaningful logic, no suspicious patterns or obfuscation, no hardcoded secrets or credentials.",
  "analysis": "All reports without code correctly assign zero malware and obfuscation scores with high confidence. The report with code describes benign utility functions, with no suspicious patterns, and assigns a low security risk score (0.2), which is justified. The reasoning aligns with the code descriptions, and scores are consistent with the analysis. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks are present. The high confidence scores for absence of code are appropriate, and the low risk score for benign code is reasonable.",
  "conclusion": "The assessments are accurate and consistent. No evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is found. The low security risk score in the code-present report is justified. Overall, the reports' scores and reasoning are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
