{
  "purpose": "The code appears to implement a simple data processing or utility function, but without additional context, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from environment variables and function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Data may be output to logs or transmitted via network calls if present; however, no explicit sinks are observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or input parameters to functions and possibly to output functions or external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments detected. No unusual variable names or dynamic code execution found.",
  "analysis": "The code reads environment variables and processes input data through defined functions. It lacks external network calls, dynamic code evaluation, or data leaks. No suspicious or malicious behaviors are evident. The structure is straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code appears benign with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It functions as a typical utility or processing script without suspicious activity.",
