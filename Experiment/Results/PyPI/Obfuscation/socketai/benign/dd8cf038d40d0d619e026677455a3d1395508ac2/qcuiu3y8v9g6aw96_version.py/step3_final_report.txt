  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or analysis.",
  "sources": "Code reading environment variables, processing data, and potential data flows from input to output.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks through environment variables, network connections, or data processing functions.",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or data files to processing functions and possibly to network or storage sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code or suspicious patterns; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious functions detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, only providing assessments based on descriptions. The high confidence in benign behavior (e.g., reading environment variables without suspicious patterns) aligns with zero malware and obfuscation scores. Low risk scores are justified given the absence of suspicious activity. The scoring is consistent across reports, with zero or near-zero values for malware and obfuscation, and low risk scores. The confidence scores appropriately reflect the amount of available information, being high when code is analyzed and low when absent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided information, there is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
