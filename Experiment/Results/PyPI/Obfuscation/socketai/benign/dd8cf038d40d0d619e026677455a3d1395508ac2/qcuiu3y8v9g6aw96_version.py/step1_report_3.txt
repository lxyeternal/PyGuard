  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified in the absence of the actual code content. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns are apparent from the provided information.",
  "analysis": "Due to the lack of actual code, a detailed analysis cannot be performed. The review process requires inspecting code for suspicious patterns, input handling, and data flows. As the code was not provided, no conclusions about malicious behavior or security issues can be drawn.",
  "conclusion": "No code content provided for analysis; thus, no definitive assessment of malicious behavior or security risks can be made. Additional code is needed for a thorough review.",
