  "purpose": "The code imports a version attribute from a package and asserts its existence.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'dagster_pagerduty.version' module",
  "sinks": "Assertion statement which could terminate the program if __version__ is not set",
  "flows": "Import retrieves __version__, assertion verifies its presence",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation present; the function name appears obfuscated but is not malicious by itself",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version attribute from an external module and asserts that it exists. The function name is non-descriptive and appears intentionally obfuscated, which could be suspicious. However, the code itself only checks for the presence of a version string, which is standard. No malicious code, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is evident. The assertion could cause an exception if __version__ is missing, but this is a common pattern to ensure proper versioning.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple version check with an obfuscated function name. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The obfuscated function name might raise suspicion but does not indicate malicious behavior on its own.",
