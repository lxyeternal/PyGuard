  "purpose": "Static configuration data for Sphinx documentation project, including variables, lists, and dictionaries.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments, list/dictionary initializations, string literals",
  "sinks": "None; no external input, network communication, or dynamic code execution",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; static configuration only",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names but used consistently; no malicious code or behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration script with obfuscated variable names, but no dynamic or malicious behavior. It contains only data definitions for documentation setup, with no external inputs, network activity, or code execution. The obfuscation appears stylistic, not malicious. Scores of malware are zero, obfuscation moderate, and security risk negligible, consistent with benign static configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, static configuration for Sphinx documentation, with no indicators of malware or malicious intent. Obfuscation is superficial and does not pose security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate and justified.",
