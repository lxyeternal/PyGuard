{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up configuration variables and metadata for a Sphinx documentation project, including filenames, project info, and static/static directories.",
  "sources": "Data is read from hardcoded string assignments and list/tuple literals; no external inputs are processed.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data is used in a way that could lead to data leakage or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; all data is statically defined within the script.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, suspicious code execution, or obfuscated code are present. Variable names are obfuscated but used consistently for configuration purposes.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily contains variable assignments for project metadata, filenames, and configuration settings for Sphinx documentation. All data appears to be static and hardcoded. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, code injection, or data exfiltration. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The absence of external inputs and suspicious function calls suggests this code is benign and intended for documentation setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a configuration script for a Sphinx documentation project with no malicious intent. It contains only static configuration data and no suspicious behaviors or security risks.",
