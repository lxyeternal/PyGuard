  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a visualization utility with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score is moderate to high due to variable and module name complexity, but this does not imply malicious activity. Overall, the code poses no significant security threat."
