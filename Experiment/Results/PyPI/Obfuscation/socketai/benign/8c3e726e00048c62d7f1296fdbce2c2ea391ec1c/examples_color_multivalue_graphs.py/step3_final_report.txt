{
  "purpose": "The code generates ASCII graphs with color annotations for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded data structures, module imports, and ANSI escape sequences embedded in labels.",
  "sinks": "Output to stdout via print statements; no external data or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded variables and data structures into visualization functions, ultimately printed to the console.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and class names, ANSI escape sequences for coloring, and complex nested data structures; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily for ASCII visualization, with superficial obfuscation through variable naming and data formatting. No signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection are present. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic rather than malicious. The data and functions used are consistent with benign visualization tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a visualization utility with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score is moderate to high due to variable and module name complexity, but this does not imply malicious activity. Overall, the code poses no significant security threat.",
