{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate and display ASCII graphs with color enhancements, likely for visualization or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Imports from ascii_graph modules; data structures containing numerical values and color-coded labels; reading of predefined data and configuration variables.",
  "sinks": "Output to standard output via print statements; no other apparent sinks. No external data sinks or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data is initialized from hardcoded variables, passed into graph objects, which then generate visual output; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; inclusion of color escape sequences in labels; multiple instances of dynamically created graph objects; no clear user input or external data sources; no apparent malicious code or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes several data structures with numerical and color information, then creates graph objects with specific parameters. It generates and prints ASCII graphs twice with different configurations. The code contains obfuscated variable names, but the logic is consistent with visualization tasks. No code injection, external network activity, or suspicious operations are present. The use of escape sequences is for coloring, not malicious. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are detected. Overall, the code appears to serve visualization purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for ASCII graph visualization with colored labels. No malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks are detected. The obfuscation is superficial and likely for code brevity or style, not malicious intent.",
