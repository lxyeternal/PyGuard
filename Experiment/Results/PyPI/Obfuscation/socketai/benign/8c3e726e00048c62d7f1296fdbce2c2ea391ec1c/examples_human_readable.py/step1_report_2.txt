{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate and print ASCII graphs using external library functions, likely for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from predefined variables and function parameters; no external data sources or user input are directly read.",
  "sinks": "Output is directed to print statements, displaying generated ASCII graphs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from predefined variables and function calls through the ASCII graph generation functions to print output; no untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import statement from 'ascii_graph' suggests potential hiding of functionality; use of unclear variable names and lack of explicit data validation. The code loads modules and then performs graph rendering without any evident malicious logic. The code is written in Python 2, which could imply outdated or less secure practices, but no malicious behavior is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The script imports modules from 'ascii_graph' and 'ascii_graph.colordata', then creates instances of 'EufQRmnSrQZyBOHWmzZnOtQBnrdsfoGs' with specific parameters. It generates ASCII graphs with these instances, passing predefined datasets. The data is static, hardcoded, and solely used for visualization. There are no input sanitization, no network connections, or file operations that could be malicious. The obfuscated import statement and variable names suggest an attempt to hide the code's intent, but no malicious actions or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system modification are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a visualization tool for ASCII graphs with static data, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial, likely intended to conceal implementation details, but does not contribute to malicious behavior.",
