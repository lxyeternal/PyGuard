  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASCII graph visualization utility with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The low malware score (0.1) and moderate obfuscation score (0.6) are justified. The overall security risk remains low (0.2). Continuous review of external dependencies is recommended if sourced from untrusted origins."
