{
  "purpose": "The code generates ASCII graphs from static, hardcoded datasets using obfuscated module and variable names, primarily for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from hardcoded tuples and dictionaries, and imports modules and symbols with obfuscated or nonsensical names.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network communication, file I/O, or system modifications; the code only prints generated ASCII graphs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded datasets through ASCII graph generation functions, with no external input or untrusted data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import statements and class/variable names, references to undefined variables, use of Python 2 shebang, and lack of context for some symbols suggest superficial obfuscation or incomplete code.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to produce ASCII visualizations from static data. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly intended to conceal simplicity or proprietary nature. No malicious payloads, network activity, or system modifications are present. The undefined variables and strange import symbols could be external dependencies or incomplete snippets. The overall behavior is benign, with obfuscation being the main concern but not indicative of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign ASCII graph visualization utility with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The low malware score (0.1) and moderate obfuscation score (0.6) are justified. The overall security risk remains low (0.2). Continuous review of external dependencies is recommended if sourced from untrusted origins.",
