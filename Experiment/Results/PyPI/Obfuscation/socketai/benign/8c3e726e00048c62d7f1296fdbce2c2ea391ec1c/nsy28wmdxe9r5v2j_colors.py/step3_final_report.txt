  "purpose": "The code defines a set of variables assigned to ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, intended for coloring terminal output.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments; no external input or data reading.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or output; no data leaks or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, static, and purely cosmetic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments to ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling, with no functions, data flows, external inputs, or dynamic logic. It is static and intended for cosmetic purposes. No malicious routines, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs are present. The variables are named with arbitrary strings but assigned static escape code strings. Given the absence of dynamic behavior, external communication, or obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk. The malware score should be 0, obfuscated score 0, and security risk very low (~0.05). The code is benign and poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of ANSI escape sequence definitions for terminal styling, with no malicious or security concerns. The existing reports' scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
