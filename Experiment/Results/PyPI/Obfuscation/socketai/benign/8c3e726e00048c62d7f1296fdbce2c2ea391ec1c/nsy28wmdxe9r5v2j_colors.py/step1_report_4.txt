{
  "purpose": "The code defines a series of string variables containing ANSI escape codes for colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "Assignment of ANSI escape sequence strings to variables, with no input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leaks or external data manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are statically assigned values.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of color code definitions; no obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares multiple variables assigned to ANSI escape code strings for coloring terminal output, using consistent pattern and naming. No dynamic execution, external input, or suspicious logic is present. All variables are static, and no code injection or malicious activity is evident. This appears to be a standard color code palette setup for terminal formatting.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely to define ANSI color codes for terminal output customization. No malicious intent or security issues are present.",
