{
  "purpose": "The code defines a series of string variables that contain ANSI escape sequences for colored terminal output.",
  "sources": "These variables are assigned static string values; no input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process or output data dynamically.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, input processing, or data manipulation pathways.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with escape sequences; no suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be purely defining color codes for terminal output, using ANSI escape sequences. There are no functions, no data input/output handling, and no dynamic execution or suspicious constructs. All variables are statically assigned; no malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code’s purpose seems to be for styling terminal output in a larger program, with no indicators of malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely as a set of color definitions for terminal styling. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security threats present. The code's structure and content are consistent with standard usage for terminal colorization.",
