{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of string variables assigned to ANSI escape codes used for terminal text coloring and formatting.",
  "sources": "The variables are assigned static string values, with no data input or external data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data output points that could lead to data leaks or execution of untrusted code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists, as all assignments are static and hardcoded.",
  "anomalies": "The code solely consists of color and style escape sequences, with no signs of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or data exfiltration routines are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists entirely of variable assignments to ANSI escape sequences for terminal styling. These variables are statically defined with no dynamic execution, user input, or external dependencies. There are no functions, network calls, or suspicious constructs. The purpose appears to be purely aesthetic, likely used for colored terminal output.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to define styling variables for terminal output. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present.",
