{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a set of variables associated with ANSI escape sequences for colored terminal output formatting.",
  "sources": "The variables are assigned string literals representing ANSI escape codes, which are constants. No external input or data reading occurs.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data flows to potentially dangerous functions or outputs are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code solely assigns constant strings to variables.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists entirely of string assignments for terminal color codes, with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No malicious behavior or privacy violations are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines ANSI escape sequence variables, likely for use in coloring terminal output. There are no inputs, no outputs, and no operations that could lead to security issues. The code is straightforward and lacks any obfuscated or suspicious logic. It appears to be a configuration or styling utility, not malicious or risky.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains only ANSI escape code definitions for terminal coloring, with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. It is benign and purely cosmetic.",
