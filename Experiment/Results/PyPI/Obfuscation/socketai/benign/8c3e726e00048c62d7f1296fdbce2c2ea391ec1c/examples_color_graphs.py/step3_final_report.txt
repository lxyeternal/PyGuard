{
  "purpose": "The code generates ASCII graphs with hardcoded datasets, utilizing obfuscated class and variable names, primarily for data visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded tuples containing labels, values, and color variables within the script.",
  "sinks": "Output printed to stdout via print statements.",
  "flows": "Data from hardcoded tuples passed into ASCII graph class methods, resulting in visual output.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical class and variable names, unusual import syntax, repeated recreation of graph objects, and use of deprecated Python 2 syntax.",
  "analysis": "The script is a heavily obfuscated ASCII graph visualization utility with no external input, network activity, or file operations. The obfuscation appears to be used to conceal the code's true nature but does not indicate malicious intent. No evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, data exfiltration, or system modification was found. The code's primary function is data visualization, and its obfuscation warrants caution but not malicious classification.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, albeit heavily obfuscated, ASCII graph plotting script with no detected malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware likelihood remains zero. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), though obfuscation should be reviewed further for potential concealment of malicious code.",
