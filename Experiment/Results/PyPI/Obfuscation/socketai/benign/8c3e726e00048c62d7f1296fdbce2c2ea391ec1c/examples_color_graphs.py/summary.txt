  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, albeit heavily obfuscated, ASCII graph plotting script with no detected malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware likelihood remains zero. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), though obfuscation should be reviewed further for potential concealment of malicious code."
