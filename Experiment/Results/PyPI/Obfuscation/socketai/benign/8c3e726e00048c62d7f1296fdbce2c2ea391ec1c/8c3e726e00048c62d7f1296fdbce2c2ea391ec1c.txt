The low malware score (0.1) and moderate obfuscation score (0.6) are justified. The overall security risk remains low (0.2). Continuous review of external dependencies is recommended if sourced from untrusted origins."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with nonsensical attribute checks and variable names, raising suspicion. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network communication or system modification. The obfuscation warrants caution, but based on current analysis, it appears benign. The scores should be malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 0.4."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a visualization utility with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent or behavior. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score is moderate to high due to variable and module name complexity, but this does not imply malicious activity. Overall, the code poses no significant security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, albeit heavily obfuscated, ASCII graph plotting script with no detected malicious activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware likelihood remains zero. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), though obfuscation should be reviewed further for potential concealment of malicious code."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a complex, obfuscated test suite for ASCII art and data visualization, with no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain sabotage. The obfuscation and Unicode characters are stylistic or for concealment but do not currently suggest malicious payloads. The overall security risk is low, and the likelihood of malware is negligible based on the provided code."

Its obfuscation warrants caution, but static analysis indicates a benign purpose. The malware score is set to 0.1 due to heavy obfuscation, but the lack of malicious indicators suggests it is likely safe. The overall security risk is low, approximately 0.2, primarily due to obfuscation rather than malicious intent."
