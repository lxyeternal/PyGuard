{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated code performing data encoding and printing, likely for visualization or testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Input data from a list of tuples and a Unicode string, both used as arguments to a method call.",
  "sinks": "Output via print statement after encoding data in UTF-8.",
  "flows": "Data from the list and string flows into a method of an imported class, then the result is encoded and printed.",
  "anomalies": "Invalid attribute check on sys object; obfuscated variable and class names; Unicode characters used in data and labels; nonsensical comparison that would raise an AttributeError.",
  "analysis": "The code contains heavy obfuscation with nonsensical attribute access and obfuscated names, suggesting an attempt to conceal its true purpose. The attribute check on sys is invalid and would cause an error, indicating either obfuscation or malformed code. The import and usage of an external class with obfuscated names, along with Unicode characters, further support obfuscation. No network activity, file access, or system modifications are evident. The script primarily encodes and prints data, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system compromise. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) is justified, while the malware score remains at 0.0 due to lack of evidence of malicious activity. The overall security risk is moderate (around 0.4), reflecting the obfuscation and suspicious structure but no active threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with nonsensical attribute checks and variable names, raising suspicion. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network communication or system modification. The obfuscation warrants caution, but based on current analysis, it appears benign. The scores should be malware: 0.0, obfuscated: 0.8, security risk: 0.4.",
