  "purpose": "Define a custom HTML card class for Metaflow with specific attributes and data retrieval logic.",
  "sources": "The class retrieves data from task dictionaries via 'task[self._attr_nm].data' and from 'runtime_data' attribute, as well as using a hardcoded HTML string.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from 'JYBpoABwVKtMfsTzPMrxNRqlcAHpnsio' method is returned as a string, potential exposure is limited; no direct data leak or untrusted sink identified.",
  "flows": "Input data from 'task' dictionary and 'runtime_data' are processed and returned; no external network or system calls are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, which could be suspicious. The hardcoded HTML string is benign, but the obfuscation raises suspicion. The code does not include any malicious behavior like data exfiltration or system modification.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from MetaflowCard with obfuscated class and method names. It initializes with an 'attribute' option defaulting to 'html'. The method 'JYBpoABwVKtMfsTzPMrxNRqlcAHpnsio' retrieves HTML data either from the provided task or from runtime data, defaulting to a hardcoded HTML string. The code's obfuscation and structure could indicate an attempt to hide its purpose, but there is no evidence of malicious activity, such as network access, data theft, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign custom card implementation with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from the provided snippet. Its main concern is the obfuscation, which could be intended to hide malicious intent, but based on the content, it seems benign.",
