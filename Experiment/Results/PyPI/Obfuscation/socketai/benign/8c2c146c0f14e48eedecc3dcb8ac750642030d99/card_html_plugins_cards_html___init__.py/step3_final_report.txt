{
  "purpose": "Provides a custom HTML card for Metaflow, retrieving HTML content from task data or runtime data, with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "Reads HTML data from task[self._attr_nm] and self.runtime_data['user']",
  "sinks": "Returns HTML content directly, which could be rendered in a browser",
  "flows": "Source data (task/self.runtime_data) -> method returning HTML string",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; no sanitization of external HTML data",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of MetaflowCard that retrieves HTML content from specified sources or defaults to a static HTML string. It uses obfuscated identifiers, which may hide intent but do not indicate malicious activity. No network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration are present. The main concern is handling untrusted HTML data without sanitization, posing potential XSS risks if rendered unsanitized downstream. Malware activity is not evident; the code only returns HTML strings. Obfuscation is high, but this alone does not imply malicious intent. The code appears benign, with a moderate security concern related to unvalidated HTML handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated implementation of a Metaflow HTML card component. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The primary concern is the handling of untrusted HTML data without sanitization, which could pose security risks if misused. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants caution regarding HTML sanitization in deployment.",
