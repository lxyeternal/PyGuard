  "conclusion": "The code fragment is a simple module with heavily obfuscated internal identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats in this snippet. The high obfuscation scores are justified but do not imply malicious intent. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscation around 0.75, and overall security risk near 0.1. Further inspection of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their safety."
