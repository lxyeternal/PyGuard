  "purpose": "Import heavily obfuscated classes/functions from local modules and expose specific symbols via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from .assets, .manager, .release, and .stream modules with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present; only static import/export statements.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbols → exposure via __all__; no data flow or execution beyond imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated identifiers for imported symbols; absence of active code or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with heavily obfuscated names and an __all__ declaration. No functions, data processing, network activity, or dynamic behavior are present. The obfuscation could be an attempt to conceal functionality but does not in itself indicate malicious intent. The low malware scores (0 or 0.2) and low security risk scores are appropriate given the limited context. The high obfuscation scores (around 0.75) reflect suspicion but are justified by the naming. Overall, the code appears benign, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules to ensure they do not contain malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is a simple module with heavily obfuscated internal identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats in this snippet. The high obfuscation scores are justified but do not imply malicious intent. The malware score should be set to 0, obfuscation around 0.75, and overall security risk near 0.1. Further inspection of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their safety.",
