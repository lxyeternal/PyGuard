  "conclusion": "The code performs standard asynchronous data streaming from an HTTP response to a file, with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network abuse. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score is appropriate, and the overall security risk remains low, though obfuscation should be reviewed if used in sensitive environments."
