{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define module exports and import obfuscated or intentionally renamed internal components for a Python package related to stream reading and writing.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .base, ._reader, ._writer",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to internal names; exports are explicitly defined in __all__, no data flow from untrusted sources",
  "anomalies": "The imported functions/classes are named with non-descriptive, seemingly random strings, indicating possible obfuscation. No actual code execution or data handling is present here.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports functions or classes from internal modules and defines an __all__ export list. The naming of imported entities is obfuscated, which might be an attempt to hide true functionality, but there are no active operations, data processing, or suspicious behavior observed. No credentials, network calls, or malicious operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple module setup with obfuscated internal references and no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation may hinder understanding but does not necessarily indicate malicious intent. No security risks identified in this snippet.",

  "obfuscated": 0.9,
