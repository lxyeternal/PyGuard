  "purpose": "Re-export internal obfuscated symbols for external use, serving as an interface module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (.base, ._reader, ._writer) with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; potential risk if imported modules contain malicious code, but not evident here.",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; only import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of imported identifiers; no active logic or data processing present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports obfuscated symbols from internal modules and defines __all__ for public API exposure. No executable logic, network activity, or data flow is present. The obfuscation could be benign or malicious; without inspecting imported modules, risk assessment is limited. The code appears to serve as a minimal interface or re-export module, with no signs of malicious behavior in this fragment. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a minimal re-export module with heavily obfuscated internal identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks within this fragment. The obfuscation suggests caution, especially if the imported modules are untrusted, but overall, the code appears benign. Further analysis of the imported modules is recommended to rule out hidden malicious behavior.",
