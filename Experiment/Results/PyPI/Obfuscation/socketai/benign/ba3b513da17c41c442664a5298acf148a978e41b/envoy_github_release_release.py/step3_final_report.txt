  "purpose": "A class implementing GitHub release management functions, including creating, deleting, and uploading assets via the GitHub API.",
  "sources": "API responses, environment variables, local file paths, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network API calls, file system operations, logging outputs.",
  "flows": "API data drives release actions; network interactions and file manipulations are standard.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious network or file activity; cryptic class/method names suggest obfuscation or auto-generation but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, async-based wrapper around GitHub release APIs, performing typical operations such as creating, deleting, and uploading assets. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are evident. The obfuscated naming is likely stylistic or due to code generation, not malicious obfuscation. API interactions are standard, with proper error handling. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious network connections, or sabotage are present. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.2-0.3, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, low-risk implementation of a GitHub release management tool. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain security posture of this dependency is sound.",
