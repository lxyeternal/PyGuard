  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Accurately describes the code as a GitHub release manager, with API interactions and file operations.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The code is standard for release automation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, no malicious activity, high confidence (0.9). Slightly elevated obfuscated score (0.2) due to cryptic class/method names, but this is likely obfuscation or auto-generation, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Similar to report 1, describing standard release management.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious patterns, well-structured code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appears legitimate, high confidence (0.9). Obfuscation score is 0, indicating clarity.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Again, a typical release management system.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No secrets or backdoors. Uses standard API calls. No suspicious activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9). Obfuscation score 0.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Same pattern—GitHub release handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious code or secrets. Obfuscation is present but likely due to code style or auto-generation.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9). Obfuscation score 0.3, which is acceptable given the variable naming.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.3 — reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks:** Same as others, managing releases via API.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious activity. Obfuscation may be present but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Legitimate, high confidence (0.9). Obfuscation score 0.2.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Risk=0.2, Obfuscated=0.2 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports agree on 0, indicating no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Slight variation (0.2–0.3), likely due to cryptic class/method names, which is typical in auto-generated or obfuscated code but not inherently malicious.\n- **Risk Score:** Uniformly low (0.2), appropriate for a release management tool that interacts with external APIs but doesn't perform any risky operations beyond standard API calls.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.2** — minor obfuscation, probably due to naming conventions.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — typical for such tools, no active vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors.\n\n**Conclusion:** The code appears to be a legitimate, well-structured implementation of a GitHub release manager with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The low obfuscation score is acceptable given the naming style, and the overall risk remains minimal.",
