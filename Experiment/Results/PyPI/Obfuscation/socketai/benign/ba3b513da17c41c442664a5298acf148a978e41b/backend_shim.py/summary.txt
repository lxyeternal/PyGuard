  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build script with significant obfuscation. No active malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation level justifies a high obfuscation score but does not elevate malware or risk scores beyond low to moderate. Continued vigilance is recommended if further code or context suggests malicious activity."
