  "purpose": "Build script utilizing setuptools' legacy build functions to generate distribution files.",
  "sources": "Import of setuptools.build_meta and access to its __legacy__ attribute; configuration variables; conditional calls to build functions with parameters.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting build paths, potentially leaking environment info.",
  "flows": "Import setuptools.build_meta -> access __legacy__ -> conditionally invoke build functions passing directory and config -> print build paths.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; dynamic attribute access; indirect function calls; lack of comments or input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a build script that employs obfuscated variable names and dynamic function calls, which are unusual but not inherently malicious. It performs standard build operations, with print statements revealing build paths. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply an obfuscation tactic. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.2, obfuscation ~0.7, risk ~0.2) are consistent with the evidence. The absence of malicious indicators suggests this is a legitimate build script employing obfuscation, warranting cautious monitoring but not immediate concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate build script with significant obfuscation. No active malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation level justifies a high obfuscation score but does not elevate malware or risk scores beyond low to moderate. Continued vigilance is recommended if further code or context suggests malicious activity.",
