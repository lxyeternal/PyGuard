      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of exec() on an external file, which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. No evidence of malicious payloads is present, but the pattern is risky. Variable naming suggests obfuscation, increasing suspicion. Overall, the code is standard but should be reviewed for validation of external code before execution. The risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low but non-negligible."

      "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration file with a notable security risk stemming from dynamic execution of external code. While no active malware is present, the pattern warrants caution, especially regarding the trustworthiness of the external '_metadata.py' file. Obfuscated variable names add to suspicion but are not conclusive. The main recommendation is to avoid using exec() on external files unless their integrity is verified, and to replace obfuscated identifiers with clearer, safer code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated client implementation for a cometd messaging system. While obfuscation can be used to conceal malicious behavior, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as data theft, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The high obfuscation score reflects the difficulty in fully understanding the code's intent, but the overall behavior appears legitimate. Continuous monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended if deployed in production environments."

      "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior based on static analysis. The obfuscation is significant but not necessarily malicious. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score of 0.0, but the obfuscation warrants cautious monitoring. The scores are consistent with the observed code characteristics."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OAuth2 client for Salesforce, with superficial obfuscation in most cases. The anomalies in Report 5, including high obfuscation, syntax errors, and inconsistent attribute references, raise suspicion and suggest potential malicious intent or code tampering. While no active malicious behavior is evident, the obfuscation and anomalies justify a cautious approach. The malware score should be low but slightly elevated to reflect suspicion in the most obfuscated report. The overall security risk remains low, but further static and dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm the absence of malicious activity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a collection of obfuscated test cases for exception hierarchies and propagation, with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or complexity, not malicious intent. The supply chain security risk from this code is negligible."

      "conclusion": "The code is generally benign with some suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution signals. No confirmed malware is present. The scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to malware suspicion for reports indicating obfuscation. Overall, the dependency appears low risk but warrants attention if further code reveals more malicious patterns."
