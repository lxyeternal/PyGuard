  "purpose": "Static metadata declarations for the package 'aiosfstream', including URLs, version, author info, and description.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static string assignments and dictionary definitions.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flows; static assignments without dynamic or input-driven behavior.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names in one fragment, but no malicious code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static string assignments representing package metadata, URLs, author info, and version. No dynamic code, network activity, or input handling is present. The only notable point is the obfuscated variable names, which could be a form of obfuscation but do not indicate malicious intent. The absence of code execution, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors suggests this is benign metadata. The obfuscation score is high in one report, but without evidence of malicious activity, it remains a concern rather than a confirmed threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static metadata with no signs of malicious behavior. Obfuscation is present but does not imply malicious intent. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the malware likelihood is effectively zero.",
