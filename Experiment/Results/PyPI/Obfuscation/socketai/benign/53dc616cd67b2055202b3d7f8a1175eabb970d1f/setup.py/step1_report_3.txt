  "purpose": "The code defines a setup configuration for a Python package, including dependencies and metadata, to facilitate package distribution and installation.",
  "sources": "File reading operations for '_metadata.py' and the setup function parameters, including reading external files and executing code from a file.",
  "sinks": "Execution of code via 'exec' on the contents of '_metadata.py', which could potentially execute malicious code if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "Reading and executing '_metadata.py' -> execution of its code -> influence on package metadata and setup parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' to run code from an external file '_metadata.py', which is a significant security concern if the file is tampered with or malicious. The rest of the code is standard setup configuration.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily handles package setup, dependencies, and metadata. The critical point is the use of 'exec' to execute code from a file '_metadata.py'. This practice can be exploited if the file content is malicious or has been altered. No other suspicious patterns or obfuscated code are present. The dependency lists are typical and do not contain suspicious entries. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or network connections. Overall, the major security concern centers on the 'exec' statement which can run arbitrary code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is largely standard for Python package setup but includes a risky use of 'exec' to run an external script '_metadata.py'. This could potentially be malicious if the file is compromised. Otherwise, there are no signs of malicious intent or malware within this script.",
