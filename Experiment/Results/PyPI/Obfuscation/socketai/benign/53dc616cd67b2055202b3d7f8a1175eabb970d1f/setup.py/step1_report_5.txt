  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading the _metadata.py file for dynamic metadata; importing standard libraries; static lists for dependencies.",
  "sinks": "exec() call executing code from _metadata.py, which could potentially execute malicious or tampered code if the file is compromised.",
  "flows": "read() function reads and executes _metadata.py, which may define variables that are used in setup() parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on dynamically read file content is unusual and risky; no hardcoded secrets or credentials observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup process with dependency definitions and metadata, but the use of exec() on an external file introduces a potential security risk if that file is malicious or compromised. All other code appears standard for a setup script. The dependencies and setup parameters are static and typical for a Python package. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or malicious code found. The exec() call is the primary anomaly due to its potential to execute malicious code if the _metadata.py file is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical setup configuration with a notable risk stemming from the use of exec() to execute external code. If the _metadata.py file is trusted and secure, the risk is minimal; otherwise, this represents a potential attack vector.",
