  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of exec() on an external file, which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. No evidence of malicious payloads is present, but the pattern is risky. Variable naming suggests obfuscation, increasing suspicion. Overall, the code is standard but should be reviewed for validation of external code before execution. The risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low but non-negligible."
