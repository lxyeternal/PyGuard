{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, defining dependencies, reading metadata from a separate file, and configuring package installation parameters.",
  "sources": "Reading from the filesystem (e.g., 'aiosfstream/_metadata.py') and potentially external files through the 'read' function.",
  "sinks": "exec() function executing code read from '_metadata.py' which could execute arbitrary code; the setup() function configuring package installation.",
  "flows": "Reading and executing '_metadata.py' to inject variables, then passing these variables into setup() for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code from an external file '_metadata.py' without validation; no explicit validation or sandboxing. The code dynamically loads metadata and then uses it in setup().",
  "analysis": "The script reads metadata from '_metadata.py' and executes it, which could be malicious if that file contains harmful code. The setup() call uses the loaded metadata, which depends on the content of '_metadata.py'. All dependencies are standard. The presence of exec() on external code without validation is a security concern. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns are evident beyond this. The code appears to be a typical setup script with dynamic metadata loading, but the use of exec() poses a risk if '_metadata.py' is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of exec() to run external code from '_metadata.py'. If this file is malicious or tampered with, it could execute arbitrary code during setup, posing a significant security risk. Otherwise, the code functions as a typical setup script with no explicit malicious behavior.",
