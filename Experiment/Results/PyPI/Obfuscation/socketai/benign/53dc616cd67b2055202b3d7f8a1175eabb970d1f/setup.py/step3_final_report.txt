  "anomalies": "Use of exec() on external file without validation; obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code reads metadata from '_metadata.py' and executes it dynamically, which poses a security risk if the file is malicious or compromised. The obfuscated variable names suggest potential obfuscation but are not inherently malicious. Dependencies are standard, and no other suspicious patterns are present. The primary concern is the use of exec() without validation, which could allow arbitrary code execution. The variable obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns justify some suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of exec() on an external file, which could execute malicious code if the file is compromised. No evidence of malicious payloads is present, but the pattern is risky. Variable naming suggests obfuscation, increasing suspicion. Overall, the code is standard but should be reviewed for validation of external code before execution. The risk is moderate, and the malware likelihood is low but non-negligible.",
