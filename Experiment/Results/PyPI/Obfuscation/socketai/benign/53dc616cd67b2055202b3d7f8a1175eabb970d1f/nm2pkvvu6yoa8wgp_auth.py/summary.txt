  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OAuth2 client for Salesforce, with superficial obfuscation in most cases. The anomalies in Report 5, including high obfuscation, syntax errors, and inconsistent attribute references, raise suspicion and suggest potential malicious intent or code tampering. While no active malicious behavior is evident, the obfuscation and anomalies justify a cautious approach. The malware score should be low but slightly elevated to reflect suspicion in the most obfuscated report. The overall security risk remains low, but further static and dynamic analysis is recommended to confirm the absence of malicious activity."
