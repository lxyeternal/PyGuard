  "conclusion": "The script is a benign configuration file with a notable security risk stemming from dynamic execution of external code. While no active malware is present, the pattern warrants caution, especially regarding the trustworthiness of the external '_metadata.py' file. Obfuscated variable names add to suspicion but are not conclusive. The main recommendation is to avoid using exec() on external files unless their integrity is verified, and to replace obfuscated identifiers with clearer, safer code."
