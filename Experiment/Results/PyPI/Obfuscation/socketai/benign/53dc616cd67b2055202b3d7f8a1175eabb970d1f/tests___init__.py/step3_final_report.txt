  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code signals such as obfuscation, dynamic execution, hardcoded secrets, and suspicious network or system calls.",
  "sources": "Input from 'input.txt', environment variables, network sockets, subprocess calls, eval/exec functions, and any dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (sending data, connecting to domains), subprocess execution, environment variable access, potential data leaks, and dynamic code evaluation points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources ('input.txt', environment variables) through processing functions, potentially reaching network or subprocess sinks, especially if eval/exec or obfuscated code is involved.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscation signs, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets, unusual variable naming, or suspicious network activity without clear context.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical data processing with network and subprocess calls, with some reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic code patterns. No concrete malicious activity is confirmed; suspicion arises mainly from obfuscation and dynamic execution signals. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.1-0.3, obfuscation 0.65-0.7, risk 0.4) are consistent with the described behaviors. Slight adjustments to malware scores for reports 2 and 4 to 0.3 would better reflect the suspicion level given the signs of obfuscation and dynamic code usage. Overall, the assessments are cautious but justified, with no definitive malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The code is generally benign with some suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution signals. No confirmed malware is present. The scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to malware suspicion for reports indicating obfuscation. Overall, the dependency appears low risk but warrants attention if further code reveals more malicious patterns.",
