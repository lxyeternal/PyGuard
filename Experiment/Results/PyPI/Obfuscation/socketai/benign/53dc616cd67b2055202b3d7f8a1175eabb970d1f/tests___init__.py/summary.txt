  "malware_score": 0.3,
  "security_risk": 0.4,
  "obfuscated": 0.65,

  "conclusion": "The code is generally benign with some suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic execution signals. No confirmed malware is present. The scores are appropriate, with minor adjustments to malware suspicion for reports indicating obfuscation. Overall, the dependency appears low risk but warrants attention if further code reveals more malicious patterns."
