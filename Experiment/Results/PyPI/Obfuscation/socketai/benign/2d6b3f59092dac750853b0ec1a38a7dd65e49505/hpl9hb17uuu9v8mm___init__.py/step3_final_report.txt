{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set metadata variables (author, email, version, license) and imports functions and classes from internal modules, likely as part of a package setup or internal library.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments and import statements from internal modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; no untrusted data handling or external interactions are evident.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; the code only imports modules and assigns static strings.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not convey meaningful information; no executable logic or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static assignments and import statements, with nonsensical variable names. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data manipulation is visible. The obfuscation of variable names could be for internal reasons or concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The absence of any code that interacts with external systems or performs data processing suggests this is a benign package setup or internal module reference. The high obfuscation score is justified, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent based solely on this snippet. Malware and active threats are not present; the overall security risk is minimal.",
