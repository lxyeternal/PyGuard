  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated test suite for a chemistry API wrapper. While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (around 0.75), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). Continued review of obfuscated components is recommended, but based on current analysis, the code is likely safe."
