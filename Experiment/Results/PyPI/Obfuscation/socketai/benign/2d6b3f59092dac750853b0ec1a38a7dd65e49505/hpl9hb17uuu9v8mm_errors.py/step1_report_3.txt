  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling various HTTP errors and related error messages, primarily for use in a web-related Python package.",
  "sources": "Class initializers, exception message assignments, and string representations that process error messages and HTTP codes.",
  "sinks": "The __init__ method decodes bytes to strings, but does not write data externally or to network; string representations may output internal error messages.",
  "flows": "Bytes input (possibly from external sources) are decoded to strings, then stored in class attributes; string representations output stored messages.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior. No network connections, cryptic functions, or obfuscated code present. The class hierarchy and error handling seem standard.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from a base exception class, with customized error messages and HTTP status codes. The __init__ method decodes bytes to strings using utf-8 or iso-8859-1, which is standard. The __repr__ and __str__ methods produce string representations of the exceptions. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or obfuscated code. No hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident. The code appears to be a typical error handling setup for a web application or library.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception classes for HTTP error handling, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. It functions as a standard error handling utility for a Python package, with no evidence of malware or security risks.",
