{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP error handling with detailed messages and codes.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from instantiation parameters such as bytes or strings provided during exception creation.",
  "sinks": "None of the code directly writes or transmits data, but potential concerns include the handling of byte input that is decoded.",
  "flows": "Bytes (if provided) are decoded to strings, then stored in object attributes, used in string representation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and variable names; no obvious malicious logic or external network activity. The exception classes are standard, with no malicious payloads or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class, with class-level attributes representing HTTP status messages and codes. The __init__ method carefully decodes byte input to UTF-8 or fallback encoding, which is standard practice. There are no dynamic code executions, network operations, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The code appears to be a typical implementation of error handling with obfuscated naming, possibly to hide the intent or for obfuscation. No signs of malware or malicious behavior are present. The obfuscated class and variable names suggest an attempt to conceal intent but do not themselves indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a set of custom exception classes with obfuscated naming, handling error messages and codes. No malicious or malicious-sounding behavior, network activity, or suspicious code patterns are detected. It appears to be a legitimate error handling module with possible obfuscation for concealment rather than malicious intent.",
