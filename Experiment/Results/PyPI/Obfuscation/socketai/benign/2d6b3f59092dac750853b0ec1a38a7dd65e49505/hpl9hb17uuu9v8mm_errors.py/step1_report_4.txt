  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling, particularly HTTP errors, with some handling of error messages and codes.",
  "sources": "Input data potentially from exception initialization parameters, especially 'zHPFhZYkbEheUbNVtFlUMdoZyyfQsShc', 'http_code', and other arguments in constructors.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit dangerous sinks like network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input data flows from constructor parameters into class attributes, with some decoding of bytes to strings. No further data processing or transfer occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class and variable names; no actual data leaks or network activity; exception classes primarily store error info. The code appears to be standard error class definitions with obfuscated identifiers, no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes for HTTP errors, with some handling of error message strings and status codes. It decodes bytes to strings when necessary, which is standard. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior is present. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be to hinder readability, but no malicious activity is evident. The code only manages error info and does not execute or invoke external commands, access sensitive data, or include backdoors. Overall, the code appears to be a standard, albeit obfuscated, error handling module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of obfuscated but benign error class definitions for HTTP status handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The obfuscation might be for code protection or concealment but does not imply malicious intent.",
