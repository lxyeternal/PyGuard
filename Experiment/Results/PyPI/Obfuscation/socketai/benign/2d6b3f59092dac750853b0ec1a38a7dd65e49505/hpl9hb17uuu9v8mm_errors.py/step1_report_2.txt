{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP error handling, potentially used in a larger API or web service context.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and initializations, especially the __init__ method that processes error messages; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; the code primarily defines exception classes with static error messages.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; code is static class and exception definitions without dynamic data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names, which might indicate an attempt to hide intent; however, no malicious activity or suspicious data handling is present. The code lacks code injection points, external calls, or data exfiltration mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from standard exceptions, with some including custom error messages and HTTP status codes. The constructor handles potential byte-string decoding but does not process or transmit data externally. No input handling, network communication, or cryptographic operations are present. The naming obfuscation could be suspicious, but it appears solely for renaming, not malicious intent. Overall, the code is straightforward, static, and does not contain malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of custom exception classes with obfuscated identifiers. It does not contain malware or malicious behavior. Its structure suggests it's part of a larger application, likely related to HTTP error handling, with no evident security risks or malicious activities.",
