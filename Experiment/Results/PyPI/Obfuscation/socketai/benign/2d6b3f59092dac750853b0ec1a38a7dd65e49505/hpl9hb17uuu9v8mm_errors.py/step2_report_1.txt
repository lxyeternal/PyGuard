  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code is a set of custom exception classes with obfuscated class and variable names.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present.\n- The __init__ methods decode bytes to strings, which is standard.\n- The classes primarily store error messages and HTTP status codes.\n- No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident.\n- Obfuscation appears to be for concealment or stylistic purposes, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n**Purpose:** Define custom exception classes for HTTP error handling with detailed messages and codes.  \n**Analysis:** Accurate; no malicious logic.  \n**Score justification:** Malware score 0 is appropriate.  \n**Obfuscated:** Slightly high (0.7), given the obfuscated class names but no malicious intent.  \n**Risk:** Low (0.2) is appropriate, as it's just error handling.  \n**Conclusion:** Valid, no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n**Purpose:** Similar to above, defining HTTP error classes.  \n**Analysis:** Correct; no external input processing or network activity.  \n**Malware score:** 0 is appropriate.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.7; obfuscation for concealment, not malicious.  \n**Risk:** 0.1 is reasonable.  \n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity, just obfuscated error classes.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n**Purpose:** HTTP error classes for a web package.  \n**Analysis:** Accurate; no suspicious behavior.  \n**Malware score:** 0 is correct.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation).  \n**Risk:** 0.1 is suitable.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n**Purpose:** HTTP error classes with message and code handling.  \n**Analysis:** Correct; no external data leaks or malicious code.  \n**Malware score:** 0 is appropriate.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.8, high due to obfuscated class names, but not malicious.  \n**Risk:** 0.2 is reasonable.  \n**Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n**Purpose:** Similar error classes for HTTP errors.  \n**Analysis:** Accurate; no malicious behavior.  \n**Malware score:** 0 is justified.  \n**Obfuscated:** 0.3, relatively low obfuscation.  \n**Risk:** 0.2 is acceptable.  \n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slightly high (0.7-0.8) due to obfuscated class and variable names, but this does not indicate malicious intent.\n- **Risk score:** Low (0.1-0.2), appropriate for error handling code.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no signs of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** ~0.6 — obfuscation is present but not malicious.\n- **Risk:** ~0.15 — minimal security risk, just error handling.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, obfuscated error handling module with no malicious behavior. The obfuscation might be for concealment or stylistic reasons, but it does not elevate the security risk or malware likelihood.\n\n---\n\n**Recommendations:**  \n- No changes needed to the scores based on the provided analysis.\n- Continue monitoring for any dynamic or network-related code in the larger codebase.\n\n**Summary conclusion:**  \nThe code is benign, primarily defining error classes with obfuscated names, and does not pose malware or security risks.",
