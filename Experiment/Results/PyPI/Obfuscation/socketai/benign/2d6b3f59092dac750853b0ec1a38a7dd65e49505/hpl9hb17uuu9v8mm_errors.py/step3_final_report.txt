{
  "purpose": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes for HTTP error handling, with obfuscated class and variable names, storing error messages and HTTP status codes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters during exception instantiation, particularly bytes that are decoded into strings.",
  "sinks": "The stored error messages and status codes are used in string representations; no external data transfer or network activity occurs.",
  "flows": "Bytes received during initialization are decoded and stored as error messages; these are then used in __repr__ and __str__ methods.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and variable names, but no malicious logic, network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard implementation of custom HTTP error exception classes with byte decoding for error messages. No external calls, network activity, or malicious patterns are present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely stylistic or for concealment, but does not imply malicious intent. The classes serve error handling purposes and do not process untrusted input beyond decoding bytes, which is common. No signs of malware, backdoors, or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated error handling module, with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and does not elevate the malware or security risk scores. The code is standard and safe, primarily serving as custom exception classes for HTTP errors.",
