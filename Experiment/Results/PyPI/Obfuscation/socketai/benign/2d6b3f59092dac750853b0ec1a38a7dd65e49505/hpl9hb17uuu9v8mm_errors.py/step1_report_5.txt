{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for HTTP error handling with descriptive messages and status codes.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from exception arguments and possibly external HTTP response data passed during instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Logging or displaying exception messages; no evident data leaks or untrusted data sinks in the code provided.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of custom exceptions from input bytes (possibly external data) leading to decoding and message construction; no external data flow to sensitive sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure class names and variable names; presence of multiple exception classes; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors; no suspicious external calls or obfuscated code. No malicious or maliciously intended code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes, each representing different HTTP error statuses with preset messages and codes. The base class handles string decoding for exception messages, which could process external byte data, but there are no dangerous operations such as network calls, code execution, or data exfiltration. The class and variable naming are non-descriptive, but this appears to be an obfuscation tactic rather than malicious activity. No suspicious logic, hidden backdoors, or malware patterns are evident. The code's structure suggests it is for error handling in a larger HTTP-based application, with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of custom HTTP exception classes with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for code obfuscation or stylistic reasons. No malware or security vulnerabilities are detected.",
