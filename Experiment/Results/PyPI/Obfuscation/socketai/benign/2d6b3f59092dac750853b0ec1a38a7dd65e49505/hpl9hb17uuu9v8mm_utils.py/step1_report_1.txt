{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for property creation and date/time string parsing.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are strings representing date/time formats passed to parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Data is processed and stored internally; no direct output or external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input strings are parsed into datetime objects without external data transmission or untrusted sink actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code uses obfuscated variable names but functions are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code includes a decorator to create properties with caching behavior, and two functions to parse datetime strings into datetime objects or timedelta objects. The parsing functions determine the format based on the presence of a period in the input string, which is typical for ISO 8601 datetime formats. No external data transmission, network activity, or system modifications are present. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious side-effects are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions for handling datetime parsing and property creation. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
