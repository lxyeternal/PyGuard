  "flows": "Input strings parsed into datetime or timedelta objects within functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a property decorator with caching, and two functions for parsing datetime strings, handling microsecond presence. Variable names are obfuscated but the logic is straightforward and benign. No external data handling, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility code for datetime parsing and property caching. No evidence of malware or malicious behavior. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The scores are consistent with the code's nature.",
