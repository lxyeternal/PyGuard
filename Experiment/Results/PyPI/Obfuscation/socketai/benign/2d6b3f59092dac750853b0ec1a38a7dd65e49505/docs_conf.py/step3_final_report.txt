  "purpose": "Configuration script for Sphinx documentation, setting project metadata, theme, and source linking function.",
  "sources": "Module inspection via sys.modules, source file retrieval via inspect.getsourcefile and inspect.findsource.",
  "sinks": "URL construction for linking source files on GitHub.",
  "flows": "Module info → source file path → URL string.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no malicious code or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code inspects modules to retrieve source file paths and constructs URLs pointing to a GitHub repository. It does not process untrusted input, perform network activity beyond URL generation, or execute external commands. Variable obfuscation appears to be auto-generated or minimized, not malicious. The function is typical for documentation tools linking source code. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious payloads, or security vulnerabilities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard documentation utility for linking source files, with obfuscation likely due to code generation. No malicious activity or security risks are detected.",
