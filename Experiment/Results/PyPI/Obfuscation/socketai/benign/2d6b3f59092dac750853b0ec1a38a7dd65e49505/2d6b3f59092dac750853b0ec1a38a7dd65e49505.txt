The obfuscation and external URL handling are points of concern but do not currently indicate malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, but obfuscation should be monitored if integrated into production environments."

While the obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (around 0.75), and overall security risk is low (~0.2). Continued review of obfuscated components is recommended, but based on current analysis, the code is likely safe."

The obfuscation likely serves proprietary or protective purposes. The network interactions are with trusted endpoints, and no malicious data flows are present. The security assessment should remain cautious due to obfuscation but is overall benign."
