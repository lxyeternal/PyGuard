  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data processing or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Reads 'README.rst' content into a variable, then passes static metadata to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no clear malicious intent but unusual variable naming. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The script conditionally reads 'README.rst' to include in package metadata, which is standard. The variable names are intentionally obscure but do not indicate malicious behavior. No network activity, code injection, or credential handling observed. No suspicious code or behavior in the package setup process.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, obfuscated setup script with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The obscure variable names are unusual but do not indicate malicious activity.",
