  "purpose": "A standard setup.py script for packaging a Python library, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' file, static package metadata assignment.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Reading file content into a variable, then passing static data to setup(). No dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, reading a file but not using its content meaningfully, no code execution or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are present. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent. The variable names are nonsensical but do not execute or conceal malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.3-0.8, risk=0-0.1) are consistent with this benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard for packaging, with superficial obfuscation. No malicious or security issues are evident. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, obfuscation slightly low (~0.3), and overall risk minimal (~0.1). No further action required.",
