  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user inputs, or network sources; potential file/network sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variables, or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources feeding into sinks directly or via intermediate functions, possibly leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns detected; limited code context prevents definitive conclusions.",
  "analysis": "All reports uniformly indicate no evidence of malware or obfuscation, with low security risk scores (0.2) and moderate confidence levels (0.5-0.75). The reasoning aligns with the absence of suspicious patterns and the limited code context. The scores are consistent and justified, reflecting a benign assessment of the dependency.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score and zero malware/obfuscated scores are appropriate given the evidence. No further action or score adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
