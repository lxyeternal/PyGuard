  "purpose": "The code implements a watchdog timer class that periodically checks elapsed time and triggers a callback if a certain delta is exceeded.",
  "sources": "Reads system time via datetime and timestamp functions, and external callback functions provided at instantiation.",
  "sinks": "Invokes callback functions; no data leakage points or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "System time readings (source) trigger callback execution (sink) when time delta exceeds threshold.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive variable names; dynamic thread creation; no hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a watchdog timer class that runs in a separate thread, periodically checking system time against an internal timestamp. It can be paused, resumed, or stopped using thread events. The class relies on system time via datetime.utcnow() multiplied by 1,000,000 for microseconds, which is standard and safe. It triggers a callback function if the elapsed time exceeds a threshold, passing self or self with an identifier. Thread management appears correct, with no suspicious behavior or hardcoded credentials. No malicious network activity, data theft, or backdoors are evident. Use of descriptive logging indicates monitoring but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code implements a standard watchdog timer with thread control mechanisms. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks was identified. The code appears benign, with typical threading and timing logic. Variable naming is obfuscated but does not imply malicious intent. Overall, this seems a safe utility module.",
