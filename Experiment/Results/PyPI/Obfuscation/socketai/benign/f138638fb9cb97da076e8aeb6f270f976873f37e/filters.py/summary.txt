  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, if obfuscated, implementation of Django admin range filters and widgets. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Security risk is minimal, and malware score should remain at 0."
