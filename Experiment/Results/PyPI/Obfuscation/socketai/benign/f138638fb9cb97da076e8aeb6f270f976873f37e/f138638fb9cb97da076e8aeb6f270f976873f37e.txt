The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Security risk is minimal, and malware score should remain at 0."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is mostly benign utility code for Django templates, but the use of a non-existent attribute and obfuscated variable names raise suspicion. The static file handling and CSS injection are standard, but the suspicious attribute suggests potential concealment of malicious intent. The malware score should be low but slightly elevated due to obfuscation and suspicious attribute; the security risk is moderate. Further investigation of the environment and full codebase is recommended before deployment."

      "obfuscated": 0,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign overall, with no confirmed malicious behavior. The suspicion around dynamic execution patterns suggests a moderate security concern, but without concrete evidence, the malware score remains low. Slightly increasing the risk score for the suspicious code patterns is advisable to better reflect potential vulnerabilities."
