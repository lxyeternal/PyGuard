  "purpose": "Obfuscated configuration code performing a Django version check and assigning a configuration string based on version.",
  "sources": "Access to django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe attribute, string variables for version and config.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks, network activity, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Source: django attribute; Sink: conditional assignment of configuration string.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, overwriting version attribute with string, non-standard attribute access.",
  "analysis": "The code imports django, uses obfuscated variable names, and performs a version check with a non-standard attribute. It assigns configuration strings based on the version comparison. No malicious operations such as network calls, file writes, or code execution are present. The obfuscation and attribute naming are suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a configuration or compatibility check, with obfuscation possibly intended to hide its purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated configuration logic with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious behavior. Scores are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscation high (0.7), low security risk (0.2).",
