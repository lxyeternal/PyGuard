{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set some configuration parameters for a Django application, involving version checking and configuration class assignment.",
  "sources": "Reads the Django version via 'django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe' and assigns string values to variables.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data is used that could lead to data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "Reads the Django version, compares it, and assigns configuration strings based on the condition; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, and a version comparison that relies on a non-standard attribute 'goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe' instead of typical 'django.get_version()'. The code uses confusing variable names, which may be intended to obscure intent, but no malicious activity is apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code sets variables with hardcoded strings and checks a version number against a fixed tuple. The variable names are deliberately obfuscated, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or suspicious network activity. The version comparison might be non-standard, but no malicious payload is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but functionally harmless. It appears to be configuration code with no malicious intent or security risks.",
