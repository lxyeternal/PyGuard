{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up some configuration variables, possibly for a Django project, with version checks and configuration module assignment.",
  "sources": "Import statement, variable assignments, and the version check involving 'django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe'.",
  "sinks": "The version comparison and variable assignment do not involve untrusted input or data sinks.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the only flow is setting variables based on a version check.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated variable names that do not match standard conventions; no meaningful or recognizable variable usage; version comparison logic seems non-standard or intentionally obfuscated. The variable 'django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe' appears to be an attribute access that is non-standard and possibly obfuscated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'django', sets a variable with a string, assigns a version string, and compares an attribute of 'django' with a tuple. The attribute name 'goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe' is unusual and likely obfuscated, but it resembles a version attribute. The code assigns a version string to a variable, then compares the Django version attribute to a tuple. These actions do not inherently perform malicious behavior but the obfuscated naming pattern suggests possible attempt to conceal intent. No untrusted data sources, no network activity, no sensitive data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated and uses confusing variable names, but it only performs a version check and configuration assignment typical in Django setup. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not translate into malicious intent in this context.",
