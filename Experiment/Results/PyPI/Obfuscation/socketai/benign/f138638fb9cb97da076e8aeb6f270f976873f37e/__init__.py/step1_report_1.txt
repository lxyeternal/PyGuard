{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up some configuration variables for a Django project, possibly for conditional configuration based on Django version.",
  "sources": "The version comparison `django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe` and the assignment to `goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe`.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks that handle untrusted data or perform unsafe operations.",
  "flows": "The version check reads from `django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe`, and the version variable `QZEePifqwuijAdlLKPJrmdPDCZumCOKU` is assigned to `goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe`.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which could suggest an attempt to hide code purpose. No other suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the Django version via an obfuscated variable. The variable names are deliberately obscure, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The version comparison and variable assignment are typical for configuration scripts. No direct malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version check with obfuscated variable names, likely intended for conditional configuration. There is no clear evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscation warrants caution but is not definitive of malware.",
