{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be related to a Django project configuration or version check, but it is primarily obfuscated.",
  "sources": "Reading the variable 'django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe', which seems to be an attribute of the imported 'django' module.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network calls, file writes, or execution functions are present.",
  "flows": "The code checks a Django version and conditionally assigns a string to a variable, with the version variable being overwritten with a string value.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names, reassigning version variables to strings, and lack of clear purpose or logic; no standard Django version check code pattern is followed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django and performs a version check, but the variable names are intentionally obfuscated. The version variable 'django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe' is read before assignment, indicating potential misuse or obfuscation. The version number is replaced with a string, which can be suspicious if meant to interfere with version logic. There are no network, file, or execution commands. The pattern suggests obfuscation rather than malicious activity, but the intent remains unclear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated with nonsensical variable names and unusual variable reassignments, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obscure the logic. No direct malicious behavior detected, but the obfuscation and unusual structure warrant caution.",
