  "purpose": "The code appears to set the encoding to UTF-8 and imports unicode_literals for compatibility between Python 2 and 3, serving as boilerplate for a Python script.",
  "sources": "The only source is the encoding declaration comment and the import statement, which do not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no data output, network communication, or file writing occurs in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since the code contains only import statements and a comment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and typical, with no anomalies, malicious patterns, or obfuscated code; it is standard boilerplate.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a coding declaration and an import statement. It does not process any data, perform I/O, or execute any logic. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, standard boilerplate for Python scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
