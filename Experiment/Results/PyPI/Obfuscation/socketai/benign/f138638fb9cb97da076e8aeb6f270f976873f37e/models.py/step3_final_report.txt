  "purpose": "Minimal boilerplate code for Python 2/3 compatibility, setting encoding and future import.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only encoding declaration and future import statements.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; code contains only import statements and encoding declaration.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, standard boilerplate with no suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely boilerplate, with no executable logic, data handling, or network activity. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks are present. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0) are consistent with the code's content. Given the absence of operational code or external interactions, there is no basis for higher risk or malware scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign boilerplate with no malicious intent or security issues. The reports' assessments and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
