  "purpose": "This code appears to be the initial lines of a Python script setting encoding and future import directives. It does not perform any specific operation or logic.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths are evident as the code only contains import statements and a coding declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and does not contain any suspicious or unusual constructs. It only sets up the environment for further code.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is a standard Python header. It imports the unicode_literals feature for Python 2/3 compatibility and specifies UTF-8 encoding. There are no functions, variables, or operations that could be malicious. Since this is just a fragment, no malicious or security-related issues are detectable in this limited context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard boilerplate for Python scripts, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
