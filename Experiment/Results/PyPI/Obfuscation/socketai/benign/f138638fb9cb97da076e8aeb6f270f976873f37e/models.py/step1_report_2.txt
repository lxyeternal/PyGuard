  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up the encoding for the script and importing future compatibility features, but it does not perform any specific operations.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading points are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists due to lack of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains a file encoding declaration and a future import; no suspicious or unusual code present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a coding declaration and an import statement for future compatibility. There are no functions, data handling, or control flow that could pose security risks or indicate malicious behavior. It is a standard practice in Python 2/3 compatibility setup and does not show signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving only to specify source file encoding and future compatibility imports without any malicious behavior or security issues.",
