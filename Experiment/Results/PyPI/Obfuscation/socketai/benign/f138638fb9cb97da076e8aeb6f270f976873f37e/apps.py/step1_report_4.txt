{
  "purpose": "Defines a Django application configuration class with internationalization support.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django version number (django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe).",
  "sinks": "Uses translation functions (_), but these are safe and standard; no data sinks found.",
  "flows": "Version check flows into importing the appropriate translation function; no untrusted data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe, pmaPdIETsrovbjNsSzrrcUYXjckWJWni), which are highly obfuscated or nonsensical; no real logic or external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports translation functions based on a Django version check, but the version variable has a suspicious, non-descriptive name. No actual data processing, network activity, or system modification is present. The class defines a configuration with obfuscated attribute names, but no malicious behavior or data leaks are evident. The code appears to be either obfuscated or intentionally convoluted, possibly to hide its true intent, but no malicious actions are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script primarily performs a version check and imports a translation function accordingly. While variable names are suspiciously obfuscated, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The code's obfuscation suggests either intentional concealment or generated code, but it does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage.",
