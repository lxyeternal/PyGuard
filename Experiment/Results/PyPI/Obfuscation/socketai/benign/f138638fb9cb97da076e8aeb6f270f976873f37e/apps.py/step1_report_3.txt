  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with a translatable label.",
  "sources": "django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe (attribute access), imported modules",
  "sinks": "The translation functions _ (gettext_lazy / ugettext_lazy)",
  "flows": "Access of django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe -> conditional import of translation functions -> assignment to class attribute",
  "anomalies": "The variable name 'goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe' appears to be a random, obfuscated string, which is unusual and suggests possible obfuscation or malicious intent. The code itself is a simple class definition with conditional import, but the obfuscated variable raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to determine the Django version by accessing an attribute with a nonsensical name. The conditionally imports translation functions based on the version check, then defines a class with a name and an attribute set using a translation function. The use of an obfuscated variable name and the meaningless attribute name 'pmaPdIETsrovbjNsSzrrcUYXjckWJWni' suggests the code may have been obfuscated to hide malicious intent or complexity. However, no malicious activity such as network connections, file operations, or data exfiltration is present. The code appears to be a standard Django app config with obfuscated naming, which could be for concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Django app configuration with obfuscated variable and attribute names, possibly to hide its intent. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious activity per se. Overall, it looks like an obfuscated, benign Django configuration with no malicious intent detected.",
