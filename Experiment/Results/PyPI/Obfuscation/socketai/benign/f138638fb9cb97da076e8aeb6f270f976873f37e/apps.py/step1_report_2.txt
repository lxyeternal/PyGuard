  "purpose": "Define a Django application configuration class with internationalization support.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version check condition, and string translation functions.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the use of gettext_lazy as _ can be exploited if misused in later code, but here it appears benign.",
  "flows": "Import statements and conditional import lead to assignment of translated strings in the class.",
  "anomalies": "The version check uses an undefined variable 'django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe', which appears to be nonsensical or obfuscated; this is unusual and suspicious. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import Django modules and perform a version check, but the variable used for version comparison is not a standard or recognizable Django attribute, suggesting obfuscation or corruption. The class defines a label with a translated string, which is typical for internationalization. No malicious code, data leaks, or harmful behavior is evident. The strange variable name and version check are suspicious and could indicate an attempt to obfuscate or hide malicious intent, but in isolation, no malicious activity is clear.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely an obfuscated or malformed Django app configuration with no clear malicious intent. The suspicious variable name for version checking warrants caution, but no active malware or security risk is evident from this snippet alone.",
