  "purpose": "Define a Django AppConfig subclass with translated display name.",
  "sources": "Import statements, version check, and translation function usage.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data leakage or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Imports and conditional translation functions used during module load; no data flows involving user input.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., pmaPdIETsrovbjNsSzrrcUYXjckWJWni) and obfuscated-looking code, but no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs conditional imports based on Django version and defines a class with non-descriptive attribute names. The version check correctly adapts to different Django versions. No hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity are present. The code appears to be either obfuscated or intentionally non-descriptive but does not exhibit malicious intent. No dangerous or malicious functions are invoked.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a Django application configuration module with obfuscated variable names and no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The unusual variable names may suggest obfuscation or code generation, but there are no security risks or malicious activities detected.",
