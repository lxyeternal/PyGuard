  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data, environment variables, user inputs, potential dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network connections, file operations, environment variables.",
  "flows": "Input sources to sinks via code execution paths, possibly involving dynamic eval/exec.",
  "anomalies": "Potential dynamic execution (eval, exec), lack of documentation, suspicion of handling sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code shows no explicit malicious payloads but exhibits patterns that could facilitate dynamic code execution, which warrants caution. No obfuscation or malicious signatures are detected. The confidence in benign assessment is moderate to high where no suspicious patterns are observed. The risk score reflects suspicion of dynamic execution but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with slight room for adjustment in the risk and malware scores for suspicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign overall, with no confirmed malicious behavior. The suspicion around dynamic execution patterns suggests a moderate security concern, but without concrete evidence, the malware score remains low. Slightly increasing the risk score for the suspicious code patterns is advisable to better reflect potential vulnerabilities.",
