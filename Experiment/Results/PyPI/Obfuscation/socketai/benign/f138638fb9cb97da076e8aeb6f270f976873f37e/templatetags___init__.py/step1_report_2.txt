  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for performing data processing or utility functions, but without specific context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet, but potential sources could include function parameters, environment variables, or imported modules.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data output functions if present, but none are explicitly shown in the snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows indicated in the provided code segment.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, obfuscated patterns, or unusual constructs are evident. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code was thoroughly reviewed for malicious behavior, including data leakage, insecure practices, or obfuscated malicious intent. No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or malware signatures are identified. The code uses typical Python constructs without signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. As no external or untrusted data sources, sinks, or flows are apparent, and given the lack of malicious patterns, the code seems benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard utility or processing script with no indications of sabotage or malware.",
