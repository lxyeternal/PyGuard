  "purpose": "Configure a Django setting related to ADMIN_RANGEFILTER_NONCE_ENABLED if not already set",
  "sources": "Accessing django.conf.settings to check and set attribute",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "Reads from settings object, potentially writes to settings object",
  "anomalies": "Simple setting check and assignment; no unusual code, obfuscation, or hidden behavior",
  "analysis": "The code checks if the attribute 'ADMIN_RANGEFILTER_NONCE_ENABLED' exists in Django settings. If it does not, it sets this attribute to True. This is a standard configuration pattern used in Django applications to ensure a default setting. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious side effects. No external input is used, and the code does not perform any network or file operations. It is a straightforward configuration snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration setting in Django, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
