  "purpose": "Configure a Django setting related to 'ADMIN_RANGEFILTER_NONCE_ENABLED' if it is not already set.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'settings' object from django.conf and checking for the attribute 'ADMIN_RANGEFILTER_NONCE_ENABLED'.",
  "sinks": "None; the code only sets a configuration attribute without influencing data flow or external interactions.",
  "flows": "Code checks if 'ADMIN_RANGEFILTER_NONCE_ENABLED' exists; if not, it assigns True to it within the settings object.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward setting initialization with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings and ensures that a specific configuration attribute is enabled by default if it is missing. There are no inputs from external untrusted sources, no data processing, and no network or system calls. The code serves as a simple configuration safeguard. It does not contain malicious logic, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. The code is minimal and standard for configuration management.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign configuration setup for Django settings, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
