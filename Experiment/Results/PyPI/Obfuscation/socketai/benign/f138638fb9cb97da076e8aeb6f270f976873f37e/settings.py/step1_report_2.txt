  "flows": "Read from django.conf.settings to check for attribute; set attribute if not present",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious code present. The code performs a simple conditional setting.",
  "analysis": "The code imports Django settings, checks whether a specific attribute is set, and if not, assigns it a value. This is a typical configuration pattern to ensure a feature flag is enabled. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, or data leaks. The code's behavior is straightforward and safe.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign configuration snippet for Django. It ensures a specific feature flag is enabled if not already set. No malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
