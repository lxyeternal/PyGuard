  "conclusion": "The code is mostly benign utility code for Django templates, but the use of a non-existent attribute and obfuscated variable names raise suspicion. The static file handling and CSS injection are standard, but the suspicious attribute suggests potential concealment of malicious intent. The malware score should be low but slightly elevated due to obfuscation and suspicious attribute; the security risk is moderate. Further investigation of the environment and full codebase is recommended before deployment."
