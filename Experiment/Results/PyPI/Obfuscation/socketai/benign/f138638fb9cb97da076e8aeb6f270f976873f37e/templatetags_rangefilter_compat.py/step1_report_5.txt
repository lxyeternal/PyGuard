{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define custom template tags for a Django project, primarily to load static files and embed CSS variables.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django version information and the 'path' parameter for static file loading.",
  "sinks": "The 'path' parameter in the 'aepAaVtTzvkmpdJiLuaYDhHwvIwaMbFU' function is used directly to return a static file URL, which could potentially lead to path manipulation if not properly sanitized.",
  "flows": "The version check determines which static file function to import. The 'path' parameter flows into the '_static' function, which returns a static URL.",
  "anomalies": "The version check condition uses an unusual attribute 'django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe', which appears obfuscated or nonsensical. The variable and function names are obfuscated, suggesting potential code concealment. The conditional in 'mJruZpbRmSdTJedjeSiaIlODKvjSdqEQ' depends on a version check, returning a CSS string or an empty string, which is somewhat unusual.",
  "analysis": "The code employs obfuscated variable and function names, which is suspicious as it makes understanding intent difficult. The version check on an attribute 'django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe' is nonsensical because this attribute does not exist in the Django framework, indicating potential obfuscation or malicious intent to hide behavior. The static file loader function directly returns a static path based on input, which could be exploited if 'path' is not sanitized. The CSS string appears harmless but is included conditionally based on a version check, which may be used to hide malicious payloads. Overall, the code uses obfuscation and conditional logic that could be employed to hide malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscated variable names, nonsensical attribute checks, and conditional logic that could be used to conceal malicious intent. The direct use of the 'path' parameter with static files warrants caution, especially since the version check appears deliberately obscured. There are no overtly malicious actions like network connections or data exfiltration, but the obfuscation and conditional hiding raise security concerns.",
