{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define template tags for a Django project, specifically for static file referencing and returning a CSS variable block.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the django package, checking the version, and from the local context for the static files via imported functions and a hardcoded string containing CSS variables.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the return of static file paths through the _static function, and the output of CSS variables, which could potentially be injected into templates or styles.",
  "flows": "Input from Django version check influences which static function is imported; the path argument in the static tag is used to return static files; the CSS string is conditionally returned based on Django version.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, uses version checks to determine code paths, and includes a CSS string with no apparent direct malicious intent. The version check involving an oddly named variable suggests obfuscation or intentional concealment, but no malicious behavior is evident. No user input, environment variables, or network interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines two template tags: one to return static files and another to conditionally return CSS styles. It employs version checks and imports modules based on Django's version, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The obfuscation of variable names could indicate an attempt to conceal intent, but the operations performed are standard for Django templates. No suspicious network activity, credential handling, or other malicious actions are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign Django utility module for static files and styles, with obfuscated variable names that could raise suspicion but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of malware or security risks within the provided snippet.",
