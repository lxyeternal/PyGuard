{
  "purpose": "The code defines template tags for a Django project, including static file referencing and returning a CSS string based on Django version.",
  "sources": "Django version check, import statements, and the function parameters (path).",
  "sinks": "Return statements for static file path and CSS string; the static file path is returned directly from _static.",
  "flows": "Input parameter 'path' flows into the '_static' function, which is returned by the template tag function.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; conditional import based on Django version; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code conditionally imports a static file function based on Django version, then exposes it as a template tag. It also defines a CSS snippet that is returned conditionally based on Django version. No data leakage, code injection, or suspicious behavior is detected. Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent; they seem to be generated or intentionally obscure. No external network activity or system modification is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard Django template tag setup with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The overall structure suggests code obfuscation rather than malicious intent.",
