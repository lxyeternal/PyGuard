{
  "purpose": "Defines Django template tags for static files and CSS snippets with version-based conditional imports.",
  "sources": "Version check attribute `django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe`, input parameter `path` in static tag.",
  "sinks": "Return of static file path via `_static`, static CSS string, potential use of 'path' parameter.",
  "flows": "Version attribute check influences import; static tag returns `_static(path)`; CSS string returned based on version check.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-existent Django attribute `django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe`; obfuscated variable names; conditional logic based on suspicious attribute; static path used directly without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs version checks to select import paths and defines template tags for static files and CSS. The variable names are obfuscated, and the attribute `django.goWoUpgQccmRKLoCrgXFMOSTHWdocJNe` does not exist in Django, indicating obfuscation or malicious intent. The static tag returns a static file path, which could be exploited if 'path' is not sanitized. The CSS string is static and harmless. Overall, the code appears benign but employs obfuscation and suspicious attribute checks that could conceal malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is mostly benign utility code for Django templates, but the use of a non-existent attribute and obfuscated variable names raise suspicion. The static file handling and CSS injection are standard, but the suspicious attribute suggests potential concealment of malicious intent. The malware score should be low but slightly elevated due to obfuscation and suspicious attribute; the security risk is moderate. Further investigation of the environment and full codebase is recommended before deployment.",
