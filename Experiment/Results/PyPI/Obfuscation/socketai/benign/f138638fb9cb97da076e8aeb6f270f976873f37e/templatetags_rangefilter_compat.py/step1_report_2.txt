{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide template tags for a Django application, specifically for static file handling and CSS injection.",
  "sources": "The code reads the Django version to determine which static file module to import, and also defines a CSS string constant.",
  "sinks": "The static file path returned by the function could be used in templates, but no direct data sink or untrusted data processing is evident.",
  "flows": "The version check influences the imported static module, and the static tag function returns a static file path; the CSS string is returned conditionally based on Django version.",
  "anomalies": "The version check uses an obfuscated variable name and a suspiciously verbose version check. No actual code injection, data leakage, or malicious payload is present.",
  "analysis": "The code uses dynamic import logic based on Django version, which is standard in compatibility layers. The variable names are overly complex and obfuscated, but no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The CSS string is a static constant and is conditionally returned; no external data is processed or leaked. The overall structure suggests obfuscation or code complexity rather than malicious intent. There are no network calls, no credential handling, and no code injection mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely intended to provide compatibility for static file handling and CSS injection within Django templates. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or malicious data flows. The obfuscated variable names may suggest an attempt to hide complexity, but no malicious activity is detected.",
