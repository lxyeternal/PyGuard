{
  "purpose": "The code provides a deprecated import warning and imports specific functions from a local module named 'filters'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the import statements, warnings module, and the local '.filters' module.",
  "sinks": "Potential sink is the import statement, which could be exploited if the module path or imported names are maliciously manipulated, though this is unlikely in this static context.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow from sources to sinks; the code primarily issues a warning and imports functions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated warning message and obscure function names ('nexByuHiWVjvuKkxjsaGuVUcRRNCwgIu', 'cGWpsjPdhcmkYqlhMVpYrlsWjEVjucjZ'), which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent, especially if these functions are used maliciously elsewhere. The warning message contains an encoded string which looks unusual but is simply a warning message.",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning with a seemingly random string, then imports two functions with non-descriptive, obfuscated names from a local module. There is no indication of malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity. The obfuscated function names and unusual warning message could be suspicious but might also be benign. The presence of a deprecated warning suggests maintenance or compatibility concerns rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard deprecation warning and module import with obfuscated identifiers. No direct malicious behavior is evident; the obfuscation could be suspicious but may also be unintentional or harmless. Overall, the likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
