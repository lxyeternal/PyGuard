  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code snippet, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- Issues a deprecation warning via `warnings.warn()`, with a message containing a suspicious string `'nkbpfpKCFwlzTjYDkzYpvNVtOeEgERAA=2'`.\n- Imports two obfuscated identifiers (`nexByuHiWVjvuKkxjsaGuVUcRRNCwgIu`, `cGWpsjPdhcmkYqlhMVpYrlsWjEVjucjZ`) from a local module `.filters`.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues in the code:\n- The code does **not** perform any malicious actions.\n- The warning message contains an unusual string, which could be obfuscated or encoded.\n- The imported identifiers are long, nonsensical, and obfuscated, suggesting potential concealment or code obfuscation.\n\n### Logical flaws or mistakes:\n- No functional logic or data processing is shown; the code is mainly for deprecation notification and import.\n- The obfuscated names and strings are suspicious, but not inherently malicious.\n\n### Scores review:\n- **Malware score:** Generally low (around 0.1-0.2) across reports, consistent with benign code but with some suspicion due to obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Ranges from 0.4 to 0.8, reflecting suspicion about the naming and strings.\n- **Risk score:** Mostly low (0.1-0.3), which aligns with the code's benign appearance but considers the obfuscation as a potential red flag.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n- The scores seem reasonable given the evidence. No report assigns a high malware score (>0.5), which is appropriate.\n- The obfuscated scores are higher, reflecting suspicion but not confirmed maliciousness.\n\n---\n\n### Specific observations:\n- The suspicious string `'nkbpfpKCFwlzTjYDkzYpvNVtOeEgERAA=2'` looks like base64 or similar encoding, possibly hiding malicious data or intent.\n- The obfuscated function names could be generated or intentionally obscured to evade static analysis.\n- The code itself does not show any malicious behavior—no network activity, no data handling, no system modifications.\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- The code appears primarily to issue a deprecation warning and import obfuscated functions.\n- The obfuscation and unusual string in the warning are red flags but not definitive proof of malicious intent.\n- No evidence suggests active malware or exploitation in this snippet.\n\n---\n\n### Final estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** ~0.2 (slightly elevated due to obfuscation, but no direct malicious activity observed)\n- **Obfuscated:** ~0.7 (high, given the nonsensical variable names and suspicious string)\n- **Risk:** ~0.3 (moderate, mainly due to obfuscation and suspicious strings, but no active malicious behavior)\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis code is suspicious mainly because of obfuscation and unusual strings but does not demonstrate malicious activity in its current form. It warrants further review of the actual contents of the `.filters` module and the context in which these identifiers are used.\n\n**Critical note:** Do not assume maliciousness solely based on obfuscation; further dynamic analysis or source code review of the imported module is recommended.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendation:** Maintain a cautious stance, monitor for further malicious indicators, and review the full codebase for hidden behaviors.",
