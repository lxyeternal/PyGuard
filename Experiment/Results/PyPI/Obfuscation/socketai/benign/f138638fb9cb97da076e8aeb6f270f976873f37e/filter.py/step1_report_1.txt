{
  "purpose": "This code appears to issue a deprecation warning about importing from the 'filter' module and suggests using the 'filters' module instead. It also imports specific functions or variables from the 'filters' module.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the module import statements, specifically the import of functions or variables from the '.filters' module.",
  "sinks": "The import statement itself does not have a direct sink, but if the imported functions or variables are used later in the code (not shown), they could be potential points where untrusted or malicious data might be processed.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing specific functions or variables from the '.filters' module following the deprecation warning, but there is no explicit data flow or untrusted data handling shown in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The warning message includes a suspicious string 'nkbpfpKCFwlzTjYDkzYpvNVtOeEgERAA=2' which appears to be a random or obfuscated string, possibly base64-encoded or deliberately obscured. The imported identifiers 'nexByuHiWVjvuKkxjsaGuVUcRRNCwgIu' and 'cGWpsjPdhcmkYqlhMVpYrlsWjEVjucjZ' are long, seemingly random strings, suggesting obfuscation or generated names, which is unusual and warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code only issues a deprecation warning and imports two items with obscure names from a local module. The presence of suspicious string literals and non-descriptive variable names could indicate obfuscation. There are no evident malicious actions such as network activity, system modification, or data exfiltration. The code itself is simple and does not perform any malicious operation. However, the obfuscated identifiers and unusual string in the warning message could be indicative of attempts to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality. Overall, the code appears benign based on the given snippet, but the obfuscation raises a slight concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a benign deprecation warning and imports obfuscated identifiers from a local module. The suspicious string and obscure variable names could suggest obfuscation, but there is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risk in this fragment alone.",
