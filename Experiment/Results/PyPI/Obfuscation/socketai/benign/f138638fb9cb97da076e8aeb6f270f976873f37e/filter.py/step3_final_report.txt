  "purpose": "Deprecation warning issuance and import of obfuscated functions from a local module",
  "sources": "The warning message string containing suspicious data; the import statements with obfuscated identifiers",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported functions or data within the module, which could lead to malicious behavior if the imported code is malicious",
  "flows": "Warning message with embedded string potentially used for obfuscation; imported functions possibly invoked elsewhere in the codebase",
  "anomalies": "Use of a suspicious string 'nkbpfpKCFwlzTjYDkzYpvNVtOeEgERAA=2'; obfuscated-looking variable names; deprecation warning with unusual message",
  "analysis": "The code issues a deprecation warning with a suspicious string that appears encoded or obfuscated. It imports two functions or variables with nonsensical, obfuscated names from a local module. No malicious actions such as network activity, file modifications, or data exfiltration are evident. The obfuscation and unusual string are red flags but could also be legitimate obfuscation or proprietary code. Malware scoring remains low (around 0.15-0.2) due to lack of active malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are higher (~0.7) reflecting suspicion. Overall risk is moderate (~0.25), primarily due to obfuscation concerns, but no direct malicious activity is confirmed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in function but employs obfuscation techniques and contains suspicious strings that warrant caution. No active malicious behavior is evident, but further review of the imported module and context is recommended to rule out malicious intent.",
