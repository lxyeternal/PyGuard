{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific error classes and modules related to 'starlark_go', likely for configuring or using the Starlark language in a Python environment.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'starlark_go.errors' and 'starlark_go.starlark_go', which are likely external dependencies or local modules providing error classes and core functionalities.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks are present. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "The imported classes and functions are used for configuration and error handling; there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The imported error classes have obfuscated, non-descriptive names, which could be an attempt to hide their purpose, but this alone is not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behavior identified.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import statement from a package named 'starlark_go'. The error class names are obfuscated but are imported and included in __all__, suggesting they are part of the package's public API. The core functionality appears to be related to configuring or using 'Starlark', a build language, with no evidence of malicious intent or suspicious behavior. No data handling, network activity, or code injection is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a module import setup for a 'starlark_go' package. The obfuscated class names alone do not indicate malicious behavior, and there are no other suspicious elements.",
