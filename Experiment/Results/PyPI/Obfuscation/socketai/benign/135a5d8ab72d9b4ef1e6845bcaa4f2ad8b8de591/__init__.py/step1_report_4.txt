  "purpose": "Import specific error classes and functions from the 'starlark_go' library and define the module's public API.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'starlark_go.errors' and 'starlark_go.starlark_go', as well as the module's own definitions.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external communication observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; the code only imports modules and defines an API list.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random, non-descriptive class names in the error imports; no actual code execution or data handling shown.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements with obfuscated-looking class names. It imports specific classes from external modules and sets an __all__ list. There are no function definitions, no data processing, no dynamic code execution, or network operations. The obfuscated class names could suggest code designed to hide malicious intent, but they are merely imported classes from a library. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module that imports certain classes and defines its public API. The obfuscated class names in the imports do not inherently indicate malicious intent but are unusual. Overall, there are no signs of malware or security risks based on this fragment.",
