  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package or module",
  "sources": "Hardcoded assignment of version string and version tuple",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations present",
  "flows": "Assignment of the version string to the version tuple",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names that do not convey meaningful intent, minimal clarity in code structure",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable and also defines a version tuple with the same version. The variable names are nonsensical, which may suggest obfuscation. However, there are no inputs, outputs, or data flows indicating malicious intent. The code is simplistic and serves the purpose of version identification. No suspicious or malicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version assignment with obfuscated variable names, likely for minimal obfuscation or stylistic reasons. No malware or security risks identified.",
