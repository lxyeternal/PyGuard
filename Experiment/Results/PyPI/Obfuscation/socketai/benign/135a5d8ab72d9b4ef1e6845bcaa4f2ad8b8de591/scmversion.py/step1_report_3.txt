  "purpose": "Assign version information to variables",
  "sources": "Assignment statements setting version and version_tuple variables",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data handling or output functions",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources; simple variable assignments",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names with seemingly random strings; no clear purpose or documentation",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns hardcoded version strings and tuples to variables with obfuscated names. There are no input, output, or data handling operations. The variable names appear intentionally obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code is minimal, simple, and does not perform any suspicious actions. No indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code merely assigns version information to variables with obfuscated names, with no malicious or security-threatening behavior. The unusual variable names may suggest obfuscation, but they do not constitute malicious activity.",
