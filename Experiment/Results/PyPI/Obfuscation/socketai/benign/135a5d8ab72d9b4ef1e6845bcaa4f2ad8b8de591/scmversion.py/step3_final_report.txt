  "purpose": "Assigns version information to variables with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments; no input/output or external data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, static, and assigns version info to variables with obfuscated names. No inputs, outputs, network activity, or dynamic behavior are present. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. No code injection, data leaks, or malicious functions are detected. The absence of external data or behavior indicates a benign purpose. The obfuscated variable names do not, in themselves, imply malicious intent. The malware score should remain at 0, and the security risk is minimal, around 0.1, primarily due to obfuscation but no actual threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define version information with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The current scores are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is superficial, and security risk is negligible.",
