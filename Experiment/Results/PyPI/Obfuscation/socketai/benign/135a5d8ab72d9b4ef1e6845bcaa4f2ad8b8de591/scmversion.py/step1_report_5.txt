  "flows": "No flow from source to sink as no external data handling occurs",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking variable names that seem meaningless, but no actual malicious behavior is evident",
  "analysis": "The code assigns string and tuple values to variables with nonsensical names. There are no imports, no function calls, no data processing, and no external interactions. The pattern appears to be obfuscation or placeholder code with no malicious intent. The code solely defines version information, which is common in Python packages, but the variable names are unusual and potentially intentionally obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and only assigns version information to variables with unusual names. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident. The obfuscated variable names could be an attempt at concealment, but the code itself is benign.",
