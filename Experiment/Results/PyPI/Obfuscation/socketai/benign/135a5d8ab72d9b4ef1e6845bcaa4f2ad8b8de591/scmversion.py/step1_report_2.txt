  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "N/A, only variable assignments with static values",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking variable names that do not serve a clear purpose; no clear reason for such naming conventions",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static string and tuple values to variables with non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated variable names. There are no input functions, external data reads, or dynamic code execution. The assignments are straightforward and appear to set version information. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The variable names could suggest obfuscation, but without additional context, they do not inherently indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code performs simple variable assignments with static data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of static variable assignments for version info. No malicious or security-related issues are detected.",
