  "sources": "No external input or data sources are used",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are assigned static values",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names that are assigned static version strings; no malicious behavior detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines two variables with non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated names. Both variables are assigned version information: one as a string '1.0.0' and the other as a tuple (1, 0, 0). There are no input sources, no data processing, no external data, and no suspicious functions or network activity. The only potential concern is the obfuscated variable names, which could suggest hidden intent, but given the static assignments, this appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply assigns version information to variables with obfuscated names. No malicious activity, data leaks, or security issues are evident. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious behavior, and the code is benign.",
