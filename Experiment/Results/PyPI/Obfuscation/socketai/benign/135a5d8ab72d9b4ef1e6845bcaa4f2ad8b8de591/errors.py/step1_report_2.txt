{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and data structures related to error handling, likely for a larger application or library.",
  "sources": "Class constructors, attribute assignments, string representations.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is used maliciously or leads to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Initialization of exceptions and data objects without external input handling or data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an oddly named class attribute ('zpjVXHVdbBGiJMMPenAzqAxBdjnZhMKU') with a static string value. The class 'EBdwWTOkJaULyADljNyozesAiJsJliPq' contains only a single static string attribute, which appears unnecessary. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, with additional attributes for detailed error information. The class 'EBdwWTOkJaULyADljNyozesAiJsJliPq' has a static attribute with no apparent functional purpose. No input handling, network operations, or external data usage is present. The naming appears obfuscated, but the structure remains straightforward and harmless. No malicious or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of harmless class and data structure definitions used for error handling. It does not include any malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The static attribute in one class is unnecessary but not malicious.",
