  "purpose": "Define custom error classes and data structures for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "Class initializers and static class variables, no external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data leaks; static string is harmless.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code is purely structural.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of heavily obfuscated class names and static string attribute with random string.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names and a static string attribute. No external data handling, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The static string may be an obfuscation artifact or placeholder. Obfuscation is high but does not indicate active malicious behavior. No evidence of data leaks, code injection, or sabotage. The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated error handling module, possibly generated or intentionally obscured.",
  "conclusion": "The code is structurally benign, with obfuscation that raises suspicion but no active malicious intent. Static string attributes are unnecessary but harmless. Overall, no malicious activity or security risks are evident.",
