  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and data structures for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external output mechanisms are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of a seemingly random string attribute 'zpjVXHVdbBGiJMMPenAzqAxBdjnZhMKU' in a class, which appears to be obfuscated or meaningless. No actual malicious code such as network activity, file manipulation, or credential handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions and data containers. All classes inherit from Exception or are simple data holders. No input handling, external data sources, or output sinks are present. The random string attribute in the last class looks suspicious but appears to serve no purpose or malicious intent. There is no behavior, network activity, or obfuscated logic beyond the unusual attribute.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining exception and data classes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The random attribute may be an obfuscation or placeholder, but it does not exhibit malicious intent or functionality.",
