  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "No input or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or malicious actions are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names (e.g., uuMlSZwUHnOPoSToVLiExyjOKTZFXlbF), which may indicate an attempt to hide intent. The class EBdwWTOkJaULyADljNyozesAiJsJliPq contains an unused class attribute with a seemingly random string, which could be a dead code or obfuscation technique.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions, with heavily obfuscated class names. No data input, network operations, file handling, or other typical malicious behavior is present. The obscure naming pattern raises suspicion but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. The presence of a random attribute string in one class could be an obfuscation or dead code. Overall, no evidence of malicious activity or malware is found in the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for obscurity. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident. It appears to be standard error handling code with obfuscation tactics that do not imply malicious intent.",
