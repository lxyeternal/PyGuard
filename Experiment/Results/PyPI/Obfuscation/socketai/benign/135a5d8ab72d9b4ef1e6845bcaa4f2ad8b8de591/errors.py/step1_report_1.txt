{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling and error information encapsulation.",
  "sources": "None (the code only defines classes and constants).",
  "sinks": "None, as there are no data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, no data flow or external data processing occurs.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an unusual hard-coded string 'KjErSKcZONSNwwUVSroFpfJsmNDDvALf' in a class variable; no other suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code exclusively defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception class. The classes store error details such as messages, filenames, line and column numbers, and backtraces. One class contains a hard-coded string, which is atypical but not malicious. There is no evidence of data leakage, external data handling, or malicious activity. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious control flow are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely structural, defining custom error classes for error handling with no malicious behavior or security risks identified. The hard-coded string is unusual but not harmful. Overall, the code appears benign.",
