  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom exception classes for error handling.\n- **Findings:** No external data handling, no malicious activity. The only anomaly is the static string in `EBdwWTOkJaULyADljNyozesAiJsJliPq`.\n- **Assessment:** The code is purely structural, with no malicious behavior. The string is unusual but harmless.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Obfuscated not necessarily high, since the code is straightforward aside from naming.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Defines custom error classes and data structures.\n- **Findings:** Similar to report 1, with an extra static string attribute in a class. No external data or malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The static string attribute is unnecessary but not malicious. Obfuscation is minimal.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0.4 (due to obfuscated class names), Obfuscated score is reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable; no change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar class definitions, but with heavily obfuscated class names and a static string attribute.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscation is high, and the static string could be a marker or dead code.\n- **Assessment:** While obfuscation raises suspicion, there's no evidence of malicious activity. The code is static and doesn't perform any malicious actions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0.2 is justified, considering obfuscation. Risk = 0.3 is acceptable given obfuscation but no active malicious behavior.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable; no change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Same pattern, obfuscated class names, static string attribute.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, just obfuscation.\n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation and static string are suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1, obfuscated = 0.7. Slightly high obfuscation score but justified.\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent; no change.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Similar class definitions, static string attribute, no external data.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscation present but no malicious activity.\n- **Assessment:** The static string is suspicious but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, risk = 0, obfuscated = 0.2. Slightly low obfuscation, consistent with code.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware scores** are low or zero across all reports, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation scores** are higher in reports 3 and 4, justified by the obfuscated class names and static string attributes.\n- **Risk scores** are low, reflecting the lack of active vulnerabilities or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final personal assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 — the code is purely structural with no malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 — due to obfuscated class names and static strings, especially in reports 3 and 4.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — minimal, mainly due to obfuscation, but no active vulnerabilities.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current scores are reasonable. The static string attributes and obfuscated class names are suspicious but not malicious. The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated error handling module.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Always consider context; if this code is part of a larger, obfuscated package, further review is warranted. But based solely on these snippets, no malicious activity is evident.",
