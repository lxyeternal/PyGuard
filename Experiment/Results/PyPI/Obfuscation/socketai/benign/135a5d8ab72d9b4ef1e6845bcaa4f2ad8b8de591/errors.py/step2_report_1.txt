  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and security risks, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Define custom error classes.\n- Analysis: No data flow, no external input/output, no malicious behavior.\n- Anomalies: Presence of an unusual hard-coded string ('KjErSKcZONSNwwUVSroFpfJsmNDDvALf') in a class variable.\n- Conclusion: The code is purely structural, benign, with no malicious activity.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Define error classes and data structures.\n- Analysis: No external data handling, no malicious behavior.\n- Anomalies: Static string attribute in one class, unnecessary but harmless.\n- Conclusion: Harmless class definitions, minimal obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0.4, risk=0 — reasonable, given obfuscation but no malicious intent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Define error classes.\n- Analysis: Obfuscated class names, presence of static string attribute with a random string, which raises suspicion.\n- Anomalies: Obfuscated class names, static string attribute that could be dead code or an obfuscation tactic.\n- Potential concern: Obfuscation and random string suggest an attempt to hide intent, but no active malicious behavior.\n- Conclusion: Possibly part of obfuscated or malicious code, but no direct evidence.\n- Scores: malware=0.2, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.3 — seems reasonable given the suspicion.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Similar to above, error class definitions.\n- Analysis: Obfuscated class names, static random string attribute.\n- Conclusion: No malicious activity, likely obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.1 — acceptable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Same as above.\n- Analysis: Obfuscated class names, random string attribute.\n- Conclusion: No active malicious behavior, just obfuscation.\n- Scores: malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, risk=0 — consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no evidence of malicious activity. The highest malware suspicion is 0.2, which is still low.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Obfuscation is present in most reports, especially in reports 3 and 4, with high obfuscated scores (~0.7-0.8). Given the obfuscated class names and random static strings, a higher obfuscated score is justified.\n- **Risk Score:** Overall, the code is structural, with no active malicious behavior. The only concern is obfuscation, which is a common tactic to hide malicious intent but not proof of it here.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Malware:** 0.1 (low, no evidence of malicious payloads)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (due to obfuscated class names and static strings)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (minor, due to obfuscation, but no active threat)\n\nThis conservative estimate reflects the suspicious obfuscation but confirms the absence of actual malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The code is primarily a set of custom exception classes, some obfuscated.\n- No malicious behavior, data leaks, or active security risks are evident.\n- The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.\n\n**Final scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.1\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese are aligned with the evidence and analysis above.",
