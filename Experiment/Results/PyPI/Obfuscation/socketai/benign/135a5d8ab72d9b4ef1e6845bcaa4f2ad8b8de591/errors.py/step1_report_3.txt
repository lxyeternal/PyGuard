  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with specific attributes for error handling and reporting.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read within this code.",
  "sinks": "No data is written to external systems, network, or storage within this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only initializes classes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names (e.g., uuMlSZwUHnOPoSToVLiExyjOKTZFXlbF) and a class with a seemingly random string attribute (zpjVXHVdbBGiJMMPenAzqAxBdjnZhMKU). The code appears deliberately obfuscated or generated, which can be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from Exception or basic object, with no external data handling, network activity, or file operations. The class names are obfuscated, and the attribute 'zpjVXHVdbBGiJMMPenAzqAxBdjnZhMKU' is assigned a seemingly random string. These features are typical in malicious or obfuscated code aiming to hide intent. However, there are no active malicious behaviors such as network communication, file modification, or data exfiltration. The code's structure suggests it is either an obfuscated error handling module or part of a larger, potentially malicious, package designed to hide functionality.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily defines custom exception classes with obfuscated identifiers. While the obfuscation raises suspicion about intent, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The code by itself appears benign but could be part of a larger, potentially malicious package. Its obfuscated nature warrants caution.",
