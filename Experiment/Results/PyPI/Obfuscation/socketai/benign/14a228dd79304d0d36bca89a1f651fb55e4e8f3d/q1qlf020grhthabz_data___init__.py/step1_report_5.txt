{
  "purpose": "The code provides a function to load and cache JSON data from files within a specific directory structure.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from JSON files located in a directory relative to the script's location, based on a 'name' parameter.",
  "sinks": "The data is loaded into memory via json.load; no direct sink like network or external storage is used in this snippet.",
  "flows": "The 'get' function reads a filename derived from 'name', loads the JSON content, and caches it in a dictionary for future calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. The code performs standard file I/O and JSON parsing.",
  "analysis": "The script initializes a directory path based on the script location, then defines a cache dictionary. The 'get' function checks if data for a given name is already cached; if not, it constructs a file path using the provided name, reads the corresponding JSON file with UTF-8 encoding, loads its content, caches it, and returns the data. There are no obfuscated elements, no suspicious dynamic execution, or data exfiltration mechanisms. It appears to be a straightforward utility for reading JSON files with caching.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple JSON loader with caching, designed for local file access. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
