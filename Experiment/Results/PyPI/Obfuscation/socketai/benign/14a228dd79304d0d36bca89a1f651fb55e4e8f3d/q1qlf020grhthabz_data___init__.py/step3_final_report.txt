  "purpose": "Load and cache JSON files from a directory relative to the script, based on a provided name.",
  "sources": "The open() function reading a JSON file constructed from the 'name' parameter and the filesystem path.",
  "sinks": "The in-memory cache dictionary and the returned JSON data.",
  "flows": "The 'get' function checks cache; if not present, constructs a file path from 'name', reads the JSON file, caches it, and returns the data.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of validation or sanitization of 'name' before using it to build the file path, which could lead to directory traversal if exploited.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward JSON loader with caching, with no obfuscation or malicious behavior. The main security concern is the absence of input validation on 'name', allowing potential directory traversal. All reports correctly identify this risk but do not find malicious activity. Malware score is 0; obfuscation score is 0; security risk score is approximately 0.2 due to the validation issue. The code is benign but could be improved by sanitizing 'name'.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign JSON loader with a minor security concern regarding input validation. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the potential for directory traversal if 'name' is manipulated. Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
