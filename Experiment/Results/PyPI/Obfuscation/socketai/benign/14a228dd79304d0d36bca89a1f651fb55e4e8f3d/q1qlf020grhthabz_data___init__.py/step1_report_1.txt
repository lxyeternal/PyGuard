  "purpose": "Load and cache JSON files from a specified directory based on a given name.",
  "sources": "The function reads JSON files from the file system when a specific name is requested.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations using open() with dynamically constructed file paths based on input 'name'.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' is used to construct a file path; if not cached, the file is read and loaded into memory, then returned.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or obfuscated code; dynamic file path based on user input could pose a risk if not properly validated, but no explicit malicious activity is detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a module-level cache and a function 'get' to load JSON files from a directory relative to the script location. It dynamically constructs file paths based on user-provided 'name' input, reads the corresponding JSON file if not cached, and stores it in a cache for future access. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is evident. Usage of os.path.join and json.load is standard. There are no suspicious network operations or obfuscated code. The main concern is the potential for directory traversal if 'name' is not validated, but that is a common risk rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a simple JSON loader with caching, with no indications of malicious behavior or malware. The only minor security consideration is to ensure 'name' input cannot be manipulated for directory traversal, which is not currently addressed but does not imply malicious intent.",
