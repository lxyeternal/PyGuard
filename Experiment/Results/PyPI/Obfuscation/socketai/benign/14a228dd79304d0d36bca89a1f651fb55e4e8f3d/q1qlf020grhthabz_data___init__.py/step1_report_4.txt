{
  "purpose": "Load JSON data from files in a specified directory when requested by name.",
  "sources": "The function 'get' reads JSON files from the filesystem based on the provided name.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to memory cache; no external network or system calls with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Input 'name' used to construct file path, then JSON data is loaded and stored in cache for future use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no unusual language features; caching mechanism is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a simple data loader that reads JSON files from a specific directory, caching the results in memory to avoid repeated disk reads. There are no indications of obfuscation, malicious code, or data exfiltration mechanisms. The file path is constructed dynamically but from a controlled directory. There are no network operations, system modifications, or credential handling. Overall, this appears to be a standard, benign data loading utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign JSON loader with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It functions as a cache-enabled file reader for JSON data, with no suspicious operations detected.",
