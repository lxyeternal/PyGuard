{
  "purpose": "The code loads JSON data from files based on provided names, caching the loaded data for reuse.",
  "sources": "The code reads files from the filesystem using the 'name' parameter to construct file paths.",
  "sinks": "File reading operation; no data is written or transmitted externally.",
  "flows": "The 'get' function takes a 'name', constructs a file path, reads the JSON file, and caches its content; subsequent calls retrieve from cache.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious file access patterns, or unusual code behavior detected. No obfuscated or malicious code present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function 'get' that reads JSON files from a specific directory relative to the script's location. It caches loaded JSON data in a dictionary to avoid redundant file reads. The file path is constructed dynamically based on the input parameter 'name'. There are no indications of malicious intent, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The code appears to perform standard data loading with caching.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward implementation of a JSON loader with caching; it does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
