  "purpose": "Importing 'tags' from the 'language_tags.tags' module, likely for use in language or tag processing.",
  "sources": "Import statement at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows observable within this single line of code.",
  "anomalies": "The import appears standard; no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded credentials are evident. Cannot determine actual usage or data flow from this isolated line.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of an import statement, which by itself does not execute any malicious activity. The module 'language_tags.tags' could be a legitimate library or part of a larger project. Without additional context or code, there are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. Since no further code is provided, the analysis cannot extend beyond this import statement.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward import statement with no evident malicious intent or security issues based solely on this line. It appears to be a standard module import, with no suspicious behavior or malicious patterns detected.",
