  "purpose": "The code imports the 'tags' component from the 'language_tags.tags' module, likely for language or tagging functionalities.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no external data input or reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident; the code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs a static import.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected; the code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement with no dynamic execution, data handling, or malicious indicators. All reports correctly identify its benign nature. Malware score is 0, obfuscated score is 0, and security risk score is very low (0.1), reflecting minimal concern. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious behavior justify these scores. No further analysis or context suggests any security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign import statement with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
