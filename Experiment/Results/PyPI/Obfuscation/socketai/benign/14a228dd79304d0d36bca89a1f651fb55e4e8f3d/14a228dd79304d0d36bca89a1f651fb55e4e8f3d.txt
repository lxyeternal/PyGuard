      "conclusion": "The script is heavily obfuscated and syntactically invalid, but lacks evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and malformed parameters are suspicious but do not confirm malicious intent. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). It should be reviewed further for intent, especially if used in production, but based on current static analysis, it appears benign."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a language tag utility module with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious intent or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not elevate the malware or risk scores. The static analysis indicates a benign purpose, and the low malware score is appropriate."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated language subtag validation and formatting utility. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data theft, network activity, or system compromise. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is likely intended for code concealment or protection. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, with a very low malware likelihood."

      "conclusion": "The code is a language subtag validation and formatting utility with obfuscated code style and recursive data handling. No malicious activity is evident, but the recursive 'Preferred-Value' processing could be exploited for resource exhaustion if fed malicious data. Overall, it appears benign with low security risk, requiring standard precautions such as recursion limits and exception message sanitization."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign JSON loader with a minor security concern regarding input validation. No malware or obfuscation detected. The risk score of 0.2 is appropriate given the potential for directory traversal if 'name' is manipulated. Overall, the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's behavior."
