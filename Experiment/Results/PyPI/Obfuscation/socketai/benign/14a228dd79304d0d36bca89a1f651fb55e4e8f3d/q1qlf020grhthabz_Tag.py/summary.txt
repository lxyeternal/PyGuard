  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated language subtag validation and formatting utility. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data theft, network activity, or system compromise. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is likely intended for code concealment or protection. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal, with a very low malware likelihood."
