  "conclusion": "The script is heavily obfuscated and syntactically invalid, but lacks evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and malformed parameters are suspicious but do not confirm malicious intent. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). It should be reviewed further for intent, especially if used in production, but based on current static analysis, it appears benign."
