  "purpose": "A setup script for a Python package, intended to configure package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description, imports setup functions, defines package info and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; no malicious data exfiltration or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reads README file, passes parameters to setup(), but includes invalid and obfuscated arguments that disrupt normal flow.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable names, invalid setup() parameters such as 'IDRzaYdsuPyoJXuHFzHbKHwKqvVxveEy=True' and 'NYYUNEkyftfXFWdhtatZnqQxqihCgcuN', syntax issues in classifiers list, inconsistent formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a malformed setup script with obfuscated variable names and invalid parameters that would cause runtime errors. No active malicious behavior such as network calls, data leaks, or code injection is evident. The obfuscation and syntax issues suggest either poor coding practices or an attempt to hide malicious intent, but static analysis shows no direct malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script is heavily obfuscated and syntactically invalid, but lacks evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation and malformed parameters are suspicious but do not confirm malicious intent. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high (~0.8), and the overall security risk is moderate (~0.3). It should be reviewed further for intent, especially if used in production, but based on current static analysis, it appears benign.",
