{
  "purpose": "The code implements an AWS CDK construct for deploying a Lambda function connected to an S3 bucket, supporting multiple languages and customizable parameters.",
  "sources": "Resource property definitions, including placeholder-like strings used as identifiers (e.g., 'ATqzNDFqhzxnVJwhCtpQiNfOUqlBMnWc') which are likely obfuscated variable names or auto-generated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "Configuration parameters setting up AWS resources; no data flow, network calls, or external data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Resource property assignments and construct initializations; no malicious data flow or external communication observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of placeholder or obfuscated strings as property names or identifiers, which are unusual but typical in generated or anonymized code; no malicious code or backdoors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are standard infrastructure as code for AWS resource deployment, with obfuscated variable names that hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely due to code generation or internal naming conventions. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the security risk is low. The high obfuscation score reflects the cryptic variable names, but this does not imply malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical AWS CDK resource configuration with obfuscated identifiers, which are likely placeholders or auto-generated names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are consistent with the code content. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured for infrastructure deployment.",
