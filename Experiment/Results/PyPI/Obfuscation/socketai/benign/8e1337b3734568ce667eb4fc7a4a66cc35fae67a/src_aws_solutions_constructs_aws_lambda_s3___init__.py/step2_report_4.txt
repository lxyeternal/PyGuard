  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard AWS construct for Lambda + S3, with code snippets in multiple languages. The code snippets contain obfuscated strings (e.g., 'ATqzNDFqhzxnVJwhCtpQiNfOUqlBMnWc'), but these are used as property names or identifiers, likely placeholders or auto-generated names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious data flow or external data leaks are evident. Configuration flows are standard.\n- **Anomalies:** Presence of placeholder-like strings is unusual but not malicious.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies that the code is a typical infrastructure pattern, with no malicious intent. The obfuscation is superficial and does not suggest malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.2 — seems reasonable given the obfuscation but no malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar to Report 1, with code snippets and configuration parameters, including obfuscated variable names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No suspicious data flows or operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The construct is standard, with obfuscation likely stylistic or auto-generated, not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.2 — consistent with the low suspicion level.\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Documentation snippets with obfuscated parameter names, no executable code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Configuration parameters, no data leaks or malicious operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated parameter names, but no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is purely documentation/configuration, with no malware.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.7 — the high obfuscation score seems appropriate, but malware score remains zero.\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar pattern, with configuration snippets and obfuscated parameter names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious operations.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscation, but no malicious intent.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a standard pattern, safe.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, which is reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Documentation snippets, with obfuscated variable names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No malicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscation, but no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is safe, primarily documentation/configuration.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, SecurityRisk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.8 — the high obfuscation score is justified; malware remains zero.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the absence of malicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** High (0.7-0.8) in most reports, justified by placeholder-like variable names and strings.\n- **Risk scores:** Very low (0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal security risk beyond typical configuration concerns.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 — the variable names and strings are obfuscated or placeholders, which could hinder readability but do not imply malicious intent.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — standard infrastructure code with minimal security risk.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a standard, well-structured AWS CDK construct for deploying Lambda + S3 resources, with obfuscation likely due to placeholder names or code generation, not malicious intent. No evidence suggests malware or significant security issues.\n\n**Recommendation:** The scores given are reasonable. No changes needed.",
