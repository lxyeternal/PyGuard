      "conclusion": "The code is an incomplete or placeholder setup script with a bug in json.loads(). There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or supply chain attack. The obfuscation score is moderate due to the variable name, but no malicious activity is detected. The security risk is very low, primarily due to the bug rather than malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code is a typical AWS CDK resource configuration with obfuscated identifiers, which are likely placeholders or auto-generated names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are consistent with the code content. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured for infrastructure deployment."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators, but lacks concrete malicious payloads. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and the overall security posture is moderate, warranting cautious review but not outright rejection."
