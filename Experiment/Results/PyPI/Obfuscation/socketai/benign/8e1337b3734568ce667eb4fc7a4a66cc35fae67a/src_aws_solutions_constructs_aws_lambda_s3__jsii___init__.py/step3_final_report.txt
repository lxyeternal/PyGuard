  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and suspicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, hardcoded strings, network connections, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), and file operations.",
  "sinks": "Network communication (data exfiltration), file writing, environment variable access, and dynamic code execution points that could lead to data leaks or system compromise.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or hardcoded strings flow into dynamic execution or network functions, potentially leading to data exfiltration or command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec, obfuscated code segments, hardcoded IPs/domains, suspicious string patterns, and inconsistent or unnecessary dynamic code constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation and dynamic execution, with some hardcoded network indicators. Suspicious patterns like eval/exec and obfuscated strings suggest potential malicious intent, though no definitive payloads are confirmed. Absence of code or benign patterns in some reports reduces concern. Scores assigned generally align with the observed patterns, with higher suspicion in reports indicating obfuscation and dynamic behavior. The overall assessment indicates moderate risk, with a malware score around 0.45, obfuscation around 0.45, and security risk around 0.35, reflecting the mixture of suspicious features and benign findings.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic execution indicators, but lacks concrete malicious payloads. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and the overall security posture is moderate, warranting cautious review but not outright rejection.",
