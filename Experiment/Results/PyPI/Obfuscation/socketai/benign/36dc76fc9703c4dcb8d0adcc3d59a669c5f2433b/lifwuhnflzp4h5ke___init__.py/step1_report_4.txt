  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform a specific task, but due to lack of context, it is not entirely clear. It could be a utility or a part of a larger application.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, possibly user input or configuration files. No other explicit data sources are identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or subprocess calls, but specifics are not provided in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through functions or modules that process or transmit it, potentially reaching network or system-level operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are present. The code appears straightforward, with no signs of hidden backdoors or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and lacks complexity. It reads from environment variables and possibly performs operations based on that data. There are no signs of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious network activity. The absence of obfuscation or suspicious patterns suggests benign intent. Without additional context or code, it is difficult to identify malicious behavior or supply chain attacks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. The code appears benign, with no hardcoded secrets or suspicious operations. However, the review is limited due to minimal code provided.",
