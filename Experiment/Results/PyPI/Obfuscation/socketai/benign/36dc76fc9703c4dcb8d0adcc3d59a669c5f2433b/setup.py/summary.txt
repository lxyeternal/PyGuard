  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation and a syntax issue. No active malicious behavior or security threat is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but not confirmed malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, but the malformed metadata warrants correction. Further review of the full package is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious payloads."
