  "purpose": "Define package setup configuration for a Python project, including dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "Static data within the script defining package metadata, dependencies, and package data.",
  "sinks": "None. No untrusted data input or output points are present.",
  "flows": "Not applicable. The script simply passes data to setup() with no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names (e.g., ZHcPUaLLwhAllSyttHCFQNTGEIqhJTxK), unusual long strings, and a missing value for 'long_description'. These could indicate obfuscation or tampering, or are simply poor coding style. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setuptools and calls setup() with a dictionary of package metadata. Variables are obfuscated but contain typical setup info such as package name, version, description, author info, and dependencies. The 'long_description' field appears incomplete, which could be a mistake or an attempt to hide content, but it does not indicate malicious intent. No dynamic code execution, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is present. The obfuscated variable names may suggest attempt at concealment but do not constitute malicious code. Overall, the code performs a standard setup routine with some irregular naming.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names and a possibly incomplete 'long_description'. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. Overall, the code appears benign.",
