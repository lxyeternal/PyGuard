{
  "purpose": "Define package metadata and configuration for Python package installation using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data for package metadata, dependencies, and package data; no external input sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted input; the code primarily sets static configuration.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration with no data flow from untrusted sources to critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, an incomplete 'long_description' field, and the presence of seemingly random string variables and data. No actual malicious code or behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools to configure package installation. Variables are assigned with obfuscated or random-looking names, but their content is static. The 'long_description' appears incomplete or intentionally obfuscated, but this does not impact execution. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or sensitive data handling is present. The code is consistent with a normal setup script, albeit with suspicious variable naming and incomplete metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a standard setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names and incomplete metadata. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly intended to evade simple code reviews, but no malicious activity is detected.",
