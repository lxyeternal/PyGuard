  "sources": "Static variables defining package info, dependencies, and data; no untrusted input.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows from untrusted sources or external inputs.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of package metadata; no dynamic or external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, malformed 'long_description' (missing value), incomplete metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with superficial obfuscation and a syntax error in 'long_description'. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation may be intended to evade simple review but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The malformed 'long_description' suggests a mistake or placeholder, not malicious sabotage. The static nature and dependencies indicate a typical package configuration. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation and a syntax issue. No active malicious behavior or security threat is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion but not confirmed malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, but the malformed metadata warrants correction. Further review of the full package is recommended to ensure no hidden malicious payloads.",
