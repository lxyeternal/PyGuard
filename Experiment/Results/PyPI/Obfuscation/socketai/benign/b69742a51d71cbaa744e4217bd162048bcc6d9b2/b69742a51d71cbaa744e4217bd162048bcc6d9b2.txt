      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for JSON data handling with obfuscated function names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious intent in a larger context, but based solely on this snippet, the security risk remains low."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation, with obfuscation being the primary concern. The low malware score aligns with the lack of evidence for malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe but should be reviewed in the context of the larger codebase and the contents of the imported modules."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated server extension handler with no confirmed malicious activity. The high obfuscation and placeholder methods raise suspicion, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. Further investigation into the imported modules and runtime behavior is recommended to rule out concealed malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation and network communication patterns that could facilitate malicious activities such as command-and-control or data exfiltration. While no explicit malicious payloads are visible, the structure and behavior warrant caution. Further dynamic analysis and inspection of external functions are recommended to confirm malicious intent."
