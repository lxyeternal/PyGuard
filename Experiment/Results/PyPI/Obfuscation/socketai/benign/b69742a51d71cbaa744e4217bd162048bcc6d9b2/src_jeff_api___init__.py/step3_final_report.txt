  "purpose": "To evaluate the security implications of import statements with obfuscated identifiers in a Python package, assessing potential malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "sources": "The import statements from local modules (.bridge, .extension, .message) importing obfuscated symbols.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present in this code snippet; the code does not process untrusted data or perform actions that could lead to data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only imports symbols without executing or passing data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or auto-generated symbol names in import statements, which could be used to conceal malicious intent but are not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static import statements importing obfuscated identifiers from local modules. No functions, data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscated names raise suspicion but do not demonstrate malicious behavior. The malware score is low (around 0.2), reflecting minimal suspicion, while obfuscation scores are high (around 0.75), consistent with the naming pattern. Security risk remains low (around 0.2), as no active threats are evident. The scores across multiple reports are consistent and appropriate, indicating cautious suspicion due to obfuscation but no active malicious activity. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation, with obfuscation being the primary concern. The low malware score aligns with the lack of evidence for malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe but should be reviewed in the context of the larger codebase and the contents of the imported modules.",
