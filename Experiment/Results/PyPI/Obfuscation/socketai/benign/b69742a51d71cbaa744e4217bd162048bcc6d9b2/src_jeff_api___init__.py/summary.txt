  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation, with obfuscation being the primary concern. The low malware score aligns with the lack of evidence for malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Overall, the code appears safe but should be reviewed in the context of the larger codebase and the contents of the imported modules."
