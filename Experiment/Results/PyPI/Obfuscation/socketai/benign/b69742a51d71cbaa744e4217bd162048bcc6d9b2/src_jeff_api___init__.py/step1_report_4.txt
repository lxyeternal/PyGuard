  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules within a package",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from .bridge, .extension, and .message modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling shown",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; purely import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking names for imported identifiers; no visible processing logic",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules with seemingly obfuscated attribute names. There are no data inputs, external network calls, or processing logic present. The naming suggests possible attempts at hiding the true purpose of the code, but based solely on these import statements, no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection is evident. Without additional context or implementation code, it's not possible to definitively identify malicious intent or obfuscation tactics beyond suspicion due to naming choices.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is limited to import statements with obfuscated attribute names, which alone do not indicate malicious activity. No malware or security risks are evident from these lines. Further code analysis is needed to determine intent.",
