  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules within a package",
  "sources": "Import statements importing obfuscated names from local modules",
  "sinks": "No direct sink for untrusted data or external effects identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; purely import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated names for imported objects, which could be a sign of hiding malicious intent or code obfuscation; no clear purpose of imported items",
  "analysis": "The code imports three entities from local modules with obfuscated identifiers, which may indicate an attempt to hide the functionality or reduce readability. No external data sources, network activity, or system modifications are present. The lack of code execution or data handling beyond imports reduces immediate risk, but the obfuscation raises suspicion of possible malicious intent or concealment.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a minimal import statement with highly obfuscated identifiers, which could be a tactic to hide malicious or malicious-looking code. However, without further context or code execution, it does not demonstrate active malicious behavior. The risk level is low but warrants cautious review of the full package.",
