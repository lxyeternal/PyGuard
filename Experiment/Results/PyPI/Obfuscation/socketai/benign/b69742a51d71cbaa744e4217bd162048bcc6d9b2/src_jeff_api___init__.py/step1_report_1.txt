  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules within the package",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .bridge, .extension, .message",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; imports do not execute untrusted code or handle data sources",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only static imports, no data flow from source to sink demonstrated",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear as obfuscated or auto-generated names, which can be suspicious but are not definitive malicious indicators",
  "analysis": "The code contains straightforward import statements from relative modules. The imported symbols are named with seemingly random strings, indicating possible obfuscation or auto-generation. No functions, data handling, or dynamic code execution are present that could lead to malicious behavior. The import statements themselves are standard Python syntax and do not inherently suggest malicious intent. Without additional context or code execution, these lines alone do not indicate malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple module imports with obfuscated symbol names, which could be an attempt at concealment but is not inherently malicious. Based solely on these lines, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
