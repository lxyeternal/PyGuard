  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules within a package",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .bridge, .extension, .message",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, no output or network communication shown",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible from the given code snippet as it only contains import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking names for imported symbols; no obvious malicious patterns, but naming obscurity could conceal malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports three symbols with seemingly random or obfuscated names from local modules within the same package. Without further context or implementation details, these imports themselves are benign. However, the use of obfuscated names could be a tactic to hide malicious code or backdoors, although this is not definitive. No suspicious behaviors, such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code execution, are evident solely from import statements. The code is minimal and appears to be a standard import pattern, albeit with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet only contains import statements with obfuscated symbol names. No malicious behavior is explicitly evident. However, the obfuscation warrants caution, as it could hide malicious code in the modules being imported or their subsequent usage. Overall, the code by itself appears benign but should be reviewed in the context of the larger project.",
