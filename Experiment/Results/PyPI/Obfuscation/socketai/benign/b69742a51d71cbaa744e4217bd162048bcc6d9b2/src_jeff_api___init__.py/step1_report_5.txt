{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules within a package",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .bridge, .extension, .message",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; the code only imports symbols",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; just static imports",
  "anomalies": "Unusually long, obfuscated-looking symbol names; no clear context for what they do",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three import statements importing specific symbols from relative modules within a package. The imported names are heavily obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to hide their purpose. There is no code execution, data handling, or network communication visible. Without additional context or the contents of the imported modules, it is impossible to determine malicious intent solely from import statements. No signs of hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious activity are apparent in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard import statements with obfuscated symbol names, likely part of a larger package. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this fragment.",
