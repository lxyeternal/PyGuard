  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated and intentionally nonsensical; no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single assignment of a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no inputs, outputs, or external calls. The variable name does not indicate any malicious intent or suspicious activity. No control flow or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version declaration with obfuscated variable naming, which is not inherently malicious. No signs of malware or security risks are present.",
