      "conclusion": "The code is a typical SMTP email sender with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks. Obfuscation is suspicious but not definitive. The code should be considered safe based on current analysis, though further review of dependencies and context is recommended."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of email and DNS utility functions with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0.1, and the overall security risk is low. The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming and code structure, but no active malicious behavior is detected."

      "obfuscated": 0.5,
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware but exhibits insecure practices through embedded, possibly sensitive, obfuscated strings. These could be placeholders or secrets, posing security risks if sensitive data is involved. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to poor secret management and obfuscation, but no malicious activity is confirmed."
