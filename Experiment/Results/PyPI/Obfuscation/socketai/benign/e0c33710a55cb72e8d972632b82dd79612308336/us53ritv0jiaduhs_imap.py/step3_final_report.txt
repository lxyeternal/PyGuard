  "purpose": "Collection of IMAP email utility functions including connection, message fetching, deletion, folder creation, and message moving.",
  "sources": "Function arguments such as host, username, password, folder_name, msg_uid, msg_uids, folder_path, and callback functions.",
  "sinks": "Server commands and connection parameters; no direct data leaks or untrusted data flows identified.",
  "flows": "Input arguments flow into server commands and connection setup; no suspicious source-to-sink paths detected.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated or placeholder strings like 'DbAGvcXQiEYlzqJWDRSNvNAYJaygwgPA' and 'kJWSZfNFPyACvBIjSKQRZnmYYFIcGRKK' embedded in connection parameters and comments; code appears fragmented and incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard IMAP operations with typical parameters. The suspicious strings are likely placeholders or obfuscation, not active malicious code. However, their presence in connection details and TLS options suggests potential hardcoded secrets or identifiers, which is insecure. No evidence of malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or backdoors is present. The code's structure and embedded strings raise concerns about secret handling and obfuscation practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware but exhibits insecure practices through embedded, possibly sensitive, obfuscated strings. These could be placeholders or secrets, posing security risks if sensitive data is involved. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to poor secret management and obfuscation, but no malicious activity is confirmed.",
