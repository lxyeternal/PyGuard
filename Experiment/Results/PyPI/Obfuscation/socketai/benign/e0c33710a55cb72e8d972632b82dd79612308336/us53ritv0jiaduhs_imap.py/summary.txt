  "conclusion": "The code does not contain active malware but exhibits insecure practices through embedded, possibly sensitive, obfuscated strings. These could be placeholders or secrets, posing security risks if sensitive data is involved. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to poor secret management and obfuscation, but no malicious activity is confirmed."
