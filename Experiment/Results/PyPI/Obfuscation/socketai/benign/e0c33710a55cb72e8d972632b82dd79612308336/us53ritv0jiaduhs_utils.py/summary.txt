  "conclusion": "The code is a set of email and DNS utility functions with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or payloads. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not constitute malicious intent. The malware score is set to 0.1, and the overall security risk is low. The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming and code structure, but no active malicious behavior is detected."
