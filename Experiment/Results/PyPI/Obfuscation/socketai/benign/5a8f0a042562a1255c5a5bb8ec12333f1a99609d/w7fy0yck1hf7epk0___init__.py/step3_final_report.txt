  "purpose": "Import a version identifier from a local module with an obfuscated name and define __all__ to expose __version__.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .version module, reading an obfuscated symbol; no other data sources.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated symbol -> alias assignment -> __all__ declaration referencing __version__.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import symbol name; __all__ includes '__version__' but __version__ is not defined or imported in this snippet; minimal code structure; no variable assignment for __version__.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated symbol from a local module, assigning it an alias. The __all__ list references '__version__', which is not defined within this snippet, suggesting incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code. No network activity, data handling, or malicious functions are present. The obfuscation appears to serve to conceal internal details or version info but does not indicate malicious intent. The minimal code structure and lack of side effects point to benign version management or internal module setup. The high obfuscation score reflects the obscured variable name, but the absence of malicious patterns or external interactions supports a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, obfuscated import statement likely used for version control or internal concealment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent, and the overall security risk is low.",
