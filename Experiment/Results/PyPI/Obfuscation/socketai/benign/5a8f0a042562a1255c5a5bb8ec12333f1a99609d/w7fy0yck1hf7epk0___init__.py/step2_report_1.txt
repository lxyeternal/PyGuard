  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .version import XjqMkLNzSwKFWTXnRxUmYhhNUraEWFHC as ysPengQsZEAJOXdkeHzFitLDqTgHNSss\n__all__ = (\"__version__\",)\n```\n\n---\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import version info, define `__all__`.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated import name, `__all__` includes `'__version__'` but no such variable is defined or imported.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation raises suspicion; no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies obfuscation but finds no evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score is appropriate. The security risk is minimal, given the lack of evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated symbol name, `__all__` includes `'__version__'` but the imported symbol is assigned to an alias that looks random. The `__version__` variable isn't defined in the snippet.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation and incomplete `__all__` suggest concealment, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** The high obfuscation score seems justified. No malware evidence; the risk score is low but acknowledges obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated import name, no malicious behavior, `__all__` includes `'__version__'` but not defined here.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to above; benign but obfuscated.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0, Obfuscated 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports; no malware, obfuscation noted.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated import name, no malicious behavior, `__all__` includes `'__version__'`.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation may be an attempt to hide behavior, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0.3, Obfuscated 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk score due to the potential for concealment, but no actual malicious activity observed.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Same.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated symbol name, no malicious behavior, possible auto-generation.\n- **Analysis:** Likely for internal version management; no malicious activity.\n- **Score:** Malware 0, Risk 0, Obfuscated 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** The high obfuscation score is justified; no malware risk.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Report Summary:\n- All reports correctly identify obfuscation, which is common in version or internal code.\n- None report actual malicious activity such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection.\n- The `__all__` variable includes `'__version__'`, but that variable isn't defined or imported in the snippets, which might be an oversight or part of a larger codebase.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 across all reports. No evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Ranges from 0.7 to 0.8, justified by the use of obfuscated variable names.\n- **Risk Score:** Very low overall (0.2-0.3), consistent with the absence of malicious activity but noting obfuscation as a potential concealment tactic.\n\n---\n\n### My Overall Assessment:\n- The code is minimal and primarily obfuscated, likely to hide the actual symbol name.\n- The obfuscation alone doesn't imply malicious intent, especially in version-related code.\n- The absence of any suspicious behaviors (network, file, or data handling) suggests the code is benign.\n\n### Recommended scores:\n- **Malware:** **0** (no evidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.75** (consistent with obfuscation but not malicious)\n- **Risk:** **0.2** (low, due to obfuscation, but no active threat)\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are consistent and cautious. The obfuscation warrants attention but does not currently indicate malicious activity. The scores should remain low for malware and risk, with a high obfuscation score justified by the naming patterns.",
