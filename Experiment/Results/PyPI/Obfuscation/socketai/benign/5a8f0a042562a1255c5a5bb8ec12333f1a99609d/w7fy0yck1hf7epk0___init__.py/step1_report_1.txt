  "purpose": "Import a version identifier from a local module and define __all__ for export.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a symbol from a relative module",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data leakage or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Import statement flows directly from local module to symbol alias",
  "anomalies": "Imported symbol name is an obfuscated-looking identifier, which may be a tactic to hide intent; no other anomalies present",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a seemingly obfuscated name from a local module 'version' and assigns it a new alias. The __all__ list only includes '__version__', which appears unrelated to the imported symbol. The obfuscated import name may be used to hide its purpose or for obfuscation. No other suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behaviors are evident. The code's purpose appears to be to expose version info via __all__, but the obfuscation raises suspicion about intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears intended to expose version information. The obfuscated import name might be an attempt to conceal details, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. Overall, the code seems benign but slightly suspicious due to obfuscation.",
