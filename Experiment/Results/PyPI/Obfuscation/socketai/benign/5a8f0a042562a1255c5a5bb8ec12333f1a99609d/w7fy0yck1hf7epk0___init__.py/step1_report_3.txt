  "purpose": "Import a version identifier from a local module and set __all__ to expose __version__",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a symbol from a local module",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or dangerous operations",
  "flows": "Import from .version -> __all__ assignment",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol has an obfuscated or non-descriptive name; the variable name appears intentionally obscured",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with an obfuscated name from a local module named 'version'. The imported name is a long, nonsensical string, likely obfuscated or auto-generated. The code then defines __all__ with '__version__', but does not assign or define __version__ in this snippet. The primary concern is the obfuscated import name, which may indicate an attempt to hide functionality. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data handling, or security risks. The import and __all__ assignment are standard practices, but the obscurity of the symbol suggests code hiding or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an obfuscated symbol name and a __all__ declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues; the obfuscation may be for code concealment or to hinder analysis. Overall, the code appears benign but intentionally obscure.",
