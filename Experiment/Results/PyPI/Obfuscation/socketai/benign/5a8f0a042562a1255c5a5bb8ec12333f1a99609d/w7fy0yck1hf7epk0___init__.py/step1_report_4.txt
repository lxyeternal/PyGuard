  "purpose": "Import a version identifier under a potentially obfuscated alias",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from .version module",
  "sinks": "None explicitly; no untrusted data handling or output",
  "flows": "Importing obfuscated name from module, exposing alias via __all__",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names and import alias, which may hide malicious intent or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code imports an attribute 'XjqMkLNzSwKFWTXnRxUmYhhNUraEWFHC' from the local version module and assigns it an alias. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious or unwanted behavior. The __all__ declaration restricts module exports to '__version__', but the obfuscation in import suggests possible obfuscation or concealment tactics. No other suspicious code, such as network calls, data handling, or malicious functions, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary concern is the use of obfuscated names for import, which could be an attempt to hide malicious or malicious-looking behavior. However, the snippet itself does not perform any malicious actions. The obfuscation warrants caution, but there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity in this fragment alone.",
