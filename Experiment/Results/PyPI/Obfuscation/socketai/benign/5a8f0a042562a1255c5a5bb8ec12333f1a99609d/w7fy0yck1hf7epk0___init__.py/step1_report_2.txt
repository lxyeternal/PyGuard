  "flows": "Imported version identifier (xsPengQsZEAJOXdkeHzFitLDqTgHNSss) assigned to alias ysPengQsZEAJOXdkeHzFitLDqTgHNSss, then __all__ is set",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical variable names; no obvious security issues but the naming may be suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a obfuscated name from a local module named .version. It assigns this symbol an alias that appears to be a random string. The __all__ variable is set to expose only __version__, but __version__ is not defined or imported in this snippet, which suggests incomplete or obfuscated code. No direct malicious behavior is evident, but the unusual naming and lack of clarity raise suspicion of obfuscation or concealment. The code itself does not perform any dangerous actions or data handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module import with obfuscated identifiers and incomplete __all__ definition. There are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks, but the obfuscated naming warrants caution as it might be part of a larger obfuscated or malicious package.",
