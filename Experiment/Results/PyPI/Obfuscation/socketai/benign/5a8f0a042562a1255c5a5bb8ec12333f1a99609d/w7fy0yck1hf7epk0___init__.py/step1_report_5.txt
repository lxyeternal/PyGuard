  "purpose": "Import a version identifier from a local module and set the public API with __all__",
  "sources": "Import statement from .version module",
  "sinks": "No sinks that lead to data leaks or external effects",
  "flows": "Import from .version -> setting __all__",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'XjqMkLNzSwKFWTXnRxUmYhhNUraEWFHC' which appears to be obfuscated or auto-generated",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a seemingly random, obfuscated name from a local module named 'version'. The symbol is aliased as 'ysPengQsZEAJOXdkeHzFitLDqTgHNSss'. The __all__ variable only includes '__version__', but there is no explicit assignment of __version__ in this snippet, which might be elsewhere or a potential oversight. The naming pattern suggests obfuscation, but no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or harmful actions is evident. The import could be for version control purposes, common in package setup. The obfuscated symbol name does not, by itself, indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement with an unusually obfuscated variable name, likely auto-generated or for internal version management. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
