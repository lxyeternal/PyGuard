It contains some obfuscation through variable naming and module import but lacks any evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage. The low malware likelihood, combined with moderate obfuscation and environment manipulation, suggests a low security threat but warrants ongoing monitoring and review of obfuscated parts."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits suspicious patterns—use of eval with environment variables, environment variable hijacking, obfuscation, and temporary file command execution—that are characteristic of potentially malicious or backdoored code. While no direct malicious payloads are evident, these patterns pose significant security risks, especially if environment variables are controlled by an attacker. Therefore, the code should be considered high risk with a malware likelihood score of approximately 0.75, obfuscation score around 0.8, and overall security risk near 0.75. Further dynamic analysis and environment control are recommended before deployment in security-sensitive contexts."
