  "purpose": "Import all symbols from tox._pytestplugin, likely for testing or plugin extension purposes.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no additional data sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows are present; the code does not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; the code is a single import statement with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' from an internal module; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a wildcard import from an internal module, which can obscure symbol origins and is generally discouraged. No malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity is evident. The import does not execute code beyond symbol inclusion, and no external data or network activity is involved. The risk stems from potential concealment of malicious symbols if the module is compromised, but there is no evidence of such here. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0, and security risk is low (~0.2) due to the import pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard but discouraged practice of wildcard importing from an internal module. No malicious activity or security threat is detected based solely on this snippet. The scores assigned are appropriate, with minimal risk primarily due to the import style.",
