  "purpose": "Assign version strings and tuples to variables, likely for version management or compatibility checks.",
  "sources": "Assignment statements for version-related variables.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment operations; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variables are assigned with seemingly random names, no clear purpose. No use of untrusted input, no obfuscated or dynamic code. The variable names appear nonsensical but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to one variable and a version tuple to another variable. Both assignments are straightforward and do not involve user input, environment variables, or external data sources. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The unusual variable names appear arbitrary but do not suggest malicious intent or obfuscation beyond naming conventions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing simple variable assignments related to versioning. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks detected.",
