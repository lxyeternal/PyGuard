{
  "purpose": "Store version information in variables for use elsewhere in the code",
  "sources": "Assignment statements initializing variables with version data",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; no external output or data handling observed",
  "flows": "No significant data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Variables assigned multiple times with different identifiers, potential obfuscation attempt; no meaningful malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code assigns version-related data to variables with obfuscated names and duplicates the same version info. No external input, no sensitive data handling, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The multiple variable assignments with similar values may indicate an attempt to hide intent, but this alone does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to merely store version information in variables with obfuscated names, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
