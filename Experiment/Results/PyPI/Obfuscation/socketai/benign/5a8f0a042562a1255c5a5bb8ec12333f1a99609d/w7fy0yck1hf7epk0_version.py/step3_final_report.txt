  "purpose": "Assign version info using variables, benign static assignment.",
  "sources": "Variables assigned static version strings and tuples; no external input or data flow.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or malicious effects.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names but no malicious code or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward assignment of version information to variables with obfuscated names. There is no external input, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely due to variable naming, but does not indicate malicious intent. The code's simplicity and static nature confirm the absence of security risks or malware. The assigned scores in the reports align with this assessment, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.2-0.4, and minimal security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, involving static version assignment with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security threats are present. The current scoring is appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
