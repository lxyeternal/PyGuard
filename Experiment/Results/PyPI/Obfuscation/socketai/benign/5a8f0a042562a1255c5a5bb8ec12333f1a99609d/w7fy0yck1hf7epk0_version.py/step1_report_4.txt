{
  "purpose": "Assigning version information to variables, likely for package versioning.",
  "sources": "Literal string '0.10.2' assigned directly to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input sources; no data flow to external systems or sensitive areas.",
  "flows": "None, as assignments are static and do not involve untrusted data or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Redundant variable assignments; no clear purpose for multiple assignments; no suspicious or obfuscated code present.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns the string '0.10.2' to two variables, then defines a tuple with version numbers. No external input or untrusted data is involved. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious code structures are evident. The code appears to simply manage version information with redundant assignments.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, handling version information in a straightforward manner without any malicious intent or security risks.",
