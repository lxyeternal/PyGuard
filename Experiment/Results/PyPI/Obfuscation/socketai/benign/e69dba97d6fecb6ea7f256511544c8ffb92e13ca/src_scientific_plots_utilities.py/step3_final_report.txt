{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for data processing, translation, plotting, and file management, primarily used for scientific or engineering data workflows.",
  "sources": "File I/O operations, external translation API, subprocess calls to gnuplot, environment variables, and input parameters.",
  "sinks": "External processes (gnuplot), file outputs, translation API responses, and potential data passed to subprocesses.",
  "flows": "Data read from files or input parameters flows through processing functions, possibly into external processes like gnuplot or translation services, then to outputs or files.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, complex wrappers, list modifications during iteration, regex-based string replacements, and dynamic translation logic. No hardcoded credentials or network exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions for data smoothing, statistical calculations, plotting via gnuplot, translation via external API, and file management. Obfuscation is present but appears to serve to conceal complexity rather than malicious intent. No evidence of malicious network activity, backdoors, or data theft. Use of subprocess and external API calls are standard but should be monitored in deployment. The code's structure and signals do not indicate sabotage or malware, but obfuscation warrants cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a collection of utility functions with obfuscation but no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware likelihood is effectively zero; obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is low. The scores are consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
