{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable name, likely serving as a version indicator or placeholder.",
  "sources": "The code reads a static string assigned to a variable; no external inputs or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code is a simple assignment with no data propagation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name, but no malicious or suspicious behavior; no external dependencies or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a shebang line and a single variable assignment with an obfuscated name to a version string. No inputs, outputs, network calls, or malicious activities are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. Scores of malware 0, obfuscation around 0.2, and security risk approximately 0.1 are appropriate given the minimal and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving likely as a version indicator. There is no malicious behavior, security risk, or malware activity. The obfuscation is superficial and does not suggest malicious intent. The current scores are consistent with the code's benign nature.",

  "obfuscated": 0.2,
