  "purpose": "Generate a random matrix and perform a mathematical operation on it.",
  "sources": "np.random.rand generates random data as input.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent to external systems or written to files; calculations are internal.",
  "flows": "Data flows from np.random.rand to subsequent arithmetic operations within the code.",
  "anomalies": "The import of a custom type 'IiRgwQRplpxuRWxLPlALrpVezmmVgqym' which is not used; no obvious malicious intent but unusual naming suggests obfuscation or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and a custom type, then creates a random matrix with dimensions 20x31. It then computes a quadratic expression on that matrix. The use of obscure variable and type names suggests possible obfuscation, but the logic is straightforward and limited to internal calculations. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or external network activity is present. The import of a custom type that isn't used could be suspicious, but it may be harmless or placeholder.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple internal computations with no malicious behavior or external data leaks detected. The unusual naming could indicate obfuscation but does not, in itself, imply malicious intent.",
