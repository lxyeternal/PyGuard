  "purpose": "Generate a random matrix and perform a mathematical operation on it.",
  "sources": "np.random.rand function generates the matrix data.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data usage present; no external data or output manipulation observed.",
  "flows": "Input source from np.random.rand flows into mathematical operation; no external data flows or outputs to untrusted destinations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a very long and obscure variable name; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy, defines a function that creates a random matrix with dimensions 20x31, performs a mathematical calculation involving squaring the matrix and multiplying it element-wise, then asserts the result is not None. All operations are standard numerical computations without any suspicious or malicious behavior. No input/output external to the process, no data exfiltration, and no malicious control flows.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward numerical computations with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a benign, standard data manipulation script.",
