  "purpose": "Generate a random matrix, perform a mathematical operation on it, and assert that the result is not None.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, input, or untrusted data (none detected); creation of random data via np.random.rand.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks that could lead to data leakage or execution of untrusted code; no external network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Generation of random matrix -> mathematical computation -> assertion check; no external data flow or influence.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a custom type 'IiRgwQRplpxuRWxLPlALrpVezmmVgqym' imported but not utilized; no clear purpose; variable naming obfuscated and non-descriptive; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and a seemingly obfuscated class. It creates a random matrix with fixed dimensions, performs a straightforward mathematical operation, and asserts the result is not None. No user input, no external communication, no dynamic code execution, or suspicious patterns. The purpose appears to be simple matrix computation with obfuscated variable names. No signs of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing basic numerical operations without malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious activity.",
