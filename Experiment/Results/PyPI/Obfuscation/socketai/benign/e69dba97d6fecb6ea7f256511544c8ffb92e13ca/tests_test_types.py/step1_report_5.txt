  "purpose": "Generate a random matrix, perform a mathematical operation on it, and assert the result is not None.",
  "sources": "np.random.rand generates a matrix of random values; the code reads no external input.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects; no output or external data interaction.",
  "flows": "Random data generation flows into mathematical operations, but no external data or untrusted sources are used.",
  "anomalies": "The use of a custom imported type from 'scientific_plots.types_' appears unused and irrelevant; the assertion is trivial.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy, defines a function that creates a 20x31 matrix of random floats, computes a mathematical expression on it, and asserts the result is not None. The custom import is unused, indicating potential unnecessary complexity or obfuscation. There are no inputs from untrusted sources, no data leaks, no external interactions, and no evident malicious intent. The mathematical operations are standard, and the assertion is trivial, serving no security purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs benign operations with no malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of an unused import may suggest unnecessary complexity but does not introduce security issues.",
