  "purpose": "Utility functions for styling, exporting, and plotting with matplotlib.",
  "sources": "Reads from CSV files, file paths, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Writes CSV data, saves plot images, and modifies global matplotlib settings.",
  "flows": "Data flows from CSV inputs into numpy arrays/dicts, then into plotting functions and file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names, dynamic overriding of plt.savefig, suspicious import statement for 'matplotlib' with a nonsensical module name, complex nested functions and environment manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code employs significant obfuscation primarily through variable and module name mangling, which appears cosmetic but could conceal malicious intent. It dynamically patches core functions like plt.savefig, which could be exploited to hide data exfiltration or tampering. No network activity, backdoors, or explicit malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation and dynamic behavior increase the risk profile, but no concrete malicious actions are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated plotting utility with heavy obfuscation and dynamic function patching. While no active malware or malicious behavior is evident, the obfuscation and manipulation techniques warrant caution. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to potential misuse of these techniques rather than active malicious payloads.",
