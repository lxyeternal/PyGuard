{
  "purpose": "The code contains functions that generate various plots using numpy data and save them as PDF files for testing or visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "Data is generated internally via numpy functions such as linspace, meshgrid, and mathematical operations; no external or untrusted input is read.",
  "sinks": "Generated plots are saved locally to specified file paths; no network transmission or data exfiltration occurs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy array creation and mathematical operations (sources) into plotting functions, which then save the figures to disk (sinks).",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, which is unusual but not indicative of malicious intent; no secrets, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple test functions that generate plots from numpy data, save them to disk, and verify their existence. No external data sources, network activity, or secrets are involved. The obfuscated naming is consistent across functions but does not imply malicious behavior. All functions perform benign plotting tasks, and no suspicious activity such as data exfiltration, network connections, or malicious code snippets are detected. The heavy obfuscation may hinder maintainability but does not elevate security risk. The malware score is therefore 0, as there is no evidence of malicious intent. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8) due to the heavily obfuscated names, which is justified. The overall security risk score remains low (~0.2), reflecting the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated testing functions for plotting, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation does not imply malicious intent but may impact maintainability. Overall, the security risk is low, and the code can be considered safe.",
