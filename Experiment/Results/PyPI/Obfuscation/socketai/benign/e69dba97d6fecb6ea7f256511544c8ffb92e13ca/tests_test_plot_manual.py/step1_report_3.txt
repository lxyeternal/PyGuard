{
  "purpose": "The code generates and saves various scientific plots using imported plotting functions and data generation routines, primarily for testing visualization capabilities.",
  "sources": "Data sources include linspace, meshgrid, and array calculations within each function; file paths for saving plots are specified explicitly.",
  "sinks": "File save operations for plots (e.g., plt.savefig), which could potentially be exploited if paths are manipulated; no network operations or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data is generated or imported from standard libraries, passed into plotting functions, and saved to specific file paths; no external data or untrusted input appears to influence critical operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; no obfuscated code, misleading variables, or unusual code constructs detected. The code structure appears typical for testing plotting functionalities.",
  "analysis": "The script imports several plotting libraries and defines multiple test functions that generate various plots and save them to disk. All paths are local and explicitly set. Data arrays are generated using linspace and mathematical operations. No network connections, data leaks, or malicious commands are present. The functions use test markers and decorators, consistent with testing practices. The plotting functions seem standard, with no suspicious modifications or hidden behaviors. The code appears clean, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard testing suite for plotting functions with no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It solely generates and saves plots based on predictable data. No malicious signals or malicious intent detected.",
