{
  "purpose": "The code appears to generate various plots and save them as PDF files for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Data sources include linspace and meshgrid functions generating numerical data, and paths where plot files are saved. No user input or untrusted external data sources are used.",
  "sinks": "The files are saved to specific paths; no data is sent over the network or external systems. Plot files are written locally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from data generation (linspace, meshgrid) through plotting functions, which then save files to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, and no suspicious variable names. No external network connections or data exfiltration present. Usage of third-party libraries is standard for plotting.",
  "analysis": "The script sets up several plotting functions decorated with testing style markers. It generates data arrays and plots them using matplotlib-based functions imported from 'scientific_plots'. Each function creates a directory if needed, generates plots, saves them as PDFs, and asserts the existence of output files. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, backdoors, or data theft. No suspicious or anomalous code is present; the code appears to be for testing or plotting purposes only.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign testing script for plotting functions with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It simply generates and saves plots locally, with no external communication or malicious behavior.",
