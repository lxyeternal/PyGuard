  "purpose": "Test functions generating synthetic data for plotting and verifying file outputs.",
  "sources": "Data generated via numpy linspace and array operations, file paths for plot outputs.",
  "sinks": "Temporary plot files (.pdf, .png) created and verified for existence; CSV files generated from data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from numpy array creation to plotting functions, then to file output and verification.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious line with 'np.pPzsotabGFzxDGcXgldZZVwoHFfachXv' which is undefined; obfuscated import names; placeholder or typo likely.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple test functions for plotting libraries, generating synthetic data, saving plots, and verifying files. The recurring suspicious line appears to be a typo or placeholder, not malicious code. Obfuscated import names and placeholder functions suggest code obfuscation or auto-generation but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system compromise is evident. The functions are typical for testing visualization routines, and the anomalies are minor and likely benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign testing routines with some obfuscation artifacts. No malicious activity is detected. The suspicious line should be reviewed and corrected, but overall, the code poses a low security risk.",
