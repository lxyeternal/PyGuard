  "purpose": "Setup of type annotations for numpy.ndarray objects with specific shapes, conditioned on TYPE_CHECKING, and a fixture class inheriting from pytest's FixtureRequest.",
  "sources": "Type annotations and variable assignments defining numpy.ndarray types; class inheriting from FixtureRequest with a param attribute.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external calls, or system interactions present; code is purely for static type hints.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flows; type annotations serve for static analysis only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, which may be superficial but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign setup for type annotations and test fixtures, with no data processing, external communication, or executable logic. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious activity. All signals point to a non-malicious, purely structural code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation is superficial; scores should reflect benign nature.",
