  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured visualization utility with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The primary risk is the potential misuse of file paths for writing output, which is a standard concern in such tools but not indicative of malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscated score is approximately 0.05 due to variable naming, and the security risk score is around 0.1, reflecting minimal concern."
