  "purpose": "Provides decorators related to Shibboleth authentication, specifically for logging attributes without enforcing login.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources present in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Logging of Shibboleth attributes; no other sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No clear data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code appears to be metadata or comments about decorators.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet contains only comments/descriptions; no executable code or suspicious constructs present.",
  "analysis": "The input is a comment describing decorators for Shibboleth integration, mentioning attribute retrieval and logging. No actual code, functions, or data handling is provided, making it impossible to evaluate for security issues or malicious behavior. The description suggests non-enforced attribute logging, which is typical for observability but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided snippet contains only descriptive comments about decorators and logging behavior related to Shibboleth. There is no executable code, data handling, or suspicious activity present. Therefore, it poses no security risk or malware concern.",
