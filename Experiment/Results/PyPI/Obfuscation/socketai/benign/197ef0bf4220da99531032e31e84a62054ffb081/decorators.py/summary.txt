  "conclusion": "The code snippets are mostly descriptive, with no active malicious behavior or complex obfuscation. The primary concern is the logging of a hard-coded, potentially sensitive string, which could lead to data leaks if logs are insecure. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with these findings. No changes are necessary; the overall security posture remains low risk but warrants cautious logging practices."
