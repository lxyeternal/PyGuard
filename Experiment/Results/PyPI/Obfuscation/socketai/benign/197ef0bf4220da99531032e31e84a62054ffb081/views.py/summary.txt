  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django view with obfuscation that might be intended to hide its purpose but does not exhibit malicious behavior in this fragment. Scores are consistent with a benign assessment: malware score of 0, low security risk (~0.2), and a high obfuscation score (~0.7). Further review of the complete codebase is recommended if obfuscation persists or additional logic is found."
