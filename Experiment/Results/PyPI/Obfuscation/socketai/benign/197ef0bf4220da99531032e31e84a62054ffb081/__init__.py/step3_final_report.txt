  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code or reports.",
  "sources": "Input data such as environment variables, user input, external files, network connections, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, file system, subprocess executions, environment variables, clipboard or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) to sinks (outputs or external communications), potentially through intermediate processing.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, unusual code constructs, backdoors, or malicious patterns. No anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators. Security risk scores are low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels are high (0.9) for reports with code, slightly lower (0.7) when details are limited, and zero when no code is provided. The assessments are internally consistent and justified based on the evidence. The only necessary correction is adjusting Report 5's confidence from 1 to 0 due to lack of code, which has been applied.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no malicious intent or obfuscation. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action or revisions are necessary.",
