  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scoring in all reports aligns with the evidence. Slightly lowering risk scores to 0.1 for minimal code could be considered, but current scores are appropriate. Overall, the supply chain security posture is very low risk."
