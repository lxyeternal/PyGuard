  "purpose": "Evaluate open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, input reading points, environment variable access, network connections, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network transmissions, environment variable usage, file modifications, system commands.",
  "flows": "Input sources (e.g., environment variables, user input) to sinks (e.g., network, file system, environment).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, placeholder code, minimal imports, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate minimal or no code present, with benign imports and no suspicious patterns. Malware scores are consistently zero, matching the lack of malicious activity. Risk scores are low (0.2 or 0), reflecting minimal threat. Confidence levels are high due to the straightforward nature of the code snippets. No anomalies or obfuscation are observed. The evaluations are consistent and justified given the limited code content.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The scoring in all reports aligns with the evidence. Slightly lowering risk scores to 0.1 for minimal code could be considered, but current scores are appropriate. Overall, the supply chain security posture is very low risk.",
