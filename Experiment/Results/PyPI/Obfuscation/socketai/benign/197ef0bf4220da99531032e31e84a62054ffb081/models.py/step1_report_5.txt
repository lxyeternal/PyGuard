  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing and possibly interacts with external systems, but without specific context, the primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly evident, but the code reads data from files, environment variables, or network requests if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or execution of dynamic code, but none are explicitly indicated.",
  "flows": "Data flow from input sources to processing functions and possibly output or external interactions, if any, are not clearly specified in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are visible. The code structure appears typical, with standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure and content do not reveal any suspicious or malicious behavior. It lacks indicators such as hardcoded credentials, network communication to suspicious domains, or code that executes system commands unsafely. No anomalies or obfuscation techniques are present. Without further context or external dependencies, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code seems to serve a legitimate purpose, with no signs of malware or supply chain sabotage.",
