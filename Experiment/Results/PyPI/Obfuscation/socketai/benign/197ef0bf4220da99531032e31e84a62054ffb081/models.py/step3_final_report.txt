  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets and reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, dynamic code execution, network/file sinks, data flows from sources to sinks.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, dynamic code evaluation results.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user inputs flow into dynamic code execution or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious network activity observed, dynamic features present but not confirmed malicious.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate low suspicion, with some noting dynamic code features that could be exploited but no definitive malicious activity. Scores are generally low, reflecting cautious assessment. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation detected. The confidence levels are appropriate, and the lack of code in some reports limits analysis but does not suggest issues. Overall, the code appears benign with minimal security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code and reports suggest no malicious intent or obfuscation. The low malware score (0) is justified, and the security risk score (0.2) appropriately reflects minimal concern due to dynamic features. No further escalation or modification of scores is necessary.",
