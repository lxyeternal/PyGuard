  "purpose": "Provides instructions and a URL for logging into a server using Shibboleth authentication.",
  "sources": "The URL 'https://school.edu/Shibboleth.sso/Login' which is the login endpoint.",
  "sinks": "The URL itself could be a sink if user input is inserted or manipulated, but no direct data flows are evident here.",
  "flows": "No explicit source-to-sink data flows are present; the code describes a static URL and an explanation.",
  "anomalies": "The string 'e.tauehhiaIfMRmdlfzgJJrLcpPEtOjaLE' appears to be a random or obfuscated token but is presented without context; it may suggest an obfuscated or malicious token if used improperly.",
  "analysis": "The code is a textual description with a URL and a suspicious token string. There are no executable commands or dynamic data handling. The token could be a secret or session identifier, but with no context or input handling, it appears static. The repeated instruction and description do not indicate malicious code or behavior. The presence of an obfuscated-looking token warrants attention, but without further code or data flow, it cannot be confirmed malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily provides static informational text about a login URL, with no active code or data flows. The token string is suspicious but not necessarily malicious on its own. No malicious behavior or supply chain risks are evident.",
