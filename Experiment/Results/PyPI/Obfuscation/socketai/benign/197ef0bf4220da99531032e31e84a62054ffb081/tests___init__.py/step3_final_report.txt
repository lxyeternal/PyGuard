  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code segments containing 'exec' with untrusted input, import statements, incomplete code, and minimal code snippets without executable logic.",
  "sinks": "Potential execution points such as 'exec', unverified input handling, and import statements that could lead to malicious activity or data leakage.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input read -> 'exec' execution or import -> potential malicious payload or obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'exec' with unverified input, minimal or incomplete code snippets, absence of context, and import statements without logic.",
  "analysis": "Report 1 identifies 'exec' with untrusted input as suspicious, assigning malware 0.4, obfuscated 0.4, risk 0.5. Given the dangerous nature of 'exec', a slight increase to malware 0.6 and risk 0.6 is justified. Reports 2-5 show benign or incomplete code with scores of 0 for malware and obfuscation, and low risk 0.2, which are appropriate. The overall assessment aligns with the evidence, with the primary concern in Report 1 due to 'exec' usage.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis confirms that Report 1 warrants a higher malware and risk score due to unsafe 'exec' usage, while other reports are benign. Adjustments to Report 1's scores improve accuracy, reflecting the potential threat.",
