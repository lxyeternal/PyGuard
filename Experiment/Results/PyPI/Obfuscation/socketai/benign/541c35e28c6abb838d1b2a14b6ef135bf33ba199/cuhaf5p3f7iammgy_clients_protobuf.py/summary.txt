  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a heavily obfuscated, possibly proprietary, HTTP client with retry and error handling. While obfuscation and unusual token handling are suspicious, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score and moderate risk warrant caution, but the low malware likelihood indicates no confirmed malicious activity based solely on this snippet."
