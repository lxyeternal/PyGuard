      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a device management script with significant obfuscation and credential exposure. It does not exhibit malicious behavior but has security-sensitive features that could be exploited. The low malware score is appropriate, while the obfuscation and hardcoded secrets warrant caution. Overall, it poses a moderate security risk due to potential misuse if secrets are exposed, but no active malware or sabotage is evident."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a device management script with security concerns due to hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, and extensive device control capabilities. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or malware. The malware score should be low (~0.1), reflecting the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), justified by the nonsensical variable names and code complexity. The security risk score is moderate (~0.6), mainly due to embedded secrets and broad device control, which could be exploited if misused. Overall, the code warrants cautious handling but does not appear malicious."

Obfuscation is notable but not necessarily malicious. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is primarily a device discovery module utilizing zeroconf/mDNS protocols. Despite heavy obfuscation, no active malicious behavior or sabotage is evident. The main concern is the obfuscation level, which could be used to hide malicious intent, but current evidence suggests benign functionality. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is minimal. Further static or dynamic analysis is recommended if deployed in security-critical contexts."

The current scores are appropriate, with low malware risk and high obfuscation suspicion. No active malicious behavior is demonstrated, but further analysis of the symbol's origin and content is advised."

While obfuscation and unusual token handling are suspicious, there is no definitive evidence of malicious behavior. The high obfuscation score and moderate risk warrant caution, but the low malware likelihood indicates no confirmed malicious activity based solely on this snippet."
