{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statement importing an obfuscated symbol from a local protobuf module, exporting 'Protobuf'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .protobuf module, specifically the symbol 'hiSTKMJlpoKgwzltYXxgDmdKfCsmlvVC'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data handling; import is local and no network or file operations are present.",
  "flows": "Import of the obfuscated symbol from the local module; no data flow beyond import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated symbol name 'hiSTKMJlpoKgwzltYXxgDmdKfCsmlvVC', which could indicate obfuscation or malicious concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing a single import of a symbol with an unusual, obfuscated name, and defining an export list. No malicious activity, network operations, or data leaks are evident. The suspicion arises solely from the obfuscated symbol name, which could be auto-generated or intentionally obscured. The scores assigned in the reports reflect high obfuscation suspicion but low malware likelihood, consistent with the code's benign appearance. Further investigation into the actual implementation of the imported symbol is recommended to determine if it contains malicious or obfuscated code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in structure but employs an obfuscated symbol name, which warrants cautious review. The current scores are appropriate, with low malware risk and high obfuscation suspicion. No active malicious behavior is demonstrated, but further analysis of the symbol's origin and content is advised.",
