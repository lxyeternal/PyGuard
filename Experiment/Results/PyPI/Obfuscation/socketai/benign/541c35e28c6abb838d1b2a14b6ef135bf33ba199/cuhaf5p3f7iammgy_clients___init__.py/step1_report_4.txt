{
  "purpose": "Defines a module exporting a class or object named 'Protobuf' and imports 'hiSTKMJlpoKgwzltYXxgDmdKfCsmlvVC' from a local 'protobuf' module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'protobuf' module.",
  "sinks": "None directly apparent; no untrusted data sources or output points are visible.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks identified; the code only performs a module import and export declaration.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol 'hiSTKMJlpoKgwzltYXxgDmdKfCsmlvVC' has a nonsensical, obfuscated-looking name which could be used to hide malicious intent. The code is minimal and does not reveal any obvious malicious activity, but the obfuscated symbol is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a cryptic, seemingly random name from a local module named 'protobuf'. It then defines an '__all__' list exposing 'Protobuf'. There are no visible data inputs, outputs, or complex logic. The unusual symbol name suggests possible obfuscation. Without further context, the code itself appears benign but warrants caution due to the suspicious symbol name.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and structurally simple, with no clear malicious behavior. However, the obfuscated import symbol raises suspicion of potential hiding of malicious intent. No direct evidence of malicious activity is present in this fragment, but the context or contents of 'hiSTKMJlpoKgwzltYXxgDmdKfCsmlvVC' could be malicious.",
