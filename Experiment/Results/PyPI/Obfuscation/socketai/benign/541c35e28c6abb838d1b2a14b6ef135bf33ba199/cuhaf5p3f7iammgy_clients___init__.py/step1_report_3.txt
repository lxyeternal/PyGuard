{
  "purpose": "The code imports a specific item from a local module 'protobuf' and defines an export list containing 'Protobuf'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .protobuf module",
  "sinks": "No sinks for untrusted data or external effects are present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow paths from untrusted sources to sinks; the import is static and does not process external input",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'hiSTKMJlpoKgwzltYXxgDmdKfCsmlvVC' appears as a seemingly random string, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent; however, it is merely an import name and does not perform any malicious activity in this context",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a relative import and an __all__ declaration. The import name appears obfuscated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no visible security risks, data leaks, or malicious actions. The code does not perform any operations beyond defining what is exported.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated import name could be intentional or suspicious, but in this isolated context, it does not pose a threat.",
