  "purpose": "Generate a Wi-Fi QR code image from provided device credentials.",
  "sources": "Attributes 'ssid', 'key', and 'wpa' from the device object 'wlzsZAcGxNTiSeEpaohVlhYdlBAKTzrc'.",
  "sinks": "The generated QR code bytes are returned; no external data flow or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input credentials from device object -> make_wifi generates QR code -> save to BytesIO -> return bytes.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code straightforwardly creates a Wi-Fi QR code from device credentials, writing it into a BytesIO buffer and returning the bytes. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. Obfuscation is superficial, related to variable naming, not malicious intent. The data flow is limited to local QR code generation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation) are consistent with this benign analysis. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident, and the obfuscation does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a utility purpose without malicious or suspicious behavior. The obfuscation is superficial and does not impact security. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0 and low security risk. No adjustments are necessary.",
