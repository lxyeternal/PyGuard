  "purpose": "Assigns version information to variables with obfuscated names.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments of version string and tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static assignments only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no malicious behavior or external data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments for version info, with obfuscated variable names. No external inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for stylistic or obscurity purposes, not malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports—malware score of 0, low security risk—are appropriate given the benign nature. The obfuscation level is moderate, which is consistent with the variable naming, but does not imply malicious activity. No vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident or implied. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in some reports can be justified as negligible, but overall, the code poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving solely as version labeling with obfuscated variable names. All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious activity, and the scoring is appropriate. No further action is necessary.",
