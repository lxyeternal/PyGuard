  "purpose": "Define version information using obfuscated variable names",
  "sources": "Variable assignments at the beginning of the code",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects other parts of the system or leaks occur",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples to variables",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated variable names; redundant assignment of 'version' to two different variables",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '0.0.1' to a variable with a obfuscated name and then assigns the same string to another variable. It also assigns a version tuple. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not perform any malicious actions. No external inputs, network operations, or sensitive data handling are present. The code is minimal and primarily for version labeling, with no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious data flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of obfuscated variable assignments for version info, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
