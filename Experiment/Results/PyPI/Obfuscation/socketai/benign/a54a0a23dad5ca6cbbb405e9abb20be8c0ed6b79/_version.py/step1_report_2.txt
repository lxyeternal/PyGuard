  "purpose": "Assign version information to variables, likely for package versioning.",

  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified.",
  "flows": "Assignment of hardcoded version strings to variables.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear obfuscated or generated, but no malicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a string '0.0.1' to a variable with an obfuscated name, then assigns a tuple (0, 0, 1) to another similarly obfuscated variable. The variable names seem intentionally obscure, possibly to hide intent, but there is no evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, code execution, or external communication. The code appears to be simply setting version information, typical in package setup scripts. No suspicious behaviors, inputs, or outputs are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code only sets version variables with obfuscated names; no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
