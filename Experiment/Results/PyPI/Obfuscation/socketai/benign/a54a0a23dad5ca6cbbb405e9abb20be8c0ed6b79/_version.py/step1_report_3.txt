  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package or module.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignments at the top level.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to external systems are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that appear obfuscated or randomly generated; no meaningful variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns string and tuple values to variables with nonsensical, obfuscated names. No external input handling, no dynamic execution, no network activity, and no sensitive data access. The variable names suggest obfuscation, but no malicious intent is evident. The code appears to simply store version info with unusual variable names, potentially for obscurity but not malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines version variables with obfuscated names, with no malicious behavior or security risks observed. The obfuscated variable names may indicate an attempt to hide intent, but there is no malicious activity detected.",
