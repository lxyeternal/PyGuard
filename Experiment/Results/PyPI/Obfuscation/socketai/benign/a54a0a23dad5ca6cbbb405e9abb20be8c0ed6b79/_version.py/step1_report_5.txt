  "purpose": "Assign version information to variables",
  "sources": "Assignment statements assigning string and tuple values to variables",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present",
  "flows": "Simple variable assignments with no data flow from external sources",
  "anomalies": "Redundant variable assignments; unusual variable names without clear purpose; no actual malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code assigns static version information to two variables, with one variable being assigned twice in a chained manner. The variable names appear obfuscated or nonsensical, but there are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or external communication. The code is straightforward and does not contain any control flow, input handling, or external dependencies that could be exploited.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, consisting solely of variable assignments with no malicious intent or security risks.",
