{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import version information and a widget component for a Python package, and defines the public API.",
  "sources": "The code reads from internal module files: ._version and ._widget.",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sinks are present; the code only assigns imported values to variables.",
  "flows": "Import statements (source) assign data to variables, but there are no flows to external systems or data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (GTimzsweYKdXrIxLBmatDgoACpXfbrmp, hrgMinZWmmUkwUYoHzLFZEmOsGxdsGdO) and dynamic import handling are unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a conditional import of version info, defaulting to 'unknown' if the import fails, which is standard practice. It then imports a widget component and exposes it via __all__. The obfuscated variable names seem to be intentionally obscure, possibly to hide implementation details, but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no external data sources, network connections, or sensitive operations. No suspicious behavior or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign part of a larger package, performing standard import operations with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
