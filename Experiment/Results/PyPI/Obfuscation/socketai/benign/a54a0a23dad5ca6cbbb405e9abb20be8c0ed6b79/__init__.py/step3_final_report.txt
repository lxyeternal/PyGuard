{
  "purpose": "Module initialization: attempts to import version info with fallback and imports a widget component, exposing it via __all__.",
  "sources": "Local module imports (_version and _widget), reading version info and widget definitions.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks or data flows to untrusted sources; code only performs local imports and variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Import source (_version or fallback) to variable; import widget to variable; expose widget via __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; fallback to 'unknown' for version import; no external data or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal, standard module setup with obfuscated variable names, likely for branding or minor concealment. No malicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, or network activity are present. The obfuscation is consistent across multiple reports but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk is low (~0.2), justified by the obfuscation but lacking evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing typical module initialization with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity is detected, and the current scoring accurately reflects its benign nature. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent in this context.",
