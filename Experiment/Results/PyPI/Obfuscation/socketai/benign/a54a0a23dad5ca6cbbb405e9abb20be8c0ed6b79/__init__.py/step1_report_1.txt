{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a version string and a widget component, setting a default version if import fails, likely for version management and exposing a widget component.",
  "sources": "Reading the module's own '_version' and '_widget' submodules.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Imports from local modules → assigns to variables → exports a widget.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated variable names; import fallback with a generic string 'unknown' — this pattern is unusual but not inherently malicious. No code execution, data exfiltration, or hidden behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports version information and a widget component from local modules, with a fallback for the version. The variable names are obfuscated, which is unusual but not malicious. The '__all__' declaration exposes only a specific widget class. No suspicious behavior, external network activity, or data manipulation present. The pattern appears consistent with standard version management and modular design.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module initialization snippet, with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
