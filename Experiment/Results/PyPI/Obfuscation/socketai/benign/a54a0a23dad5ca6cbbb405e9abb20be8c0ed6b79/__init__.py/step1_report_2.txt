  "purpose": "Attempt to import version information and a widget component, likely for package versioning and UI purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (_version and _widget).",
  "sinks": "No external or untrusted data sources or sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; only static imports and assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names (GTimzsweYKdXrIxLBmatDgoACpXfbrmp, hrgMinZWmmUkwUYoHzLFZEmOsGxdsGdO) suggests an attempt to hide intent. The version import is wrapped in try-except to handle import errors gracefully, which is common but not suspicious in itself.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version string from a local module, with an unusual variable name, and assigns a default 'unknown' if the import fails. It also imports a widget component with an obfuscated variable name. The __all__ list exposes only 'ValidateLabelsWidget'. No external data or network activity is present. Obfuscated variable names could be a sign of code hiding or malicious intent, but in open-source contexts, they may also be a means to obscure implementation details.\n\nNo malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident. The code is minimal and primarily for version and widget inclusion. The obfuscation alone does not confirm malicious intent, especially in open-source packages that might use such techniques for branding or to deter casual inspection.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard version and widget imports with obfuscated variable names, possibly for code hiding. No malicious or security-risk activities are detected.",
