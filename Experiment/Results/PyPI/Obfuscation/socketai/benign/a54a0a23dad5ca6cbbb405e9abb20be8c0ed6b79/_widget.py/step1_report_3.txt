{
  "purpose": "This code provides a GUI tool integrated with napari for labeling and reviewing image regions, saving label states to YAML files, and visualizing labeled data.",
  "sources": "Reads YAML files for label lists and label data; reads image and label layers from napari viewer; reads user input via GUI widgets and keyboard events.",
  "sinks": "Writes updated label dictionary to a new YAML file; modifies napari viewer layers and visualizations; updates text overlay in viewer.",
  "flows": "User opens YAML, which is loaded into label list and label dict. Labels are processed with regionprops to determine bounding boxes, which are used for visualization. User interacts via GUI and keys to update label states, which are saved back to YAML and influence viewer layers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code loading via yaml.full_load; no obvious hardcoded credentials or backdoors; GUI widget creation and key bindings are standard; no suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification observed.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a GUI with file input, label display, slider, and buttons. It loads label data and YAML files, processes image regions, and visualizes them in a separate napari viewer. User interactions update label states and save to files, with keybindings for labeling actions. The code structure appears typical for a GUI-based annotation tool. No obfuscated code, malicious payloads, or suspicious data flows detected. The code does not perform any network communication, system modifications, or hidden activities. All operations are consistent with an image annotation application.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions as an image annotation tool, enabling label review and visualization within napari. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a legitimate, standard application for image labeling, with no signs of sabotage, malware, or malicious data handling.",
