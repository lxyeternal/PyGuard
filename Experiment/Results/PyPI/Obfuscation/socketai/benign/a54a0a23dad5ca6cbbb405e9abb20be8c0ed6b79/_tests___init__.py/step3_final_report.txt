  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, system commands, network calls, file operations",
  "sinks": "Network connections, system commands, file writes, environment variables",
  "flows": "Sources (inputs) potentially leading to sinks (outputs) via code execution paths",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no obfuscation, no suspicious imports or patterns, no malicious network activity",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate no code or benign code snippets, with scores of malware=0 and obfuscated=0 justified. The risk scores are uniformly at 0.2, reflecting cautious default given incomplete context, but could be slightly lowered to 0.1 or 0.0 as no suspicious activity is observed. The reasoning across reports is consistent and appropriate, with no evidence of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated code detected. The current scores are justified, though the risk score could be conservatively reduced. Overall, the dependency is considered safe based on available information.",
