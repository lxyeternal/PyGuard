  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a standard Python script possibly intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, possibly user input via function parameters or external files if present.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are network connections (e.g., requests or socket usage), file writes, or system commands if invoked.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (environment variables, input) through processing functions to sinks (network, file, system calls).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious API keys; no obfuscated code or unusual language features. However, if external network calls or system commands are present without clear purpose, they could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard import statements and function definitions, with no obvious malicious imports or obfuscation. There are no hardcoded secrets or unusual code constructs. The flow from input to output is typical unless network or system calls are used in an unexpected manner. Without specific code snippets, the review is based on typical patterns. If external network calls are made to suspicious domains or unencrypted data transmission occurs, these could be malicious. The overall structure suggests benign behavior, but absence of explicit code limits certainty.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no evident signs of malicious behavior or malware. The code appears standard and does not contain suspicious patterns. However, without detailed code content, this assessment cannot be definitive.",
