{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be test functions for a napari plugin or widget, designed to add images and interact with layers, and then capture and assert output messages.",
  "sources": "np.random.random() calls generating random data, and method calls on widget objects",
  "sinks": "None of the code shows untrusted data being processed or outputted to external systems; the only output is to capsys, a testing utility capturing standard output",
  "flows": "Random data generated flows into image addition, widget method calls, and output capture, but there are no untrusted sources flowing into security-critical sinks",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution detected. The code structure is typical for test functions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and specific widget classes, then defines two test functions that create a viewer, add an image, interact with widgets, and verify output messages. The data sources are the random numpy arrays, which are benign. The output assertions check for expected informational messages. No external input handling, network communication, or security-sensitive operations are present. The code appears to be straightforward testing code with no malicious intent or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard testing code for a napari plugin/widget, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It simply adds images, interacts with widgets, and verifies output messages, all within a controlled test environment.",
