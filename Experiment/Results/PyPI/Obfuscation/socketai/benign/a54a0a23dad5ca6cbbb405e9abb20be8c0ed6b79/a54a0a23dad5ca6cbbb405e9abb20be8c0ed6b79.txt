      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, image annotation tool with no signs of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent but reduces code readability. The supply chain security risk is negligible, with malware score 0, obfuscation around 0.6, and low security risk (~0.2)."
