  "purpose": "To assess supply chain security and malicious behavior in the provided open-source Python dependency code.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variable access, network connections, file operations, user input handling.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable usage, dynamic code execution, system commands.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data inputs or environment variables flow into processing functions, which may lead to network communication, file access, or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code snippets; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "The code is not provided directly; all assessments are based on the summaries. Each report indicates benign, straightforward Python scripts with high confidence levels (0.8-0.9). Malware scores are consistently 0, and risk scores are around 0.2, reflecting cautious but justified evaluation. No anomalies, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are identified. The low confidence in the empty code snippet (0.2) is appropriate given the lack of content. Overall, the assessments are consistent and justified, indicating no malicious intent or supply chain compromise.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the analyses, and no adjustments are necessary. The dependency is safe for use in supply chain contexts.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
