  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code segments, if present.",
  "analysis": "The review process involved examining all code sections, including the beginning, middle, and end. No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior was observed. Usage of third-party libraries was standard, and no unusual data flows or obfuscation were detected. The code structure appears typical of a Python project, with no signs of malicious intent or supply chain tampering.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or significant security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign Python script. Confidence in this conclusion is high, with a score of 0.9. No obfuscation or malware indicators were found, resulting in malware score 0.0 and security risk score 0.2.",
