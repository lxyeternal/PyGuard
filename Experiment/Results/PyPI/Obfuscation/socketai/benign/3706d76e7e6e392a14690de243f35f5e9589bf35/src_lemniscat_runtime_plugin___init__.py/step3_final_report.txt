  "purpose": "Assess supply chain security of the open source dependency based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "No code snippets provided; analysis based on report descriptions of data sources such as user input, environment variables, files, network sources.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, system commands, file writes, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like user input or environment variables to sinks such as network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code detected; reports explicitly state absence of malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of code or malicious indicators. Scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0.2) are consistent with descriptions. High confidence levels (0.8-0.9) are justified given the conservative assessments. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or significant security risks is present. The lack of code limits analysis, but the reports' conclusions are appropriate and conservative.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency is benign with no detected malicious activity or obfuscation. The low security risk score (0.2) reflects minimal potential concerns. All reports' evaluations are justified and consistent; no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
