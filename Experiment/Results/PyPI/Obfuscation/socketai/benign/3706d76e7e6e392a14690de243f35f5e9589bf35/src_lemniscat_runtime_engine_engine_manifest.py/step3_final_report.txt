  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, user input, external files, network requests, dynamic code execution points such as eval()/exec().",
  "sinks": "System commands, network communications, data writes/exfiltration, dynamic code execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources like environment variables or user input flow into code execution or network transmission points, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URLs/credentials, use of eval()/exec(), dynamic code execution, obfuscated variable names, suspicious network activity, potential data exfiltration indicators.",
  "analysis": "Most reports correctly identify benign code with no suspicious patterns, assigning low malware and obfuscation scores. Report 5 notably describes multiple malicious indicators such as hardcoded secrets, eval()/exec() usage, and network exfiltration, justifying higher scores. The scoring aligns with the described behaviors, with malware scores around 0.6 for Report 5 and near zero for others. Confidence levels reflect the evidence provided. No false positives or inconsistencies are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment and scores are consistent with the code descriptions. Report 5 warrants a high malware and risk score due to explicit malicious patterns, while other reports are benign. No further adjustments are necessary.",
