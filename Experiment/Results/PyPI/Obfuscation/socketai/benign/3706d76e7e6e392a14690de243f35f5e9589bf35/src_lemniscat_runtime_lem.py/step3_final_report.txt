  "purpose": "CLI setup for Lemniscat task orchestrator, handling environment variables and command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LEM_DEBUG', user input via argparse arguments.",
  "sinks": "No external data leaks or network activity; only internal configuration and environment checks.",
  "flows": "Environment variable influences debug print; user arguments configure manifest, verbosity, config files, output context.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward CLI initialization script: imports modules, checks environment variable for debug mode, defines static description functions, and sets up argument parsing with default values. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data leaks are present. External modules are imported but not suspicious. The logic is standard and secure, with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign CLI setup for a task orchestrator with no security risks or malicious behavior. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and clarity.",
