  "purpose": "This code snippet is a comment indicating that a plugin package is used to load all available plugins.",
  "sources": "No data sources; only a comment or descriptive string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted input handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only a descriptive comment without executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, only a comment; no anomalies or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is purely a comment describing plugin loading functionality. No actual code, data flows, or suspicious behaviors are present. Given the lack of executable logic, there are no security concerns, malware indicators, or obfuscation. The comment does not contain secrets or malicious intent. The risk associated with this snippet is minimal, primarily dependent on the trustworthiness of the plugin sources, which is not specified. The malware score is therefore 0, obfuscation score 0, and security risk score very low (~0.1), reflecting the minimal threat level. Confidence in this assessment is high due to the simplicity and lack of code.",
  "conclusion": "The provided snippet is a benign comment with no executable code or security issues. The scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating no malware, no obfuscation, and negligible security risk. Further analysis would require actual implementation code to identify potential vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.",
