  "conclusion": "The code is predominantly benign with no confirmed malicious activity. Suspicious patterns like eval()/exec() and obfuscation are present in some cases but do not definitively indicate malware. The current scores are appropriate; a slight increase in malware suspicion for Report 3 could be considered if further evidence suggests malicious intent."
