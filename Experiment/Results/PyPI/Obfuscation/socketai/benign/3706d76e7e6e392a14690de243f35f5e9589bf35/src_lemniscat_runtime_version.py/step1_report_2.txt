{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a basic implementation of data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, the specific intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external libraries, such as reading user input or fetching environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing to console, writing to files, or network communication functions if present, especially if any untrusted data is sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables to sinks like print statements, file writes, or network calls, if such are present in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious obfuscation, or unusual code patterns are detected. The code structure is straightforward without signs of obfuscation or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. It reads input or environment data, processes it with standard Python functions, and may output or store results. No dangerous patterns such as command injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are observed. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical, and no signs of malicious intent are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is standard and does not contain any suspicious or malicious logic. Confidence in this assessment is high.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
