  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is to perform some data processing or utility function, but without seeing the actual code, the specific intent cannot be precisely determined.",
  "sources": "Potential sources include user input functions, environment variable reads, file reads, or network requests, but no specific source is identifiable without the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network transmission functions, file write operations, or system command executions; specific sinks are not identified due to lack of code.",
  "flows": "Data flow from sources to sinks cannot be mapped without the code, but any untrusted input passing through transformations into sinks could be a concern.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without examining the code. The code snippet is absent, so unusual behaviors like hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or dynamic execution cannot be assessed.",
  "analysis": "No code provided for analysis. Cannot identify sources, sinks, or flows without actual code. Cannot assess anomalies or malicious patterns without code content.",
  "conclusion": "Insufficient information to determine the purpose, potential malicious behavior, or security risks of the code. Please provide the code snippet for a detailed review.",
