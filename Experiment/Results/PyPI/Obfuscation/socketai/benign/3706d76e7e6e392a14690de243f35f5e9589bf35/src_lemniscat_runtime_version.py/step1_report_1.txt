{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be related to data processing or utility functions, but the exact intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and potentially from files or network sources if present elsewhere in the code.",
  "sinks": "Data may be output via print statements, file writes, or network calls, though specific sinks are not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through processing functions, potentially ending up in output or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code constructs are present. There are no signs of obfuscation, suspicious network connections, or cryptic dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using standard Python features and libraries. No malicious patterns like code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity are evident. Usage of environment variables and file operations appears typical for utility scripts. The lack of sensitive hardcoded secrets or obscure code patterns further reduces concern. Without additional context or external inputs, no malicious intent is detectable.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malware or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a benign utility or processing script with no immediate security threats identified.",
