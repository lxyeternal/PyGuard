  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Module imports, environment variables, network operations, dynamic code execution, data handling, hardcoded strings.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file handling, dynamic execution points, data output, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or data inputs flow into processing functions, network modules, or dynamic execution points, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic code execution, minimal comments, hardcoded strings, potential network communication without clear purpose, missing code snippets making analysis incomplete.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are largely missing or minimal, making definitive analysis challenging. Reports 1 and 4 correctly identify absence of code, assigning low risk and malware scores. Reports 2 and 3 describe features such as network modules and dynamic execution, which could be misused but lack concrete malicious payloads, justifying moderate risk scores. No obfuscation is detected across reports. The scores are consistent with the evidence, with malware scores at 0 and obfuscation at 0. due to lack of evidence. Risk scores are slightly conservative, reflecting potential misuse features but no confirmed malicious activity. Confidence levels vary but are generally moderate, given the incomplete code context.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are reasonable given the available information. No confirmed malicious activity or obfuscation is detected. The risk scores appropriately reflect potential concerns without overestimating threats. The overall assessment indicates low to moderate security risk with no active malware present.",
