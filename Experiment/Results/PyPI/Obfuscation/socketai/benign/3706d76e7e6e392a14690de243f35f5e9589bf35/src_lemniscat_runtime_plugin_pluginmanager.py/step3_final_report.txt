{
  "purpose": "The code provides high-level comments and function signatures outlining plugin discovery, instantiation, and command handling, serving as documentation or interface placeholders.",
  "sources": "Comments and function signatures within the code, no actual data input or external data reads present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external interactions; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows involving untrusted sources to sinks, as the code contains only definitions and comments without implementation.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable logic, implementation, or data handling; only documentation and signatures are present. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely descriptive, consisting of comments and function signatures without any operational logic. No data flows, external interactions, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The lack of executable code indicates no malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The minor security risk score of 0.1 in one report is slightly conservative; given the absence of actual code, a score of 0 would be more consistent. Confidence levels are high due to the clarity and benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign documentation or interface outlines with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly identify the non-executable nature of the code and assign appropriate scores. The overall security posture is safe, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and risk scores at 0, reflecting the absence of operational logic or external interactions.",
