  "sinks": "No sinks such as network transmissions, file writes, or system modifications are present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no evident data flows involving untrusted input; the code focuses on class discovery and instantiation from modules.",
  "anomalies": "The snippet contains only comments and function signatures without implementation details. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are visible.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment consists of descriptive comments and function signatures related to plugin management, including discovering plugin classes, returning plugin instances by name, and creating plugins from modules. There is no evidence of code execution, data handling, or external communication. Since the snippet lacks implementation details, it does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security issues. The comments suggest standard plugin management practices without any suspicious or malicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears to be a typical plugin management outline without any malicious or suspicious components.",
