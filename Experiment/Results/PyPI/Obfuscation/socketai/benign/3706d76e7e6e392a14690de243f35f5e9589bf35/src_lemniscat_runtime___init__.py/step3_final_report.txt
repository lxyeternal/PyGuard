  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of import statements from the 'lemniscat' package in Python code.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'lemniscat.runtime.lem' and 'lemniscat.runtime.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "None; only import statements with no further code execution.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected in the code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from the 'lemniscat' package. There is no executable code, data handling, or network activity. The package name is uncommon but does not imply malicious intent. Scores for malware and obfuscation are correctly set to 0, and security risk scores are minimal (around 0.1), reflecting the benign nature of the snippet. The high confidence score (around 0.9) aligns with the straightforward analysis. Without further context or internal module inspection, no malicious activity or vulnerabilities can be inferred from these import statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code snippet is benign, consisting solely of import statements with no evidence of malicious activity or security issues. The scores and assessments across the reports are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
