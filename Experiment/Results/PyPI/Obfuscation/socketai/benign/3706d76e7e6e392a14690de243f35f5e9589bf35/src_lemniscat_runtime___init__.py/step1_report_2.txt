{
  "purpose": "Import modules from the lemniscat package, likely for runtime operations or version handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from lemniscat.runtime.lem and lemniscat.runtime.version modules.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external communication are evident.",
  "flows": "Import statements do not involve data flows or untrusted input processing.",
  "anomalies": "Only import statements with no further code; no anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of two import statements from a third-party package 'lemniscat'. These imports suggest usage of internal modules related to runtime behavior and versioning. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code obfuscation. The package 'lemniscat' itself is not inherently malicious, and the code is straightforward. Without additional context or code, no malicious intent or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code only imports modules from the lemniscat package, with no suspicious or malicious elements detected. It appears to be standard setup code with no security concerns.",
