  "purpose": "Import modules from the 'lemniscat' package, likely to utilize its functions or classes in the larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'lemniscat.runtime.lem' and 'lemniscat.runtime.version'. These are static import statements, not reading external input or data at runtime.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations within these lines.",
  "flows": "No data flows are apparent in these import statements, as they merely load modules.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns are visible in these import statements. The modules' contents are not shown, so cannot assess internal code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, which are common in Python modules to include external dependencies or internal packages. Without additional context or code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. Import statements by themselves are benign and do not pose security risks unless the imported modules are malicious. As only import statements are provided, no further analysis of code behavior or potential threats can be conducted.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there are no indications of malicious intent or security issues. The code appears to be standard module imports. However, full assessment of risk depends on the contents of the imported modules, which are not provided.",
