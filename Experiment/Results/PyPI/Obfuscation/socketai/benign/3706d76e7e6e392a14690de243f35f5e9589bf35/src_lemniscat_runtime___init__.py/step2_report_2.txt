  "review": "Let's analyze these reports carefully:\n\n1. **Code Content & Behavior**  \nAll snippets are limited to simple import statements from the 'lemniscat' package modules ('lemniscat.runtime.lem' and 'lemniscat.runtime.version'). There is no code execution, data handling, or suspicious activity shown.\n\n2. **Presence of Malicious Behavior**  \nBased solely on the import statements, there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Import statements are standard in Python and benign unless the imported modules perform malicious actions internally, which cannot be determined here.\n\n3. **Assessment of Risks & Scores**  \n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis that there's no evidence of malicious code. This seems appropriate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation in the code snippet.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly low (0.1 to 0.2), reflecting minimal concern based on the provided code. This seems reasonable given the limited context.\n\n4. **Validity of Reasoning & Logic Flaws**  \nThe reports correctly identify that import statements alone are benign. They also note the lack of suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Some mention the 'lemniscat' package is not widely known, which is a cautious note, but it doesn't imply maliciousness.\n\n5. **Potential Over- or Under-Scoring**  \n- The scores are consistent with the evidence.  \n- No report assigns a high malware or security risk score, which is appropriate.\n\n6. **Additional Considerations**  \n- Without knowledge of what the imported modules do internally, we cannot fully rule out malicious behavior. However, based on the import statements alone, there's no reason to suspect malicious activity.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**  \n- The scores assigned are reasonable and justified given the evidence.  \n- The confidence levels are high (0.7 to 0.9), which is appropriate for such limited snippets.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**  \n- The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments.  \n- The lack of further code or context prevents any suspicion beyond cautious note about the package name.\n\n**My own estimates:**  \n- **Malware:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal risk, standard import statements)\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe provided code snippets are benign import statements with no signs of malicious activity or security issues. The scores and reasoning across the reports are appropriate and aligned with the evidence.",
