  "purpose": "Import modules from the lemniscat library, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'lemniscat.runtime.lem' and 'lemniscat.runtime.version'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident from the import statements alone.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of import statements; no anomalies or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports two modules from a package named 'lemniscat', which appears to be a third-party library. No code execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior is present. As such, this is a standard import pattern with no immediate security concerns. Without further context or usage, it is not possible to assess malicious intent beyond the imports.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is limited to importing modules and does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. There is no evidence of malware or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
