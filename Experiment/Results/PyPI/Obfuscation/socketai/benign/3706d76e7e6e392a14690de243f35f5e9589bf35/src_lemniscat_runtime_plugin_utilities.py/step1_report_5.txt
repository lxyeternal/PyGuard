  "purpose": "The code is intended to handle configuration and filtering of directories related to a plugin package and module.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'plugins_package', 'package_name', and 'module_name', which are likely provided by the user or calling code.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output a list of directories or module names, potentially used for dynamic imports or further processing.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are processed through filtering functions, resulting in outputs such as directory lists or module names.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL connections, or unusual code patterns are evident. The code appears to be standard configuration handling.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists of descriptive comments and parameter definitions, outlining functions for directory filtering and module handling. There are no signs of data leaks, malicious code, or obfuscated logic. The purpose seems to be to manage plugin configurations safely. Without actual implementation code, there are no active code flows, injections, or security risks detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided comments and parameter descriptions, the code appears to be straightforward configuration handling with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. The absence of implementation details limits confidence, but there are no indicators of malicious intent.",
