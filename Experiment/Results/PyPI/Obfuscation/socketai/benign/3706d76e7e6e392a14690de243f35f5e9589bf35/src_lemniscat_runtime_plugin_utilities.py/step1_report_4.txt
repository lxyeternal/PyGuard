  "purpose": "Provides functions to filter directories and handle package configuration for plugins.",
  "sources": "No specific input or data reading points are visible in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are identifiable, as there is no code that processes untrusted data or performs sensitive actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks can be established given the absence of executable code or logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears as a fragment of comments or docstrings with no executable statements, which is unusual and suggests incomplete code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet only contains descriptive comments about functions and parameters, with no actual code or logic implemented. There are no apparent data inputs, outputs, or processing. As a result, there are no security risks, malicious behaviors, or obfuscation present. The lack of code prevents any detailed source-sink analysis or flow tracking.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is purely documentation or placeholder comments with no executable content. It does not contain malicious behavior, security issues, or obfuscation. Based on available information, the code appears safe.",
