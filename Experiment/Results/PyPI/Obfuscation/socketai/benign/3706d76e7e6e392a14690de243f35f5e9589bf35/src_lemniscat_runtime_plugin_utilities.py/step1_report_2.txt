  "purpose": "Provides configuration handling and directory filtering for plugins within a package/module system.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input or data reading functions are present in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No outputs or data sinks that could leak data or execute untrusted code are evident.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks identified; the code primarily documents the behavior of functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is incomplete, mainly consisting of comments and parameter descriptions, with no actual implementation or executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is purely descriptive, outlining functions that filter directories and handle plugin configurations based on package and module names. No actual code logic, data processing, or external calls are present. Without implementation, it cannot be assessed for malicious behavior, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation. The snippet does not contain any suspicious or malicious code structures, hardcoded secrets, or potentially harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available fragment, there are no signs of malicious intent, security risks, or obfuscation. The code appears to be documentation or partial function descriptions related to plugin configuration management, with no executable content to evaluate further.",
