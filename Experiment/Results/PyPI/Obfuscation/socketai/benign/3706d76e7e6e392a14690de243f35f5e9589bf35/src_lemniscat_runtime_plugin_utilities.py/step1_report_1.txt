{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to handle primary configuration for a given package and module, including filtering out unwanted directories and returning module names to import.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources are shown in the provided code snippet; the code likely relies on parameters such as 'plugins_package', 'package_name', and 'module_name'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs are explicitly shown; potential sink points could include dynamic imports or operations on the package/module names, but these are not visible in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Since the code does not show actual data flow or processing logic, flow analysis cannot be concretely determined from the provided fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The snippet contains only comments and parameter descriptions without executable code, making it impossible to identify unusual or malicious behavior directly.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet consists solely of comments describing the purpose of functions and their parameters, with no actual implementation. Without executable code, there are no visible sources, sinks, or flows. The absence of code also means no suspicious activity, backdoors, or malicious behaviors can be identified. The snippet appears to be documentation or a function outline, which in itself is safe and does not pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code is purely descriptive and lacks implementation details, so it cannot be evaluated for malicious intent or security issues.",
