  "purpose": "The code appears to handle configuration for a plugin system, filtering unwanted directories and managing module imports based on package and module names.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data reads are shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data leaks, system modifications, or network communications are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No identifiable source-to-sink data flow is present due to the absence of executable code or data handling logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet is incomplete and only contains docstrings or comments describing functions without actual implementation. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious behavior, or unusual code structures are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment consists solely of descriptive comments or function signatures with parameter descriptions. There is no executable logic, data handling, or interaction with external systems. As such, it cannot be evaluated for malicious activity or security risks based on the available information.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is purely descriptive and lacks any operational code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security issues within this fragment. However, without the actual implementation, a comprehensive security assessment cannot be performed.",
