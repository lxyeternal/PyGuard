{
  "purpose": "Importing internal modules/components with obfuscated names, likely for internal functionality or utilities.",
  "sources": "The import statements from local modules: .api, .wrappers, .utils",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this fragment.",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated module and class names, which could be used to conceal malicious code or intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. No executable logic, data flows, or external interactions are visible. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious activity. The low malware scores (0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the lack of evidence, while high obfuscation scores (0.7-0.8) reflect the suspicious naming. Security risk scores are moderate (0.2-0.4), aligning with the obfuscation concern. The reports correctly avoid overestimating threat levels and recommend further review of the imported modules to verify their contents. No logical flaws are evident; the cautious approach is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign in isolation but uses obfuscated names that warrant further inspection. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation could be used to hide malicious code. Scores are consistent with this assessment, emphasizing the need for additional review of the imported modules.",
