{
  "purpose": "Import modules and classes from internal packages, likely for further code execution or functionality.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes or functions from relative modules: .api, .wrappers, and .utils.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports suggest usage of imported classes/functions later, but no explicit flow is shown in this code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class names (e.g., FROcEbQZaFdtgEQhUYKXyfBXzjWAxQmW, TANpUjiiOfraSZnRqZiXgdQowNFmxfzQ, BnLyJjSABZwqZwPUqtuecNcdFQbyhnOp) which appear intentionally obscured, possibly to hide their true purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements with obfuscated class names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. No other logic, input handling, or data transmission is present in this fragment. While the imports alone are not inherently malicious, the obfuscation raises suspicion of potential malicious behavior or backdoors in the imported modules. No clear source-to-sink data flows are visible here, but the naming and structure suggest that these modules could be used to perform malicious actions elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is minimal and primarily consists of obfuscated import statements. This obfuscation is suspicious and warrants further review of the imported modules to determine their purpose. On its own, this code does not demonstrate malicious activity but exhibits signs that could be consistent with attempts to conceal malicious behavior.",
