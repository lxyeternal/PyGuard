  "purpose": "Importing specific classes or functions from internal modules, likely for use in the larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: .api, .wrappers, .utils",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or external communication; imports are static",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; code only contains import statements",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, seemingly obfuscated class/function names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality",
  "analysis": "The code imports three components from internal modules, with class/function names that appear to be random or obfuscated. There are no function calls, data handling, network operations, or other typical malicious behaviors present. The obfuscated-looking names could be an attempt at hiding malicious code or just a naming convention. Since this snippet contains only import statements, it is insufficient to determine malicious activity or security risks by itself. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident here.",
  "conclusion": "This fragment consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names, which raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious behavior. There is no direct evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks based solely on these imports. Further code review of the imported modules would be necessary to evaluate the overall security posture.",
