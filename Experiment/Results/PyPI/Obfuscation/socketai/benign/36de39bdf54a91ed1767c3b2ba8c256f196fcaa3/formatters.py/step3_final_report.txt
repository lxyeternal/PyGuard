{
  "purpose": "The code performs string manipulations such as replacing underscores with hyphens, splitting strings on underscores, capitalizing parts, and concatenating them, likely for formatting or normalization purposes.",
  "sources": "Input strings provided to the functions as parameters.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, file I/O, or environment interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input strings are processed through replacements, splits, and concatenations within the functions; no external or untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; no suspicious or malicious code behavior observed; operations are straightforward string manipulations.",
  "analysis": "The code performs benign string formatting operations with obfuscated naming. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The obfuscation may be to conceal purpose but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation score is high (~0.8), which aligns with the code's nature. Overall, the code appears safe and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated but harmless string manipulation functions with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
