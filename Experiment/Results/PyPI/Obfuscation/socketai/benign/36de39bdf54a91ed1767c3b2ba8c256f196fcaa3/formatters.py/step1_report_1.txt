{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform string manipulations, specifically replacing underscores with hyphens, splitting strings, and capitalizing parts of strings. It may be used for formatting or normalizing input strings.",
  "sources": "Input parameter vRUuogvoeCwnenfkxFkkheQsNeKbKtgj in all three functions",
  "sinks": "String operations within the functions; no external data sinks or network operations observed",
  "flows": "Input string → split into parts → modify parts (capitalize) → recombine with underscores or hyphens",
  "anomalies": "The function and variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, suggesting possible attempt to conceal purpose. The code uses string manipulation but no direct malicious actions such as network calls, file access, or environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of three functions: (1) replacing underscores with hyphens, (2) splitting a string at underscores, capitalizing parts after the first, and (3) formatting the string with underscores and further processing. All functions perform benign string operations. No inputs are used in unsafe ways, no data leaks, no external calls, no credential handling. The obfuscated variable names could be an attempt to conceal intent, but the logic itself is standard string processing without malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple string manipulations with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks within this code fragment. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purpose.",
