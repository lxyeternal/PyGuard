{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'django-strict-fields' package using importlib.metadata",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() call to read package version information",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that lead to data leaks or malicious effects",
  "flows": "Input (package name) to metadata.version() to get version info",
  "anomalies": "Variable name is unusual and obfuscated, but code performs a standard package metadata query without side effects",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'metadata' module from 'importlib' and calls 'metadata.version()' with the package name 'django-strict-fields'. The variable name used for storing the version string is non-descriptive and appears obfuscated. The operation itself is a straightforward retrieval of package metadata, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. No user input or external untrusted data sources are involved; the code solely queries package version info.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply retrieves the version of a specific Python package using standard library functions. No malicious activity or security risks are evident in this fragment. The obfuscated variable name does not indicate malicious intent but reduces code clarity.",
