  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'django-strict-fields' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() function call, reading the package version info",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data is written or transmitted untrusted data or to external systems",
  "flows": "Data flows from the metadata.version() source to the variable 'apwZWZAJXfdcdBOywKmwIjJBGSNWwzUT'",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name 'apwZWZAJXfdcdBOywKmwIjJBGSNWwzUT' is non-descriptive and obfuscated; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'metadata' module from 'importlib' and calls 'metadata.version()' to get the version of a specific package. The variable name used is highly obfuscated, which may suggest an attempt to hide intent, but functionally, this code simply retrieves package version info. No malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or execution of untrusted code, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code's primary function is to fetch the version of the specified package. The obfuscated variable name is suspicious but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No malware or malicious activity detected; the code appears benign.",
