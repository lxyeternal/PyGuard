  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'django-strict-fields' package using importlib.metadata",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version() function call, reading package metadata for 'django-strict-fields'",
  "sinks": "No sinks related to untrusted data or output; the code only reads package metadata",
  "flows": "Input is the package name 'django-strict-fields', which flows into the version retrieval function; result is stored in a variable",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical ('apwZWZAJXfdcdBOywKmwIjJBGSNWwzUT'), which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'metadata' module from importlib, then retrieves the version number of a package named 'django-strict-fields'. The variable name used to store the version is unusually obfuscated, which is suspicious. However, the operation itself is a standard package metadata query. No input from untrusted sources, no data leakage, no malicious network activity, or code injection present. The obfuscated variable name could be an attempt to hide the purpose or avoid detection, but the code logic is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple, legitimate operation—fetching a package version. The obfuscated variable name is suspicious but does not indicate malicious behavior or security risk. Overall, the code appears benign with a minor obfuscation anomaly.",
