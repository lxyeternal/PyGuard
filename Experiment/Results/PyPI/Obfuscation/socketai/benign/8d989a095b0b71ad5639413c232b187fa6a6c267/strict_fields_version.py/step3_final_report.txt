  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'django-strict-fields' package using importlib.metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the package metadata via importlib.metadata.version() call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; the code only retrieves package version info, with no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Source: importlib.metadata.version() call; Sink: storing the version string in an obfuscated variable.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable name, which may suggest concealment or obfuscation but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a benign operation: fetching package version metadata. The variable name is obfuscated, raising suspicion but not indicating malicious activity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The scores across reports correctly reflect the benign nature: malware score at 0, low security risk (~0.2), and moderate obfuscation suspicion (~0.6-0.7). The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity and consistency of the code. The primary concern is the variable name obfuscation, which warrants attention but does not constitute malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward package metadata query. The obfuscated variable name is suspicious but not malicious. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary beyond monitoring for obfuscation patterns in larger contexts.",
