{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes and version information from the 'strict_fields' package and define the module's exports.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the 'django' module, the 'strict_fields.fields' and 'strict_fields.version' modules, and the 'django.VERSION' attribute.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that lead to data leakage or security vulnerabilities; no execution of untrusted data.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes from a third-party package and conditionally sets a configuration string based on Django version; no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., UhzKwmYmLeygfmaAGZrUFpSOiirRoqib), which appear obfuscated or auto-generated; no explicit hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The script imports specific classes from 'strict_fields.fields' and a version module, then defines __all__ for exports. It checks Django's version and assigns a string to a variable if the version is below 3.2, which likely pertains to configuration. No untrusted input handling, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is apparent. The obfuscated variable names could be a form of code obscurity, but there is no evidence of malicious intent. The code appears to be a standard module setup with version-dependent configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign module setup that imports classes and version info, with no signs of malicious activity. The use of obfuscated variable names may suggest obfuscation or auto-generation but does not indicate malicious behavior.",
