{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific fields and version info from 'strict_fields', performs a Django version check, and cleans up the namespace. It appears to be a configuration or setup snippet.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'strict_fields.fields' and 'strict_fields.version', and the Django version check.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, network calls, or data leaks are present; no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "The version check influences the setting of a configuration variable; imports are static and do not involve data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import class names and variable names (e.g., 'UhzKwmYmLeygfmaAGZrUFpSOiirRoqib', 'pQqnwzLQLTcmHZXJaUOPTogRFZufHEZc') are suspicious and suggest obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard imports and a version check, then deletes the 'django' reference. The import names and variable are non-descriptive, which could be intentional obfuscation. No malicious actions, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious intent. The malware score should be low (0.0-0.2), reflecting no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation score is higher (around 0.7), consistent with the suspicious naming. The overall security risk remains low (around 0.2), as the code appears benign but obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration snippet with obfuscated import and variable names, likely for internal naming or concealment. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not justify high malware or risk scores.",
