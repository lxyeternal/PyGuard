  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** Suspicious import names (non-descriptive, seemingly random), obfuscated variable name, import of entire modules without clear usage.\n- **Analysis:** While no malicious activity is evident, the obfuscated naming and import patterns are suspicious, possibly indicating concealment or malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0.2 reflects some concern but not high. Obfuscated at 0.7 indicates significant suspicion. Security risk at 0.3 is moderate.\n- **Conclusion:** The cautious approach is justified; obfuscation warrants further review, but no direct evidence of malware.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar obfuscated import names, no malicious behavior observed.\n- **Analysis:** Obfuscation could be for internal naming or concealment, but no malicious activity is apparent.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0.0 aligns with no malicious activity. Obfuscated at 0.7 still high, but less concern about malware.\n- **Conclusion:** No immediate threat; obfuscation remains suspicious but benign in this context.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated import names, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard import and version check, just with unusual naming.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0.0, obfuscated at 0.2 (low), security risk at 0.1.\n- **Conclusion:** Likely benign, possibly just non-descriptive naming.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated import names, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Similar to above, standard setup with suspicious naming.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, obfuscated at 0.8 (very high), security risk at 0.2.\n- **Justification for high obfuscation score:** The high obfuscation score is justified given the non-descriptive, auto-generated style names, which could hide malicious code.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated variable names, no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis:** Standard import and version check, obfuscation present but no malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** Malware at 0, obfuscated at 0.7, security risk at 0.1.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports consistently show no evidence of malicious activity. The highest malware suspicion (Report 1) is 0.2, which seems reasonable given the obfuscation but no direct malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** The import names and variable names are consistently non-descriptive and appear auto-generated or obfuscated. The scores of 0.7 or 0.8 across reports seem appropriate.\n- **Risk Score:** Overall, the code appears benign but suspicious due to obfuscation. The risk scores of around 0.1 to 0.3 are appropriate, reflecting cautious suspicion but no confirmed threat.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The **malware score** should remain low, around **0.1** at most, given no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** should stay high, around **0.7-0.8**, due to the suspicious naming.\n- The **risk score** should be around **0.2**, reflecting cautious suspicion.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Summary:**\n\n| Metric             | Estimated Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | **0.1**         |\n| Obfuscated         | **0.75**        |\n| Security Risk      | **0.2**         |\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is likely benign but employs obfuscation that warrants further review of the 'strict_fields' package. No direct malware or malicious behavior is evident, but the naming conventions are suspicious enough to justify cautious monitoring.",
