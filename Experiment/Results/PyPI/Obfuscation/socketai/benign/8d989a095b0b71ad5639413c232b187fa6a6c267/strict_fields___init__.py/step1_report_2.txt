{
  "purpose": "Import specific classes and version information from the 'strict_fields' library for use in a Django project configuration.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'strict_fields.fields' and 'strict_fields.version' modules; the 'django' module for version checking.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "Imports are static and do not process untrusted data; the only conditional logic checks Django version.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import names such as 'UhzKwmYmLeygfmaAGZrUFpSOiirRoqib' and 'oSLSbIxITaYOrrwynfjujsoWlqiZEkFM' which appear to be obfuscated or randomly generated identifiers; no clear purpose for such imports. The variable name 'pQqnwzLQLTcmHZXJaUOPTogRFZufHEZc' is also obfuscated. The code has no comments explaining these identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific classes with seemingly random or obfuscated names from 'strict_fields.fields', and a version constant. It also performs a Django version check to set a configuration string, then deletes the 'django' module reference. No execution of untrusted code, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscated names suggest possible concealment, but without malicious intent evident in this snippet. The version check is benign, intended for configuration purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a configuration/setup snippet with obfuscated import names, possibly for security through obscurity or internal naming conventions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or malicious code execution. The obfuscation is suspicious but not necessarily malicious in this context.",
