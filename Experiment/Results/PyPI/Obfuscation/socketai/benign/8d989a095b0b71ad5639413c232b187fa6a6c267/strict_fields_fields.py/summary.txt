  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign configuration and utility code with obfuscated identifiers. No direct malicious activity is evident. The main concern is the external helper functions, which should be inspected for malicious behavior. The current low malware and security risk scores are appropriate, but vigilance is advised pending further review of helpers."
