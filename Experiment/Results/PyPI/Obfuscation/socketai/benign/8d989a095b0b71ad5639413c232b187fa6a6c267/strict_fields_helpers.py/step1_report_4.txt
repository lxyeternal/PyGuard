{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to check whether a datetime object is timezone-aware or naive.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters passed into the functions (value, datetime_or_time).",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks for untrusted data, no data is written to external systems or transmitted over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are validated; functions raise errors based on the datetime's timezone awareness status. No external data flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "The functions perform standard validation checks with no signs of obfuscation, malicious data handling, or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines functions to verify if a datetime object is timezone-aware or naive. It validates input types and raises errors if the datetime's timezone awareness does not match expectations. No external data sources or sinks are involved, and there are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The code appears to be a simple utility for datetime validation, with no suspicious constructs or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward datetime validation logic with no malicious intent or security risks detected. It functions as a utility to ensure datetime objects have the correct timezone awareness. There is no evidence of malware, data leakage, or malicious activity.",
