{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be utility functions for checking whether a datetime object is timezone-aware or naive.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, specifically datetime objects passed into the functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is written or transmitted; mainly validation and raising exceptions.",
  "flows": "Input datetime objects are validated to check their timezone awareness status; no data flow outside validation occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The code performs straightforward timezone awareness checks without any obfuscated constructs or hidden logic. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The functions validate whether provided datetime objects are timezone-aware or naive, raising errors if conditions are not met. The code is simple, with no network activity, data leaks, or manipulation. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is well-structured, with clear purpose and no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility functions for datetime validation, with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
