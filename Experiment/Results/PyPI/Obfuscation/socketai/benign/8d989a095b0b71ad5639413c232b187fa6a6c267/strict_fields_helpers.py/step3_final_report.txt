  "flows": "Input 'value' is checked for type and timezone awareness/naiveness, raising exceptions if conditions are not met",
  "anomalies": "Function names are non-descriptive and appear obfuscated; no malicious or suspicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward datetime validation: type checking and timezone awareness validation. No external data access, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation is superficial, only evident in function names, but does not imply malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with high confidence levels. Malware scores are appropriately zero; security risk scores are minimal (~0.1). The obfuscation score could be slightly lowered, but current assessments are acceptable.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for datetime validation with superficial obfuscation. No malicious behavior or supply chain risk is present. The scores are consistent with the code's behavior, and no further action is necessary.",
