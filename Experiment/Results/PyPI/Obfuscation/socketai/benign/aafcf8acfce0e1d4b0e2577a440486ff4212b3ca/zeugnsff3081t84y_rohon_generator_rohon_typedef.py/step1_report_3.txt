{
  "purpose": "Definition of various data types as string, char, int, or double for use in a trading or financial system.",
  "sources": "Type declarations primarily assigning string, char, int, or double to variable names that serve as type aliases.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present; the code consists solely of type alias definitions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink exists; the code only establishes type aliases without executable logic.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code present. The structure is purely type alias declarations with no functions, input/output operations, or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code systematically defines type aliases for various data fields used in a trading system, likely for standardization and readability. There are no executable statements, input/output, network connections, or dynamic code execution. The lack of any operational code, obfuscated logic, or suspicious data handling indicates an absence of malicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward set of type definitions, serving as a foundation for other modules.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains only type alias declarations for data fields used in a trading platform, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely structural, providing data type consistency across the application.",
