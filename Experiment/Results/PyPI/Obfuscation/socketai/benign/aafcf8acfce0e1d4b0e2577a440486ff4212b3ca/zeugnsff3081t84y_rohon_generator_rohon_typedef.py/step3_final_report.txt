{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of type alias declarations for various data fields used in a trading or financial system, serving as schema definitions or interfaces.",
  "sources": "The code reads no input or external data; it only declares static type aliases.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or untrusted data flows; the code contains no executable logic or data transmission.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code is purely declarative with no runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present; the code appears systematic and likely auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static type alias declarations mapping identifiers to primitive types (string, int, double, char). It contains no executable code, data processing, or network operations. The naming conventions suggest schema definitions for a trading system. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. The code's static nature and lack of data flow indicate no security risks. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's benign, structural purpose.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign, static set of type alias declarations serving as schema definitions for a trading system. It poses no security threat, malware, or obfuscation risk. All reports correctly identify its non-executable, structural nature. The current scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are justified and appropriate.",
