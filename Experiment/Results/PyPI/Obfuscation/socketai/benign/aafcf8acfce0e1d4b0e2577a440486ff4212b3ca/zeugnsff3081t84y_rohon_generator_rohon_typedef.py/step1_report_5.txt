  "purpose": "Definition of data types (mostly aliases) for various string, char, int, and double types used throughout a trading or financial system.",
  "sources": "Type alias assignments; no input or data reading sources evident.",
  "sinks": "No explicit data sinks or untrusted data handling points present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; primarily type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious constructs. No code execution, network calls, or data leaks observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias declarations mapping identifiers to primitive types such as string, int, char, or double. These serve as type definitions for a larger system. There are no functions, control flows, or data handling logic. No signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or suspicious behavior are present. The code is straightforward and adheres to typical coding patterns for defining domain-specific types.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of type alias definitions used for clarity and consistency in a financial trading system. It contains no malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign, structural part of a larger codebase. No evidence of malware or security threats found.",
