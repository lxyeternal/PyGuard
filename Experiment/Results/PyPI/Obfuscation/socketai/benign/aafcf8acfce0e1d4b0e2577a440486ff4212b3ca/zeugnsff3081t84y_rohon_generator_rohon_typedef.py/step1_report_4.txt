  "purpose": "Definition of type aliases for various data fields used in a trading system, primarily for data consistency and clarity.",
  "sources": "No input sources; all are type alias declarations.",
  "sinks": "No data processing or handling; no sinks for untrusted data are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this is solely type alias declarations.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists of a comprehensive list of type definitions with no executable logic, code injection, or data handling. There are no obfuscated elements or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple type aliases for data fields used within a financial trading context. These are static declarations assigning string, char, int, double types to descriptive identifiers, likely to enforce data consistency across a larger codebase. No runtime or input/output logic is present. The content appears to be a structured, static schema of data types relevant to trading operations, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, network connections, or code that could perform harmful actions are evident. The format is uniform, and the definitions serve as a data schema or interface layer.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static set of type alias declarations for data fields in a trading system, with no malicious code, backdoors, or security risks identified. It appears to be a standard, well-structured schema definition.",
