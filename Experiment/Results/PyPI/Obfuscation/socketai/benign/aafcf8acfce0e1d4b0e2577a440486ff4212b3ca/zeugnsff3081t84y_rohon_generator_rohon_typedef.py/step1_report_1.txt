{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of type aliases for various string, int, double, and char types used throughout a larger Python application, likely related to trading or financial data handling.",
  "sources": "The code sources data from hardcoded type definitions, constants, and potentially configuration settings for a trading system.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include areas where these types are used in data processing, network communication, or storage functions, but no direct data flows are shown here.",
  "flows": "No data flow logic is present; these are only type definitions. There are no source-to-sink flows demonstrated in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, such as obfuscated code, hidden backdoors, or suspicious behaviors, are present. The code solely consists of type alias declarations.",
  "analysis": "This fragment is a collection of type alias declarations for various string, integer, double, and char types, likely used for defining data structures in a trading platform. There are no executable statements, function calls, or data manipulations. The naming suggests a comprehensive and systematic approach to data typing. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious logic are detected. The code appears to be a standard, organized setup for data type definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely declarative, defining type aliases without any executable or data-processing behavior. It poses no security threats or malicious intent, serving as foundational type definitions for a larger system.",
