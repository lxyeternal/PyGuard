  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies these as type aliases for trading/financial data.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or data sinks, only static definitions.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious patterns; appears straightforward.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that these are purely type definitions with no malicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above, clear type alias definitions.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No executable code or data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation or malicious intent; likely auto-generated.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes the static, schema-like nature.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same pattern, defining data types for a trading system.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing or I/O.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Consistent with previous assessments; purely structural.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static type alias declarations.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious indicators or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies as schema definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Type alias definitions for a trading system.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Properly states these are benign, structural definitions.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Code Content:** Entirely composed of static type alias declarations, with no executable code, data flow, or dynamic behavior.\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:** No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation detected.\n- **Security Risk:** None apparent; these are foundational data type definitions.\n\n### Final Justification:\nGiven the nature of this code—just static, descriptive type aliases for a trading system—there's no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk. All reports correctly identify this as benign schema-like code.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis code is purely declarative, serving as a schema or interface layer, and does not pose any threat.\n\n**Conclusion:** The current assessments are accurate. No adjustments needed.",
