  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code snippet.\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n- The code is a comprehensive list of type alias declarations, mapping identifiers to basic data types (string, int, double, char).\n- No executable code, functions, data processing, or dynamic logic.\n- The naming conventions suggest a structured schema for a trading or financial system.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose:** Describes the code as type aliases for trading/financial data.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as purely declarative, with no executable logic or data flow.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity or security threats.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0/0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing data type definitions for a trading system.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly notes the absence of data flow, sinks, or executable code.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent or obfuscation; appears auto-generated or schema-like.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0/0\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent with the code. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose:** Reiterates the code as data type definitions for a trading platform.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states that the code is static, with no runtime or input/output logic, and no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0/0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose:** Similar to previous reports, focusing on data schema.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies the code as static type alias declarations with no operational or malicious elements.\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malicious behavior or security threats.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0/0\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose:** Again, describes the code as data type definitions.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly states there are no functions, data handling, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** Benign, structural schema definitions.\n- **Confidence:** 1.0\n- **Malware/Obfuscated:** 0/0\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Findings:\n- All reports consistently identify the code as static, non-executable type alias declarations.\n- No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or secret data.\n- The type definitions appear systematic and possibly auto-generated, serving as a schema or interface layer for a trading system.\n\n### Final Security Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation or suspicious patterns)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n### Justification:\n- The code is purely declarative, serving as a schema or interface.\n- No executable logic, data flow, or external data sources.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or network operations.\n- No obfuscation or suspicious constructs.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion:**\nBased on the provided code and reports, I concur with the assessments that this is a benign, schema-like set of type alias declarations with no security threats.\n\n**My estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis code is a standard, non-malicious foundation for a larger trading system, posing no security concerns.",
