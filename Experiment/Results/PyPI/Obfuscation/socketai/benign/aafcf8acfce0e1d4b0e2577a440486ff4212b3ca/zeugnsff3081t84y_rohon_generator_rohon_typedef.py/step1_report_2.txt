{
  "purpose": "Definition of type aliases for various string, int, double, and char data types used throughout a larger system, likely for a trading or financial application.",
  "sources": "No direct data input sources are present; these are type alias definitions for later use in code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; the code consists solely of type alias declarations, with no data processing or untrusted data flow.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows; these are static type alias definitions without executable or data manipulation logic.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a comprehensive set of type alias definitions, potentially auto-generated, with no unusual or suspicious constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a large number of type alias assignments that define various string, int, double, and char types associated with financial and trading concepts. It appears to be part of a schema or interface specification, likely for a trading platform or API, with no executable code, data processing, or input/output handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, data leakage, or obfuscated code. The structure and naming conventions suggest systematic auto-generation rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of type alias definitions for a financial or trading system, designed for clarity and consistency in data handling. It does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. The code is straightforward, primarily serving as a schema or interface definition.",
