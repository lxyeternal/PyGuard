  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the provided code snippet and applying critical security review principles.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that these are type alias definitions for a trading system.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Accurately notes that the code is purely declarative, with no executable logic or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately concludes that there's no malicious intent, with full confidence.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report is accurate. The code is straightforward type alias declarations with no signs of obfuscation or malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states these are type aliases for a system, likely auto-generated.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** Recognizes the systematic nature and lack of executable code or suspicious constructs.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately finds no malicious behavior, with high confidence.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report correctly interprets the code as a schema or interface definition, with no security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes these are type aliases for data fields in a trading system.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious patterns are detected.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately states that the code is benign and structural.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis is an accurate, thorough review with no security issues identified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies static type definitions.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes the code is a standard schema.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis review is consistent and accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**  \n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes these are type alias declarations.  \n- **Analysis & Anomalies:** No malicious payloads, obfuscation, or data leaks observed.  \n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Appropriately deems the code benign.\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThis report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Cross-Analysis & Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:**  \n  The code is purely a collection of type alias definitions—no executable code, no data flow, no network activity, no obfuscation, and no embedded secrets or credentials.\n\n- **Malware & Obfuscation:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that there is no malware, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n- **Security Risks:**  \n  Given the static, declarative nature, the code itself does not pose any security risk.\n\n- **Scores & Justification:**  \n  The initial scores for malware and obfuscation are all zero, which aligns with the analysis. The risk scores are also appropriately low.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Overall Malware Score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThese scores are consistent with the evidence and analysis. The code appears to be a standard, auto-generated set of type definitions serving as a schema or interface layer for a trading system.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll reports are accurate and comprehensive. No malicious or suspicious activity is present in this code snippet. It is a benign, structural part of a larger system, serving as a foundation for data consistency.\n\n**Final Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the detailed review and the nature of the code.",
