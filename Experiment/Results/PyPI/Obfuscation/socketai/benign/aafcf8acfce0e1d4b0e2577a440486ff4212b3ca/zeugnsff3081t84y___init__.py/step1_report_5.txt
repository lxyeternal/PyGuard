{
  "purpose": "Provide different API interface classes based on the input interface name",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'interface_name' to determine which import statements and classes to return",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing class objects; no data output or network communication",
  "flows": "Input parameter -> conditional logic -> import statements -> return classes",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual behavior observed. Imports are conditional and local, not dynamic or external. No obfuscated code or hidden functionality.",
  "analysis": "The function conditionally imports specific classes from modules based on the 'interface_name' parameter. The imports are localized within the function scope, which is acceptable in Python and does not pose a security risk by itself. No data leaks, external network activity, or malicious code are present. The code is straightforward, and the only potential concern might be importing from modules that could be compromised, but this is outside the scope of this module. The use of 'raise' for unsupported interfaces is standard practice.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple factory-like function that imports and returns specific classes based on the input parameter. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks within this code segment.",
