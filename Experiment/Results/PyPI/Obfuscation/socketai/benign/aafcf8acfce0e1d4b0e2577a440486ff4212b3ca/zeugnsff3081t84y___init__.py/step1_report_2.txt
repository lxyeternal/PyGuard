  "purpose": "Function to dynamically import and return specific API classes based on the provided interface name.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'interface_name' that determines which API classes to import.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that output classes based on imported modules.",
  "flows": "Input 'interface_name' -> conditional checks -> module imports -> return of API classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports within function calls, which is normal; no suspicious hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The function performs straightforward conditional imports based on the input parameter. It imports specific classes from different modules and returns them. No external data sources, untrusted inputs beyond the function argument, or suspicious behavior such as network communication, file manipulation, or hidden code. The import statements are standard and contextual. No signs of malicious behavior or sabotage are present. The code appears to be a simple factory function for API class retrieval.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dynamic import pattern used for modular API access. It shows no evidence of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It is a benign utility function for class importation.",
