  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports agree that the code is a straightforward conditional import pattern.\n- No suspicious behaviors such as code injection, data exfiltration, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation are identified.\n- The import statements are within conditional blocks, which is standard for modular imports.\n- The function raises an exception for unsupported interfaces, which is normal.\n\n**Scores and their Justification:**\n\n1. **Malware Score (all reports):**  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no evidence of malicious code or behavior. This is consistent and justified.\n\n2. **Obfuscated Score:**  \n   All reports assign 0, correctly indicating no obfuscation.\n\n3. **Security Risk Score:**  \n   The reports assign a low score (~0.1), justified by the fact that the code performs simple imports without external data or network activity. The minor risk could be due to potential import of malicious modules, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n\n4. **Purpose and Logic:**  \n   The code is a typical factory pattern for API class imports, with no signs of malicious intent.\n\n**Potential Issues or Concerns:**\n- The reports mention that the import modules could be malicious if compromised, but this is a general concern with dependencies, not the code itself.\n- No indication of obfuscation or malicious behavior.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is benign, standard, and safe.\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- No modifications to scores are necessary.\n\n**My Final Assessment:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward code)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (minimal, based on dependency trust assumptions)\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe code is a standard, safe factory function for API class imports with no security risks evident from the snippet provided.",
