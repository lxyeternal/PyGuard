  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Functionality Confirmation:**\n   - The code is a straightforward factory function that imports specific API classes based on the string `interface_name`.\n   - It raises an exception if the interface name isn't recognized.\n   - The imports are within conditional blocks, which is a common pattern to avoid unnecessary imports.\n   - There are no signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets.\n\n2. **Assessment of Security and Malicious Indicators:**\n   - All reports agree that the code performs benign, standard conditional imports.\n   - No evidence of data leaks, network activity, or malicious behavior.\n   - The only potential concern is if the imported modules themselves are malicious, but that is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n   - The use of local imports within functions is typical and not inherently risky.\n\n3. **Scores Evaluation:**\n   - **Malware Score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the analysis. There are no signs of malicious code.\n   - **Obfuscated Score:** All reports assign 0, consistent with the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - **Security Risk Score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in most reports, justified by the fact that the function imports modules based on input. However, since the input is a controlled string and the imports are static, this is minimal.\n\n4. **Potential Issues in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent and reasonable; they do not overstate or understate the risks.\n   - The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n   - No report suggests any suspicious logic or hidden malicious intent.\n\n5. **Overall Justification:**\n   - The code appears to be a benign, standard implementation of a factory pattern for importing classes.\n   - No modifications or obfuscations are present.\n   - The scores reflect the actual risk level accurately.\n\n**Final Recommendations:**\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should remain at 0.\n- **Risk Score:** Given the benign nature, a very low risk score (e.g., 0.1) is appropriate, reflecting minimal concern about the import pattern.\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is safe, straightforward, and performs no malicious actions.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature.\n- No changes are necessary to the scores or conclusions.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (due to dynamic import pattern, but benign in this context)\n\nThis aligns with the detailed analysis above.",
