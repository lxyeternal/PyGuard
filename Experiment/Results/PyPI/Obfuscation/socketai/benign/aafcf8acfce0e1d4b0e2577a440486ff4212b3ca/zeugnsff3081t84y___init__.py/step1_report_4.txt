  "purpose": "This function dynamically imports and returns specific API classes based on the provided interface name.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'interface_name' determines which branch of code executes; import statements inside conditional blocks.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing classes; potential for dynamic class handling if misused with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Input 'interface_name' flows through conditional checks, leading to specific import statements, and then returns the imported classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports inside function scope; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code. No obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The function conditionally imports specific API classes based on the string provided. Imports are localized within conditionals, which is standard practice for dynamic imports in Python. No use of external untrusted data sources, no suspicious code patterns, nor any malicious behavior or obfuscation. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose of returning appropriate classes based on user input. No hardcoded secrets or insecure behaviors are evident. The import statements are straightforward and confined within conditions, minimizing risk of unintended code execution.\n\nOverall, the code is simple, clear, and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs conditional imports based on the interface name, which appears to be a legitimate pattern. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It is a straightforward utility function for dynamic API class retrieval.",
