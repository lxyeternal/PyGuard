  "purpose": "Factory function to import and return specific API classes based on interface name",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'interface_name' used to determine which modules to import",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; imports are static within conditional blocks",
  "flows": "Input 'interface_name' controls which classes are imported and returned",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; standard conditional imports, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward conditional imports based on a string parameter, returning specific classes or raising an error for unsupported names. Imports are localized within functions, avoiding global side effects. No malicious code, data leaks, or obfuscation are present. The modules imported are external dependencies, but their safety cannot be assessed from this snippet alone. The pattern is common and benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard factory pattern for importing API classes. No malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are evident. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a minimal security risk score (~0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
