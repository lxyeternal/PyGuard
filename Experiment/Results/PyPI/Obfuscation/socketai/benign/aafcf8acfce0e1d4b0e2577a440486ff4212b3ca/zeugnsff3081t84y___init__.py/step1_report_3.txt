  "purpose": "Function to dynamically import and return specific API classes based on the provided interface name.",
  "sources": "The input parameter 'interface_name' that determines which API modules to import.",
  "sinks": "The import statements that load modules and classes based on the input value.",
  "flows": "Input 'interface_name' -> conditional check -> corresponding import statements -> return API classes.",
  "anomalies": "Standard conditional import pattern; no suspicious or malicious code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically imports specific classes from modules based on the 'interface_name' argument. The imports are straightforward and limited to known modules; no user data or untrusted input is processed beyond the string comparison. The function raises an exception for unsupported interfaces, which is normal. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. The imports are standard and intended for modular API usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical dynamic import function for selecting API classes based on input. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and standard for modular Python code.",
