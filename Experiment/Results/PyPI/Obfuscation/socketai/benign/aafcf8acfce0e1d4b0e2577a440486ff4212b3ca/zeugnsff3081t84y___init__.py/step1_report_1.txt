  "purpose": "Function to import and return specific API classes based on the interface name provided.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'interface_name' and inline module imports.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing class references; no untrusted data output or external data effects.",
  "flows": "Input 'interface_name' -> conditional branches -> imported classes -> return.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. The imports are conditional and based on input; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed.",
  "analysis": "The function conditionally imports specific API classes based on a string input. It raises an error for unsupported interface names. The import statements are within conditional blocks, which is a common pattern to avoid unnecessary imports. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code does not execute external commands or access sensitive data. The only concern might be if the imported modules themselves are malicious, but from this snippet, that cannot be determined. Overall, this appears to be a standard factory function for API class imports.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs straightforward conditional imports based on input; no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It is a typical pattern for modular imports without evident security risks.",
