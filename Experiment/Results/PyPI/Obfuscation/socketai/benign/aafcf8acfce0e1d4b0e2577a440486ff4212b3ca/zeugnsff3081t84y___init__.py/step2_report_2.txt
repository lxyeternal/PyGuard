  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code Summary:**\nThe function `get_interface` takes a string `interface_name` and conditionally imports specific classes from modules, then returns them. It raises an error if the interface is unsupported. The imports are within conditional blocks, a common pattern to avoid unnecessary imports.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed Issues:\n- The code performs straightforward conditional imports based on input; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident.\n- The import modules are external dependencies, but their maliciousness cannot be determined from this snippet alone.\n- No evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or other malicious behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears benign and standard for modular API class retrieval.\n\n---\n\n### Flaws or Mistakes in the Reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the pattern as a straightforward, benign factory function.\n- They consistently note the absence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.\n- The reports assign high confidence levels (mostly 0.9 or 1), which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity.\n\n**No significant logical flaws or reasoning mistakes are evident in the reports.**\n\n---\n\n### Scores and Justifications:\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0 or very low (0.1). This aligns with the analysis—no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, which is appropriate; no obfuscation is present.\n- **Security Risk Score:** Mostly 0.1 or 0, reflecting minimal concern, which is reasonable.\n\n**However,** the security risk scores are slightly above zero, possibly due to the dynamic import pattern. While common, dynamic imports can sometimes be exploited if input is untrusted. In this case, the input is a controlled string, and the code raises errors for unsupported inputs, so the risk remains low.\n\n---\n\n### Potential Overestimations:\n- The reports' scores seem reasonable; no overestimation or underestimation is evident.\n- The high confidence levels are justified given the code's simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (minimal, standard pattern, no evident vulnerabilities)\n\n---\n\n### Additional Comments:\n- The only minor concern could be if the imported modules themselves are malicious, but this is outside the scope of this code snippet.\n- The code's pattern is common and acceptable; no security issues are apparent.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- The code is benign, with no malicious or suspicious behavior.\n- The assigned scores are appropriate, but could be slightly lowered to zero for malware and obfuscated if desired, considering the lack of any obfuscation or malicious activity.\n\n**Final recommendation:**  \nMaintain the scores as is, or adjust malware and obfuscated scores to 0, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**Overall, I concur with the reports' assessments.**",
