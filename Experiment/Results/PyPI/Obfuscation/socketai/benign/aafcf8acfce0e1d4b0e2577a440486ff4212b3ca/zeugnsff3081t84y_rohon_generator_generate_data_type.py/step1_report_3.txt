  "purpose": "The script converts C/C++ header definitions into Python constants and type definitions.",
  "sources": "Reads lines from a specified C/C++ header file ('../include/rohon/ThostFtdcUserApiDataType.h')",
  "sinks": "Writes processed data into Python files ('rohon_constant.py' and 'rohon_typedef.py')",
  "flows": "Reads header file lines -> Processes lines -> Extracts defines and typedefs -> Writes Python code",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns. No external network activity, no code obfuscation, or suspicious function calls.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward parsing of C header files to generate Python constants and type mappings. It only reads from a file and writes to output files, with no network activity, code injection, or manipulation of untrusted data. It does not execute or import any external or dynamic code. No obfuscated or malicious patterns are present. The operations are standard and controlled, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility script for code conversion with no malicious behavior. It safely processes input files and generates Python files without any suspicious activity or security risks.",
