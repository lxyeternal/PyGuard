{
  "purpose": "The code converts C++ typedefs and #define constants from a header file into Python variable definitions, generating Python files for data types and constants.",
  "sources": "File input: reads lines from a specified C++ header file; No other external input sources.",
  "sinks": "Writing to output Python files (_constant.py and _typedef.py). No untrusted data is written directly to sensitive areas or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Reads header file lines -> processes #define or typedef statements -> writes corresponding Python variable definitions to files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code performs straightforward parsing and writing without obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The script performs simple text processing: opening files, reading lines, and parsing specific C++ constructs. It maps typedefs and constants to Python variables. No dynamic code execution, network communication, or sensitive data handling occurs. No anomalies or malicious patterns identified. The process is limited to file I/O and string manipulation, with no indication of malicious intent or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing a straightforward conversion of header file definitions to Python variables without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
