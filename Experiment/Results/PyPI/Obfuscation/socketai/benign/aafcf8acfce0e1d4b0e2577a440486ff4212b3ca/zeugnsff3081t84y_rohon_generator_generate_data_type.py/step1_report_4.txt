{
  "purpose": "The script converts C header definitions and typedefs into Python variable assignments for data type mappings and constants.",
  "sources": "Reads input from a C header file ('../include/rohon/ThostFtdcUserApiDataType.h') line by line.",
  "sinks": "Writes to Python files ('rohon_constant.py' and 'rohon_typedef.py') with generated variable assignments.",
  "flows": "Input header file lines (defines and typedefs) -> process_line -> process_define/process_typedef -> write to output Python files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration present. The code simply parses and transforms input data.",
  "analysis": "The code reads a specified C header file, processes lines starting with '#define' or 'typedef', and writes corresponding Python variable assignments to output files. The process appears straightforward and intended for data conversion. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as system commands, network calls, or credential handling are detected. The code performs file I/O, string parsing, and data mapping without executing or loading external or untrusted data beyond the input header. The overall logic is benign and consistent with a data processing utility.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign data transformation utility converting C header constants and typedefs into Python variables. There are no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks present.",
