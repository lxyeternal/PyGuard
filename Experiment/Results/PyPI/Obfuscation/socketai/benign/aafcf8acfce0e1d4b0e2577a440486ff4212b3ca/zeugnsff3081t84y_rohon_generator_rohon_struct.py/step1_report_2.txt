  "purpose": "Definitions of data structures (fields) used in a Python trading system's API, primarily for financial transactions, user management, and market data.",
  "sources": "Data fields in dictionary-like structures, which may be used as input parameters or response objects in API calls.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network operations, file I/O, or system commands are present; the code mainly defines data schemas.",
  "flows": "No active data flow or untrusted data processing occurs within this code snippet; it is purely structural definitions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behaviors identified. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hidden logic. All structures are straightforward data schema definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of dictionary-like definitions outlining data structures for a trading system API. There are no executable functions, network calls, or dynamic code execution. It includes sensitive-looking fields like passwords, account info, and transaction details, but these are part of schema definitions, not actual data handling or malicious code. No anomalies, suspicious functions, or suspicious usage patterns are detected. No indication of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system manipulation within these definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a set of data structure definitions for a trading system API, intended for data transfer and system operations. It contains no active or executable malicious behavior. No security risks or malware signatures are detected. The presence of sensitive field names (passwords, account info) is typical for such schemas and does not imply malicious intent.",
