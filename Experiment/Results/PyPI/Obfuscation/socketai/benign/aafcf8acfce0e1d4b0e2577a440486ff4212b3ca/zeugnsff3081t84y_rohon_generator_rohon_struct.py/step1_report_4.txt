  "purpose": "Definition of data structures for a trading and financial services API, including user authentication, order management, transfer, and account operations.",
  "sources": "No active data sources; all are static data structure definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; code only declares data formats and fields.",
  "flows": "No data flow, input/output, or data processing logic; only data structure schemas.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code strictly defines data structures with no executable or dynamic code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of Python dictionaries defining data fields and types for various trading, account, and transaction-related structures. There are no functions, executable statements, or data handling logic. The presence of sensitive fields such as passwords, passwords flags, and personal info is notable but expected in this context; however, these fields should be handled securely elsewhere in the application. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected. No evidence of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or exploit attempts within the schema definitions.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a schema or data structure definitions for a financial trading system, with no executable code or logic. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks. The presence of sensitive fields suggests the need for secure handling but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, this code is a benign schema declaration with no security concerns.",
