  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the provided code and the assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as static constant mappings for a financial system.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic data handling or external data flows; purely static.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, malicious logic, or suspicious features detected.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid assessment, high confidence (0.9), malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No issues detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as static constant assignments.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No untrusted data handling; static configuration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or hidden logic.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly concludes the code is benign, with a perfect confidence score (1), malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct and comprehensive. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly states that these are constant mappings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing involved.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No malicious or obfuscated features, purely static constants.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Valid conclusion, with full confidence (1), malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes that these are static constants.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic or external data involved.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or secrets.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Properly states the code is benign, with full confidence (1), malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Accurately describes the code as static constant mappings.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No external data handling.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No obfuscation, secrets, or malicious features.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** Correctly identifies the code as a benign constants module, with high confidence (0.95), malware score 0.\n\n**Verdict:** Valid and well-founded.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- All reports agree that the code is static, benign, and contains no malicious or obfuscated elements.\n- The malware scores are consistently 0 across all reports, aligning with the analysis.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting the static nature and lack of suspicious features.\n\n### Final Expert Assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation present)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (negligible, as it’s purely static configuration data)\n\n**Justification:** The code is a large collection of constant mappings for a financial system, with no dynamic execution, no external input handling, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. It functions as a configuration or enumeration module, which is common and safe in such contexts.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate, and the code is safe. No security risks or malware concerns are present.",
