{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of constant mappings for a financial trading system, including identifiers, statuses, types, and configurations used throughout the application.",
  "sources": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with hardcoded string values; no input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "There are no data sinks or data flows involving untrusted input, external output, or external system interactions within this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink pathways are present, as the code only initializes constants.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely a large list of static constant definitions with no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded secrets such as credentials, API keys, or passwords are visible. No backdoors or hidden behaviors are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration of constants used for enumerations, status codes, and type identifiers in a trading system. It is well-structured, consistent, and devoid of any runtime logic, user input handling, or system interaction. The absence of dynamic code, evaluation, or external data processing minimizes risk. No anomalies like embedded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code functions solely as a static constants module providing predefined mappings for a trading platform. There are no signs of malicious behavior, no external data interactions, and no security vulnerabilities detected within this fragment.",
