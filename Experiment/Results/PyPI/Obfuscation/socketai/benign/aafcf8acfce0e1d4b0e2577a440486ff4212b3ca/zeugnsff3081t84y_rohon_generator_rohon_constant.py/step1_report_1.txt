{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of constant mappings for various financial, trading, and system parameters used in a trading platform or financial system.",
  "sources": "These are hardcoded string mappings assigned to variables, which serve as lookup tables for different codes and their meanings within the system.",
  "sinks": "There are no dynamic data inputs, user inputs, or external data sources; the code does not process untrusted data or involve data flow that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; these are static constant definitions without any runtime data manipulation or user input handling.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be a static collection of constant definitions, with no obfuscation, dynamic execution, or unusual language features. It includes many coded identifiers but no suspicious or hidden logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large set of variable assignments for constant string values representing various codes used in financial systems (e.g., order types, status codes, system flags). There is no evidence of data processing, external input handling, or executable logic. It functions purely as a static configuration or enumeration mapping, with no malicious behavior detected. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present. It appears to be a legitimate, static resource file containing code mappings.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static set of constant definitions serving as code mappings for a trading or financial system. It shows no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The code does not process external data or execute logic that could be exploited. Overall, it is safe and appears to be a normal part of a financial application's configuration.",
