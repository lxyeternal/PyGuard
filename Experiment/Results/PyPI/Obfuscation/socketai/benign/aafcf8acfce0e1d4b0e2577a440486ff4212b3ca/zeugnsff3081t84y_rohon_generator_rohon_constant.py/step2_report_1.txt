  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly states that these are static constant mappings for system parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data input/output or dynamic data flow; purely static.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious constructs; includes many coded identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is a large collection of constant assignments serving as lookup tables. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or obfuscation detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Risk = 0.1 (low), Obfuscated = 0 — aligns well with the analysis.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing static constant definitions.\n- No dynamic or external data handling.\n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Same pattern: static enumeration constants.\n- No dynamic logic or data processing.\n- No malicious indicators.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Continues the trend: static constants for system configuration.\n- No external input or dynamic code.\n- No obfuscation or malicious patterns.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — consistent.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also static constant definitions for enumerations and status codes.\n- No data flow from untrusted sources.\n- No signs of malicious behavior.\n- Scores: Malware = 0, Risk = 0, Obfuscated = 0 — appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Critical Evaluation:\n- All reports correctly identify that the code is a static collection of constant mappings.\n- There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or hidden backdoors.\n- The risk scores are appropriately low, and malware scores are zero.\n- The confidence levels are high, reflecting that these are straightforward configuration constants.\n\n### Final Justification:\n- **Malware Score:** Should remain at 0 across all reports. No malicious activity or payloads are present.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Should be 0, as the code is transparent and straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Should stay very low (around 0.0 to 0.1), since static constants pose minimal security risk unless they contain secrets or backdoors, which they do not.\n\n### Overall Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.0 — 0.1 (negligible)\n\n**Conclusion:** The provided reports are accurate and well-justified. The code is a benign, static enumeration set used for system configuration, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
