{
  "purpose": "This code defines a large set of constant mappings used for financial trading system configurations, identifiers, statuses, and enums.",
  "sources": "The source is a series of variable assignments establishing constant mappings, typically for use throughout a larger application or system.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, input/output, or untrusted data handling occurs within this code fragment. It is purely static mappings.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as this code only sets static constants without any runtime data handling.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious code patterns are evident. The code is purely declarative with constants.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive list of constant mappings associating descriptive variable names with string identifiers, likely used for system states, types, codes, or configurations in a financial trading platform. It consists of static variable assignments with no input, output, or dynamic execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or dynamic code execution. All variables follow a consistent pattern, indicating structured, documented constants rather than malicious or hidden logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign set of constants defining mappings for a financial trading system. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It appears to be standard configuration or enumeration definitions used in larger, secure applications.",
