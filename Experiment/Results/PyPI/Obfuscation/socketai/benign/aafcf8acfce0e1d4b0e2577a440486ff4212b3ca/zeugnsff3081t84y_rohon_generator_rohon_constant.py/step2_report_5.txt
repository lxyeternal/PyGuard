  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Static constant mappings for system parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No dynamic data handling or external inputs.\n- **Anomalies:** No obfuscation or suspicious logic.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Purely static, legitimate enumeration definitions. No malicious behavior detected.\n- **Confidence & Scores:** High confidence (0.9), malware score 0, security risk 0.1. The low security risk score is reasonable given the static nature.\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly identifies the code as benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The scores seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Constant assignments, no input.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data flow or untrusted data handling.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Static configuration data, safe.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. The code is a static set of constants with no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Similar to previous reports, emphasizing static variable assignments with no executable logic.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Consistent with previous findings: static constants, no dynamic code, no external data.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 1, malware 0, security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Valid. No security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Also highlights static, well-structured constants with no dynamic behavior.\n- **Scores:** Slightly lower confidence (0.95), but still very high, with malware 0 and security risk 0.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Conclusion:\nAll reports correctly identify the code as static constant definitions for enumeration/mapping purposes in a financial system. No signs of obfuscation, malicious code, backdoors, or dynamic behavior are present. The malware scores are all zero, and security risks are minimal, reflecting the static, non-executable nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### My Final Assessment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (clear, straightforward constants)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, as it’s purely static configuration data)\n\nThis set of constants appears to be a standard, legitimate part of a financial or trading system's configuration, with no security concerns.",
