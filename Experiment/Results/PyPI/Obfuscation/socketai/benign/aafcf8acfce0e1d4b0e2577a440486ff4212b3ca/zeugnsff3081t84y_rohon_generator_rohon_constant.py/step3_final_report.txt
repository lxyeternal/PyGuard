{
  "purpose": "The code defines a comprehensive set of static constant mappings for system parameters, status codes, enumeration values, and configuration options used within a financial or trading system. These constants serve as lookup tables for various system states, types, and identifiers.",
  "sources": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments, with no input reading, external data sources, or dynamic data handling. It functions as a collection of enumeration definitions.",
  "sinks": "There are no data input or output sinks, nor any untrusted data flows. The code does not process external data or user input; it is purely declarative.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks exist, as the code is static and does not involve runtime data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No obfuscation techniques, encrypted or misleading variable names, or suspicious constructs are present. The code is straightforward, with clear constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large set of constant assignments representing enumeration values for system statuses, types, and configurations. It does not contain any executable logic, dynamic code, or data processing. The absence of obfuscation, secrets, or malicious patterns indicates it is a benign configuration resource. The scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, and the security risk is negligible, consistent with its static nature.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a benign, static collection of enumeration constants used for system configuration in a financial or trading platform. No malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are detected. The code is safe for use and does not pose any supply chain security threat.",
