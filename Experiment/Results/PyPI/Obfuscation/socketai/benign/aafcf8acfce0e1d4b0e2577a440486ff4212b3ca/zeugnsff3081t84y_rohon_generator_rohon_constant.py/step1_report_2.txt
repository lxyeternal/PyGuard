{
  "purpose": "Defines a series of constant mappings for various trading and financial system codes used within a larger trading system or SDK.",
  "sources": "The code itself is a set of constant assignments; no input or external data is read.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output operations are present that could lead to data leaks or code injection.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks; this is purely a static configuration of constants.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are evident. The code consists solely of constant definitions with no dynamic code execution or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "The entire code comprises constant variable assignments mapping descriptive identifiers to single-character string codes. These mappings serve as enumerations or lookup tables for use throughout a trading system. There are no functions, input handling, external calls, or dynamic execution. The code appears to be straightforward, static configuration data, unlikely to be malicious or intentionally harmful.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static set of constant definitions serving as enumerations or configuration mappings for a trading system. There are no signs of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is purely declarative, with no dynamic or executable components that could be exploited.",
