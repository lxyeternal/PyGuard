{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constant mappings between descriptive identifiers and their corresponding single-character string codes, likely used as enumeration values in a larger financial or trading system.",
  "sources": "The code consists of static variable assignments with no external input or data reading mechanisms.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data flows, no database queries, network transmissions, or command executions present.",
  "flows": "The code does not perform any data flow operations; it solely establishes constant mappings.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists purely of constant definitions, with no executable logic, data manipulation, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or backdoors are present. No obfuscation, misleading variable names, or signs of malicious intent are evident.",
  "analysis": "This code is a straightforward collection of constant variable assignments, serving as enumeration mappings within a larger application. It does not include functions, input/output operations, or control flow statements. The assignments are static and descriptive, mapping identifiers to single-character strings, possibly for use as codes in protocol messages or data storage. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or hidden backdoors. The absence of dynamic code execution, external data reads, or network activities indicates a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static configuration or enumeration mapping file, with no malicious intent or security risks. It simply defines constants used for code clarity and consistency across a larger system. No security concerns or malicious behaviors are detected.",
