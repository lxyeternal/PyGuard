  "purpose": "A code generator that reads C++ header files, extracts callback and request function signatures, and generates corresponding C++ source/header files and bindings.",
  "sources": "Reads header files, constructs module names from internal variables, and processes lines to identify functions and callbacks.",
  "sinks": "Writes generated code to multiple files; no external data leaks or network activity.",
  "flows": "Header file reading -> line processing -> code generation -> file writing.",
  "anomalies": "Uses importlib.import_module with module names constructed from internal variables; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a structured, purpose-driven code generator for C++ API wrappers. It performs string parsing, file I/O, and dynamic module import based on internal variables. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The dynamic import is controlled via internal variables, not user input, minimizing risk. No network activity or data exfiltration is detected. The code's operations are standard for code generation tools, and no malicious payloads are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, controlled code generator with negligible security risks. The dynamic import usage, while a potential vector if inputs are manipulated, appears to be safe given the controlled context. No malware, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is detected.",
