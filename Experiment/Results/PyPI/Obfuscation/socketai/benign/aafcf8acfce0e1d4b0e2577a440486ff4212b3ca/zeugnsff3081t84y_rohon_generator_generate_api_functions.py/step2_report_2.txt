  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the potential security implications, correctness, and consistency of the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- Purpose: A code generator that reads C++ header files, extracts callback and request function signatures, and generates corresponding C++ source/header files and bindings.\n- Key operations: Reads files, parses lines, performs string manipulations, dynamically imports modules based on internal variables, writes code snippets to multiple files.\n- No network activity, no obfuscated code, no hardcoded secrets, and no signs of malicious behavior are evident.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review of each report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the code as a code generator for C++ API wrappers, using importlib to load modules based on class variables.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Files are written based on internal data; no external data leaks or malicious data exfiltration.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Dynamic import is controlled via internal variables, not user input.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious intent detected; the code is a legitimate code generator.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.1 — reasonable given the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** The scores seem appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; focuses on reading header files and importing modules dynamically.\n- **Analysis:** The dynamic import could be a minor concern if module names are manipulated externally, but in this context, it's controlled.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, just a code generator.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — aligns with the analysis.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate scores.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar, emphasizes the potential risk of module name manipulation.\n- **Analysis:** The concern about dynamic import is noted, but no actual malicious activity is observed.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The risk score is slightly higher (0.2), which is reasonable considering the dynamic import risk.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Reiterates the same purpose, with emphasis on string processing and dynamic import.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no malicious behavior, just a code generator.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The risk score remains low.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Same as above; no new suspicious points.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity detected; the code is a standard code generator.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The risk score is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0.2 — reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code, backdoors, or malware.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All reports assign 0, which is accurate; the code is clear and structured.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above 0, mostly due to the dynamic importlib usage, which could be exploited if inputs are untrusted. However, in this context, the control seems internal and safe.\n\n### **My final estimates:**\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk:** **0.1 to 0.2** — mainly due to dynamic importlib, but overall low.\n\n**Justification:** The code is a legitimate, well-structured code generator with no malicious intent. The only minor concern is the dynamic import, which warrants cautious validation of inputs but is not inherently dangerous here.\n\n---\n\n**Final recommendations:**\n\n- Keep malware and obfuscated scores at 0.\n- Slightly increase the risk score to 0.1 or 0.2 to reflect the cautious stance on dynamic importlib, but overall, the risk remains low.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n**- Malware score:** 0  \n**- Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**- Risk score:** 0.1 (to acknowledge the dynamic import concern but not significant)  \n\nThe code appears safe and purpose-driven, with no malicious or obfuscated elements.",
