{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import modules related to an API, possibly for financial or trading applications, and some constants.",
  "sources": "Imports modules from the current package: 'vnrohonmd', 'vnrohontd', and 'rohon_constant'. These are source files within the package, likely containing classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no code execution, data handling, or external communication is present in the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are explicitly shown; the imports prepare for further code execution which is not provided.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present. The import statements are straightforward, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the same package. There is no executable logic, user input, or data handling shown. These imports likely set up classes and constants for use elsewhere. No indicators of malicious activity, such as hardcoded credentials, network activity, or obfuscated code, are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a standard import section with no apparent malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger application, but based solely on this snippet, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security issues.",
