  "purpose": "This code imports modules and constants likely related to trading APIs or similar functionality.",
  "sources": "Module imports from local files: .vnrohonmd, .vnrohontd, and .rohon_constant",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or data leaks evident",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis possible with only import statements; no execution flow shown",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are visible in these import statements",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing classes MdApi and TdApi from local modules, and constants from a constants module. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data manipulation, or suspicious code activity. As only import statements are provided, no data flow or potential malicious payloads can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be standard module import code, with no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is a typical setup for a package that uses local modules.",
