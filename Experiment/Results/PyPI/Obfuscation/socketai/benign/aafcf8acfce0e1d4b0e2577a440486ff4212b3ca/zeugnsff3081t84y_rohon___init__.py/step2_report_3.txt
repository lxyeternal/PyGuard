  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the original code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .vnrohonmd import MdApi as RohonMdApi\nfrom .vnrohontd import TdApi as RohonTdApi\nfrom .rohon_constant import *\n```\n\n---\n\n**Report 1 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** No malicious activity, straightforward imports, no anomalies.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is benign; no issues detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, with slightly less confidence (0.8). No suspicious patterns.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.2 (slightly elevated but justified due to package context).\n- **Assessment:** The low security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable given only import statements. No malware detected.\n\n**Verdict:** The scoring appears consistent with the analysis. No adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as above, very standard imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate, given the benign nature of the code snippet.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, straightforward imports, no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.\n- **Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n**Verdict:** No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5 Analysis:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same as others, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Presence of Malicious Code:** None detected in the provided snippet.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk Scores:** All are low (0 or 0.1), consistent with benign import statements.\n- **Malware Scores:** Correctly set to 0 across all reports.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 for all, as no malicious activity is evident.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0, no obfuscation present.\n- **Risk Score:** Remains low, around 0.0 to 0.1, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- The reports correctly identify that these are simple import statements with no malicious indicators.\n- To improve confidence, further review of the imported modules (`vnrohonmd`, `vnrohontd`, `rohon_constant`) would be necessary, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears safe.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The initial assessments and scores are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary.",
