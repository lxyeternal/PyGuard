  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Findings:** The code is just import statements from internal modules, with no suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** The report is accurate; no issues are present.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Findings:** Similar import statements, with slightly lower confidence, but still no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.2, Confidence = 0.8.\n- **Assessment:** The slight security risk score (0.2) seems reasonable, given the minimal code. No malware or obfuscation.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Findings:** Same pattern, straightforward imports, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with the code; no issues.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Findings:** Same as above, standard imports.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0, Confidence = 1.\n- **Assessment:** Correct.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Findings:** Same as previous, no suspicious patterns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.1, Confidence = 0.9.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly identify no malicious activity. Given the code snippet, this is accurate.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** No obfuscation detected; scores are correctly zero.\n- **Risk Score:** Slightly above zero in some reports (0.1–0.2), reflecting minimal risk associated with module imports alone, which is reasonable.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n- The code is purely import statements; no data flows, no external communication, no suspicious patterns.\n- Without further context or code, there is no basis to assign higher risk or malware scores.\n- The scores are consistent with the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (confirmed no malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (acceptable minimal risk for import statements, unless further code indicates otherwise)\n\n**Note:** If future code snippets include dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious patterns, these scores should be revisited.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** The current assessments are appropriate. No changes needed. The code appears benign and standard for a Python package setup.",
