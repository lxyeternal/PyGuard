{
  "purpose": "This code imports modules and constants from the same package, likely setting up APIs and constants for further use.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .vnrohonmd, .vnrohontd, .rohon_constant",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points; no untrusted data handling or external communication",
  "flows": "N/A, as this code only performs imports without data flow logic",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, and no unusual patterns observed in this snippet",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports specific classes and constants from local modules within the package. There are no suspicious or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code execution. The imported modules appear to be parts of an API or SDK, which is typical in package setup. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious intent are evident based solely on these import statements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward import statement typical in Python packages, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident from this snippet.",
