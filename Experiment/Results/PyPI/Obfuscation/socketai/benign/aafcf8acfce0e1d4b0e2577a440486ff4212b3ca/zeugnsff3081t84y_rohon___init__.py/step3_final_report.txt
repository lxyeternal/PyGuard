  "purpose": "Import statements for internal modules, likely related to API classes and constants for a financial or trading application.",
  "sources": "Local module files: .vnrohonmd, .vnrohontd, .rohon_constant",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of straightforward relative import statements importing classes and constants from internal modules. No data handling, external communication, or dynamic code execution is present. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of this snippet. Given the absence of suspicious activity, malware scores are set to 0, and security risk scores are very low (~0.1), reflecting minimal concern. The confidence in these assessments is high (0.8-1). No anomalies or obfuscation are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import block with no malicious or security issues. The scores are consistent with the benign nature of the code. No modifications are necessary.",
