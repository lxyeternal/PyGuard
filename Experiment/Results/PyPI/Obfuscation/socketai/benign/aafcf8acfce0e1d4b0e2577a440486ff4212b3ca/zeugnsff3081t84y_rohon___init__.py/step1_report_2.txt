  "purpose": "This code appears to be importing modules and constants related to a specific application or API, likely for financial or trading purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .vnrohonmd, .vnrohontd, and .rohon_constant.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if imported modules or constants contain malicious code or secrets, they could be exploited, but no direct sinks are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports are loaded into the current namespace; no data flow from untrusted sources is evident in this fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses relative imports which are typical in packages but does not indicate any anomalies directly. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import statements from internal modules. Without additional context or content of these modules, there is no indication of malicious behavior. The structure is typical for Python packages. No suspicious or malicious activity is apparent from this minimal code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard import statement block typical for Python packages. No signs of malware, malicious intent, or security risks are visible in this fragment. Further review of the imported modules would be necessary to confirm their safety, but based solely on this snippet, it appears benign.",
