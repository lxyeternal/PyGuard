{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and classes, likely for use in a larger application or package, related to Rohon APIs and constants.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .vnrohonmd, .vnrohontd, and .rohon_constant.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data handling, network operations, or data output present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable in this small code fragment; it only sets up imports.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code structures are evident. The code is straightforward, importing specific components.",
  "analysis": "The code simply imports classes and constants from local modules. No user input, network operations, or data leaks are evident. Without additional context, these imports appear standard for a modular Python project. There is no obfuscation, malicious code, or suspicious behavior visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this minimal code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. It appears to be standard import statements setting up access to API classes and constants.",
