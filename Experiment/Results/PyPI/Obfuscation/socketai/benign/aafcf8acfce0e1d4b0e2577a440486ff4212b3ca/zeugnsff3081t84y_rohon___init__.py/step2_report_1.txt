  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the original code snippet:\n\nOriginal Code:\n```python\nfrom .vnrohonmd import MdApi as RohonMdApi\nfrom .vnrohontd import TdApi as RohonTdApi\nfrom .rohon_constant import *\n```\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies that these are import statements from internal modules, likely for an API related to trading/financial applications.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows are present.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Accurate; the code is straightforward, with no malicious activity evident.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** The report correctly concludes there's no malicious behavior. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly notes relative imports from internal modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks or flows visible.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies, secrets, or suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states the code appears benign.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 (slightly higher, but still low; perhaps considering the potential for malicious modules, but no evidence here)\n\n**Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The slightly elevated security risk score could be justified if the imported modules were suspicious, but with only import statements, this remains low. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the import of local modules.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data handling or external communication.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Finds no signs of malicious behavior.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Consistent and accurate. No changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly describes the imports.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data sinks.\n- **Anomalies:** No anomalies.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes this is standard import code.\n- **Confidence:** 1\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0\n\n**Assessment:** Correct assessment; no issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Correctly identifies the modules being imported.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious patterns.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately states this is typical module import code.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Security Risk:** 0.1\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate and consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports agree that the code is just import statements with no malicious activity.\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious code.\n- The security risk scores are low, reflecting the minimal risk based on this snippet.\n\n### Final Expert Judgment:\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious activity)\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk Score:** 0.1 (very low, standard import code)\n\n**Rationale:** The code is straightforward, with no signs of malware, obfuscation, or security issues. The only potential concern would be the imported modules themselves, but without inspecting their content, there's no basis for suspicion.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and reasonable. No adjustments are necessary. The overall assessment indicates this code snippet is benign and typical for a Python package setup.",
