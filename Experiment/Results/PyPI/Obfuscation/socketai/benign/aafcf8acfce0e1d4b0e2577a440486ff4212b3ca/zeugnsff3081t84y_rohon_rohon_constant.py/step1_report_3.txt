{
  "purpose": "This code defines a comprehensive set of constant mappings for a financial trading system, including enumerations for account types, transaction types, order statuses, and other domain-specific codes.",
  "sources": "The code consists solely of constant variable definitions with hardcoded string values, primarily in the form of variable assignments.",
  "sinks": "There are no functions, input/output operations, or data processing that could lead to data leaks or security vulnerabilities. No external data sources or sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists as the code is purely static constant definitions without dynamic execution or data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists exclusively of static variable assignments with descriptive naming conventions. No suspicious patterns, obfuscated code, or malicious logic are present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is a large collection of constant mappings, typical for enumeration purposes within a financial trading platform. It does not include executable logic, user input, network communication, or cryptographic operations. All values are static string literals representing domain-specific codes, which are unlikely to be malicious. The structure and content indicate standard enumeration definitions, and no anomalies such as code injection, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior are detectable. The code's primary function appears to be providing readable symbolic constants for various trading system statuses, types, and codes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward set of constant definitions for a trading system. It contains no malicious behavior, no suspicious patterns, and no security risks. It is purely declarative and used for system coding standards. Overall, it poses no security threat.",
