{
  "purpose": "This code defines a large set of constant mappings for various codes used within a financial trading system, likely for encoding and decoding protocol messages or data fields.",
  "sources": "The code consists solely of static constant definitions, with no input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "There are no sink points where untrusted data is processed or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks exists; the code does not process input data but only assigns constant mappings.",
  "anomalies": "The code is a comprehensive list of hardcoded string constants with no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious constructs. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are apparent. The constants are domain-specific and typical for protocol encoding.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely declarative, defining constants that map descriptive identifiers to short code values, which are likely used for protocol or data representation purposes. There are no inputs, no dynamic execution, and no signs of malicious behavior. The format is consistent with typical configuration or enumeration definitions, with no obfuscation or unusual language features. It appears to be a static resource used for encoding/decoding within a trading system. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. No security risks are evident from the static constants.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static mapping of constants for protocol or data field encoding, with no malicious behavior or security risks. It is a typical configuration resource and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
