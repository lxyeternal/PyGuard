  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the provided code step-by-step:\n\n1. **Code Nature & Content**:  \n   The code consists solely of static constant definitions mapping descriptive identifiers to short string codes. There are no functions, data processing, input/output operations, or dynamic code execution. The constants are domain-specific, typical for encoding/decoding protocol messages or data fields in a financial trading system.\n\n2. **Potential Security Concerns**:  \n   - No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or backdoors are present.\n   - No obfuscation, malicious logic, or dynamic code constructs.\n   - The constants are used for enumeration, configuration, or protocol encoding, which is standard practice.\n   - No data flows from untrusted sources, no input processing, and no external communication within this snippet.\n\n3. **Malware & Obfuscation**:  \n   All reports correctly identify that the code is straightforward, static, and non-obfuscated. No signs of malware, malicious payloads, or obfuscation are detected.\n\n4. **Security Risks & Anomalies**:  \n   The only minor concern noted is the volume of hardcoded constants, but this is typical for such configuration files and does not constitute a security risk.\n\n5. **Scores Justification**:  \n   - Malware score: consistently 0 or 0.1, which is appropriate given the static, benign nature.\n   - Obfuscated: 0, aligns with the absence of obfuscation.\n   - Risk score: very low, reflecting no evident security threat.\n\n6. **Overall Assessment**:  \n   All reports agree that this is a benign, static enumeration/constants file with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendation:\n\n**Based on the detailed review:**\n\n- The code is purely declarative, with no dynamic or malicious elements.\n- The constant mappings are domain-specific and typical for a trading system.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or security risks are present.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n- The malware score should remain at **0.0**.\n- The obfuscated score should stay at **0.0**.\n- The overall security risk score should be **very close to 0**, perhaps **0.0 or 0.1** at most, considering the minor concern about volume but not actual security risk.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Metric             | Suggested Score |\n|--------------------|-----------------|\n| Malware            | 0.0             |\n| Obfuscated         | 0.0             |\n| Security Risk      | 0.0             |\n\nThis code appears to be a standard, safe configuration resource with no supply chain threat.",
