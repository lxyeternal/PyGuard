{
  "purpose": "This code defines a series of constant mappings associating descriptive identifiers with single-character string codes, likely used for encoding various status, type, or configuration parameters within a larger financial or trading system.",
  "sources": "The code sources are hardcoded string assignments, mapping identifiers to specific string literals, with no external input or data reading involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process or output untrusted data, nor does it perform any I/O operations or network communications.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows, as this code solely assigns constant values; no dynamic data or source-to-sink paths are present.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive hardcoded constants, which could be a concern if secrets or sensitive information were embedded. However, these appear to be static configuration mappings or enums for system states and types, not secrets. There are no signs of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "A thorough examination shows this code is a collection of static constant definitions, likely used as enumerations or code mappings for a trading or financial system. No external input, network activity, or sensitive data handling is evident. The constants are systematically assigned, and there is no indication of malicious payloads or backdoors. The only potential concern is the volume of hardcoded values, but they are typical for system configuration and not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a large set of static constant mappings for system parameters, enums, or status codes. It does not exhibit any malicious behavior or suspicious activity. Its purpose appears to be providing predefined codes for use elsewhere in a secure, controlled manner.",
