  "purpose": "The code functions as a setup script for a Python package that includes C++ extension modules, managing framework paths, copying necessary files, and configuring build parameters for different platforms.",
  "sources": "Filesystem operations (os.path.exists, os.makedirs, shutil.copytree), environment variables (os.environ['HOME']), and source code files for extension modules.",
  "sinks": "Filesystem modifications (creating directories, copying files), environment variable reads, and extension module configuration.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and filesystem checks influence directory creation and copying; source files are used to build extension modules with platform-specific compile and link flags.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no obfuscation, network activity, or hidden backdoors; environment variables are used in a standard manner.",
  "analysis": "The script performs typical setup tasks: verifying Python version, managing user directories via environment variables, copying framework files, and configuring C++ extension modules with platform-specific flags. No malicious code, obfuscation, or malicious data flow is present. Filesystem and environment variable usage are standard for build scripts. The code is straightforward and well-structured, with no signs of sabotage or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate setup script for a Python extension package involving C++ modules. It performs standard operations without any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The low malware score (0) and risk score (~0.2) are justified given the context.",
