{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python package component, likely intended for data processing or utility functions. No explicit purpose is clearly stated.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, file reads, and potentially user inputs via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file writes, or database operations, though none are explicitly visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from inputs (environment variables, files, function arguments) through processing functions to outputs or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no suspicious dynamic execution, and no hidden behaviors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with standard function definitions and data handling procedures. It uses common libraries without suspicious patterns. No signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, system modification, or hidden network connections. The lack of complex or unusual constructs suggests no malicious intent. The code appears to be well-structured, with no anomalies indicating sabotage or malware. The overall security posture is benign based on this review.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to serve a typical utility or processing purpose with no evident supply chain threats.",
