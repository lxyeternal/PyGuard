  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input variables, possibly environment variables, or files if present. Specific input sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include output functions such as print statements, file write operations, network requests, or subprocess calls. The exact sinks are not explicitly shown in the snippet provided.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions, potentially leading to output or external communication points. Due to the absence of explicit I/O operations in the snippet, the exact flow cannot be fully determined.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL connections, or obfuscated code are evident. The code does not contain unusual language features or malicious constructs in the visible parts.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited due to the absence of the actual code snippet. Based on the structure, there are no immediate signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data theft, or backdoors. The code appears to be straightforward with standard Python syntax. Without specific details or context, no anomalies or malicious indicators can be confidently identified.",
  "conclusion": "There are no evident signs of malicious intent or security risks in the provided code fragment. The code seems benign, but the lack of context limits a thorough assessment. No malicious behavior or obfuscation detected.",
