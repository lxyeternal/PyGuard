  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic control flow typical of potentially malicious scripts. While definitive malicious activity cannot be confirmed without inspecting the imported function, the pattern warrants high suspicion. The malware score should be set around 0.75, obfuscation remains high (~0.9), and overall security risk is elevated (~0.75). Further investigation into the imported module is strongly advised."
