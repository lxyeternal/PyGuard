  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'zv3to6akeu5gk6ih', including package metadata and entry points.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools, sys module, and package metadata definitions within setup()",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or potential data leaks identified",
  "flows": "Imports are static; setup() configuration is static data assignment, no dynamic data flows detected",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. Package name appears obfuscated but benign in structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script defining package metadata and entry points. No input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no external data sources are utilized during runtime. The package name is obfuscated but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious code patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package with obfuscated package name. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks within this code fragment.",
