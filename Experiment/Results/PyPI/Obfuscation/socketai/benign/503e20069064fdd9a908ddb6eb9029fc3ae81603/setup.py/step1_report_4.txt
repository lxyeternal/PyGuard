  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named 'zv3to6akeu5gk6ih' including entry points and testing requirements.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and io, reading system version info from sys.",
  "sinks": "No clear sink points; no data leaks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; setup parameters are static.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name that appears randomized or obfuscated; no obvious malicious code, but the name is suspicious. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations for a Python package, including defining package data, entry points, and classifiers. It imports necessary modules, specifies package details, and conditionally includes testing dependencies based on Python version. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or other suspicious activity is present. The package name looks unusual but that alone is not malicious; it could be obfuscated or randomly generated. The code adheres to typical Python packaging practices with no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python setup script with no clear indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The unusual package name warrants further investigation outside this snippet, but within this code, no malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
