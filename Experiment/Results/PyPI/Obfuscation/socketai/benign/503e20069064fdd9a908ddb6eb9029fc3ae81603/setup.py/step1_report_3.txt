{
  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package named 'zv3to6akeu5gk6ih', including entry points and testing requirements.",
  "sources": "Imports from setuptools and io modules, sys.version_info check, package metadata definitions.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or code execution points are present.",
  "flows": "No malicious data flow from sources to sinks; the script primarily defines package metadata and configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual package name; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; no dynamic code execution or obfuscated code. The code structure appears standard for a setup script.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules for package setup, defines package metadata, entry points, and conditional test requirements based on Python version. There are no suspicious code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, nor external data processing. The package name is unconventional but not inherently malicious. The script functions solely to configure package installation parameters.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard Python setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual package name does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign.",
