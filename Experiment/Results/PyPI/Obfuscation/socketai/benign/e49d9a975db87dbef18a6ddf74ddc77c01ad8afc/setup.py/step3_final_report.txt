  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for packaging a module named DataNormalizer, importing dependencies and metadata, with obfuscated variable and function names.",
  "sources": "Reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt', reads 'README.md' content, imports 'DataNormalizer' module attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or code execution points detected.",
  "flows": "Dependency list and README content flow from files into setup parameters; module attributes flow into setup metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, which are unusual and suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious code, network activity, or credential handling is present. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports reflect the obfuscation but correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware risk. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscation high (~0.7), and overall risk low (~0.15).",
