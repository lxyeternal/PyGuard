  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package named DataNormalizer, including dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' file for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description, and importing the DataNormalizer module.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data is used in security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Reads dependencies from file -> Reads README.md content -> Uses DataNormalizer module attributes for setup.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that seem obfuscated or randomly generated, such as IHrtLXzrcdTeROvjLnciWjeTuLCdWIdc and kNmHceUJPgceSKhGBXBBAeZhYHrehUEO, which do not follow standard naming conventions. The function name XJvxczrBKCAmfbQprisEypJZmKumzPQP is also obfuscated. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is evident. The code relies on normal Python packaging procedures, and no suspicious network activity or backdoors are visible.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard modules and a local module DataNormalizer. It reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' with an unusual variable name, then reads 'README.md' content via an obfuscated function. The setup() call uses attributes from DataNormalizer and the read README. No suspicious or malicious code such as network activity, credential handling, or backdoors is present. The obfuscated variable and function names are suspicious but could be an attempt at obfuscation or placeholder code, not necessarily malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable and function names, which could be suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent by themselves. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in this code segment. Overall, the code is safe but warrants attention to the obfuscation style.",
