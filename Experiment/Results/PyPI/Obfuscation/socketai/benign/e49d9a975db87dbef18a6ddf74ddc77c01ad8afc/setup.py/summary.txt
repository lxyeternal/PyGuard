  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware risk. The current scores are appropriate; malware score should be 0, obfuscation high (~0.7), and overall risk low (~0.15)."
