  "purpose": "Setup script for the DataNormalizer Python package, configuring metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'requirements.txt' for dependencies, reading 'README.md' for long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system state or leaks occur; no network or system commands executed.",
  "flows": "Data read from 'requirements.txt' flows into dependency list; 'README.md' content flows into package description.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, which is unusual but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' for package setup, imports 'DataNormalizer' module, reads dependencies from 'requirements.txt' with highly obfuscated variable names, reads 'README.md' content for description, and calls 'setuptools.setup' with package metadata. No network operations, no system modifications, no suspicious code paths or obfuscated logic that suggest malicious intent. The obfuscated variable names may indicate an attempt to conceal code intent, but they do not perform malicious actions. No code injection, no use of environment variables, no data exfiltration, or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a typical setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names that do not perform any malicious activity. No security risks or malware indicators are detected.",
