{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a package related to normalizing data for a platform, providing metadata such as version, name, contact email, and license.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing modules from the same package directory: .normalise and .validate",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data or sensitive information leakage; no functions or operations processing external input are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; imports are static and do not process untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "The imported modules have obfuscated or non-descriptive names (AcbMHRJFjGRvUZbpeAOcxPNcWnBqBtkv, mmxlygiasvjgDmmKNobmVgoxmnLPoxJO), which is unusual but not malicious. No runtime code execution, hardcoded secrets beyond metadata, or obfuscated logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules with non-descriptive, obfuscated names, which could suggest an attempt to hide functionality. However, these are only imports, and no actual malicious code, data processing, or network activity is present. Metadata variables store version, project name, contact email, and license type, which are standard for Python packages. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The overall structure is straightforward and typical for a setup or metadata module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple metadata and import setup for a Python package. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security threats are evident. The obfuscated import names are suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent based on the provided snippet.",
