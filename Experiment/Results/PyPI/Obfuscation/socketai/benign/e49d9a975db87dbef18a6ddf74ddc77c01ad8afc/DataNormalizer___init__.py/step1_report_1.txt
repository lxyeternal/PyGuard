{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up imports and metadata for a Python package focused on normalizing data for a platform.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.normalise, .validate), and assignment of package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks, such as network operations, file writes, or data leaks, are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is evident. Imports are from local modules, and variable assignments are static.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names (e.g., AcbMHRJFjGRvUZbpeAOcxPNcWnBqBtkv, mmxlygiasvjgDmmKNobmVgoxmnLPoxJO) are highly obfuscated and do not follow conventional naming patterns, which could be suspicious. No other suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports modules that are likely part of the package, and defines metadata such as version, project name, contact email, and license. The obfuscated variable names may indicate an attempt to hide intent, but no malicious code or behavior is present in the visible fragment. The code does not perform any network activity, file operations, or data processing that could be malicious. The metadata suggests a legitimate package purpose related to data normalization.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but not necessarily malicious. Overall security risk is low, with no immediate threats identified.",
