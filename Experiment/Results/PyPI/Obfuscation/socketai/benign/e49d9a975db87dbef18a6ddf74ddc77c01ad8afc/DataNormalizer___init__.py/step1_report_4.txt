    "Import statements importing classes or functions from local modules (.normalise, .validate)",

    "Presence of heavily obfuscated or non-descriptive variable names such as AcbMHRJFjGRvUZbpeAOcxPNcWnBqBtkv and mmxlygiasvjgDmmKNobmVgoxmnLPoxJO",
    "No visible code executing untrusted input or performing network, file, or system actions",
    "No hardcoded credentials or secrets are evident",
    "All strings are either metadata (version, author, license) or import statements",
    "No signs of dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious payloads"
  ],
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of import statements and metadata variable assignments. The import statements import symbols from local modules, which is standard. The variable names are obfuscated, but they only contain strings related to version, package name, contact email, and license. There are no evident data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. No suspicious code patterns, network activity, or malicious behavior is detectable. The obfuscated variable names might be for internal code obfuscation or just naming style, but do not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign and is typical of a Python package's __init__.py or metadata setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It only performs import statements and stores metadata. The obfuscated variable names are not inherently suspicious without additional context. The package appears safe.",
