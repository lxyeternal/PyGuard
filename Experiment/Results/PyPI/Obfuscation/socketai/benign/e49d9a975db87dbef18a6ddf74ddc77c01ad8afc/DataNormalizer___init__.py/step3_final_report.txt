  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and module names, but no malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements and static metadata assignments with obfuscated names. No network, file, or runtime malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation may be for internal purposes but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity and assign low malware and risk scores. The obfuscation score is high due to variable naming but justified. No evidence of data leaks, code injection, or malicious payloads is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior. Scores should reflect a malware score of 0, a high obfuscation score (~0.7), and a low security risk (~0.2). No further action is necessary based on this snippet.",
