{
  "purpose": "This package appears to assist with normalizing data for a platform, as indicated by the docstring.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules '.normalise' and '.validate', as well as string assignments for package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules (which are not shown) and string assignments, but no dangerous or untrusted data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The imported modules have obfuscated names, which could be suspicious, but without further code or context, this alone is not definitive. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are detected. The metadata strings are typical for package info.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two modules with seemingly random or obfuscated names, which might indicate an attempt to conceal functionality. However, there are no visible malicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. The metadata strings indicate version, name, contact email, and license, typical for a Python package. No suspicious or anomalous operations are apparent within the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited content, the code appears to be a benign package setup with obfuscated import names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
