  "purpose": "Configuration management, model validation, and message formatting for a language model API client.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, function parameters, static URLs, model name lists.",
  "sinks": "Fetching environment variables, validating model names, formatting message dictionaries.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and environment variables flow into configuration functions, which produce validated configuration data used elsewhere.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, static URLs, and placeholder strings; no malicious code or network activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily handles configuration retrieval, model validation, and message formatting. Variable names are obfuscated but not suspicious; no network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic are present. The environment variables are used for configuration, and validation functions prevent unsupported models. No secrets or backdoors are detected. The obfuscation appears to be for code organization rather than malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated between 0.3 and 0.7, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration and utility module for managing API keys, model selection, and message formatting. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely superficial and not malicious. Overall, the code is safe and benign.",
