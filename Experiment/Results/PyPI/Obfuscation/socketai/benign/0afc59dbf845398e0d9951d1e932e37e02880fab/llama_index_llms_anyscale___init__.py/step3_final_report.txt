  "purpose": "Static import of an obfuscated class from a legitimate package, with an export declaration.",
  "sources": "Import statement from 'llama_index.llms.anyscale.base' module.",
  "sinks": "No runtime sinks; only static import and export declaration.",
  "flows": "Import of obfuscated class potentially leading to its use elsewhere; no direct data flow in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class name 'LiRPlHrHqtJKpEXRWVmBgIitBbGXkPVF', which appears auto-generated or intentionally obscured.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a minimal static import of a symbol with an obfuscated name, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The import path appears legitimate, and the code does not execute any logic or network activity. The main concern is the obfuscated class name, which could be used to hide malicious code or backdoors within the imported module. The reports correctly identify the obfuscation and assign high obfuscation scores (~0.8), while malware suspicion remains low (~0.2), consistent with the absence of active malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal but warrants further review of the imported module's implementation to confirm its safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in structure but contains an obfuscated class name that warrants further inspection of the imported module. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation raises suspicion. The scores assigned are appropriate; the malware score remains low unless additional evidence emerges. Further analysis of the imported class's content is recommended to rule out malicious intent.",
