{
  "purpose": "This script sets up a Python package for distribution, including reading a README file and checking Python version compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads the 'README.md' file from the current directory, and accesses system version info via sys.version_info.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "Reads external file content into a variable; verifies Python version and exits if requirements are not met.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The version check is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, reads a README file, checks Python version, and calls setup() for package distribution. Variable names appear obfuscated but serve straightforward purposes. No code injection, data leakage, or malicious behavior is detected. The version check enforces minimum Python version. The setup() function call is standard for package distribution, with no suspicious modifications or hidden code.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate package setup script with obfuscated variable names. It performs standard operations for package distribution and environment verification without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
