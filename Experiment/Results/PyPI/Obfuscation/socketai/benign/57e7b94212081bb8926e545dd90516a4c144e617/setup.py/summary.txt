  "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names and a flawed version check. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security compromise. The obfuscation and logical bug are not security issues but may affect maintainability. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero."
