      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with obfuscated variable names and a flawed version check. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security compromise. The obfuscation and logical bug are not security issues but may affect maintainability. The overall security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a complex testing or demonstration framework for class and data structure behaviors. No malicious activity, supply chain attack, or security risk is evident. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.3), and overall security risk is low (~0.2)."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "Most code is deemed safe with low malware and obfuscation scores. Suspicious patterns, especially in reports involving environment variables and network activity, warrant slightly higher malware and risk scores. The current evaluations are reasonable; minor adjustments improve risk reflection without overestimating threat levels."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign import statement with obfuscated identifiers, possibly for concealment or code compression. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet. The high obfuscation warrants further review of the '.core' module, but based solely on this code, the scores and assessment are justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated proxy and null object pattern implementations intended for safe data handling. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not in itself imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears benign with a low security risk."
