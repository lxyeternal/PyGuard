  "conclusion": "Most code is deemed safe with low malware and obfuscation scores. Suspicious patterns, especially in reports involving environment variables and network activity, warrant slightly higher malware and risk scores. The current evaluations are reasonable; minor adjustments improve risk reflection without overestimating threat levels."
