  "purpose": "Obfuscated string likely containing version or data; no clear functional purpose.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string assignment at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks detected; no data flows or output statements.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated string; code appears intentionally scrambled or incomplete; no clear logic or functions present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single line assigning an obfuscated string to a variable. The string appears to be base64 or similarly encoded data, but without decoding or further context, its purpose is unclear. No additional code, functions, or operations are provided. The obfuscated string could be benign, such as a version indicator, or malicious if used elsewhere, but this cannot be determined from the snippet alone. The code structure suggests intentional concealment of purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is minimal and obfuscated, raising suspicion but lacking concrete malicious activity evidence within this fragment. The code’s intent cannot be fully determined, but there is potential for obfuscation to hide malicious intent. Without further context, the risk remains uncertain.",
