      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package setup script employing obfuscation techniques that could hide malicious or sensitive data. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The low malware score and moderate risk score are appropriate, but further investigation of the __pkginfo__ module is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious content."

      "conclusion": "The code fragment is benign, representing an obfuscated data string—possibly version info or configuration—without any active malicious behavior. The suspicion is solely due to obfuscation, which is common in benign scenarios. No evidence suggests malicious activity, and the overall security risk is minimal."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign environment validation script with heavy obfuscation and some incomplete references. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the security risk remains low. It should be considered safe, with a recommendation for cleanup or clarification due to broken variables."
