{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up a Python package using setuptools, defining package metadata and modules.",
  "sources": "Imports from distutils and setuptools; reading from __pkginfo__ module",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data being executed or transmitted",
  "flows": "Data flows from __pkginfo__ import to setup() parameters",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or nonsensical variable names such as MOEwyUHQwEWWspVGbKLOkTFWMCAaoGUu and MqZAVIRiegsnvwmFpvOJxVGnoTLVUqZa, which could indicate obfuscation or hiding malicious intent",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard package setup but imports metadata from __pkginfo__, which uses obscured variable names. This obfuscation raises suspicion about hidden or malicious content. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or data handling beyond package setup. The unusual variable names suggest an attempt to hide the true purpose or contents, which is common in malicious code. However, no explicit malicious actions are evident within this snippet itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, possibly to hide malicious intent. Without access to __pkginfo__ contents, the risk remains uncertain. The structure itself is typical, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
