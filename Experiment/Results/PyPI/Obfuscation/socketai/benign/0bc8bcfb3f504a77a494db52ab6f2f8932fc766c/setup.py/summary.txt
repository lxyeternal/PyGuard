  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package setup script employing obfuscation techniques that could hide malicious or sensitive data. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity in this snippet. The low malware score and moderate risk score are appropriate, but further investigation of the __pkginfo__ module is recommended to ensure it does not contain malicious content."
