  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in its structure, performing configuration validation and attribute loading. The primary security concern is the behavior of 'attribute_loader.load' and the trustworthiness of input data. No direct evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. Scores are appropriately low for malware (0.2), high for obfuscation (0.7), and moderate for risk (0.4). Vigilance is advised to review the external loader's implementation to ensure safety."
