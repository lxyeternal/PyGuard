  "purpose": "Initialize and configure system components based on input data, resolving dependencies dynamically.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'jPgjGLeoCBJLEcOfayAjManTYpENYGsx' used in resolver functions and external imports.",
  "sinks": "Dependency resolution and class instantiation influenced by untrusted input; dynamic import based on runtime conditions.",
  "flows": "Input data influences resolver functions, which determine class imports and configuration objects.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive variable and function names; dynamic import based on input; lack of documentation; reliance on external resolver functions.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily obfuscated, using non-semantic names, and performs dependency resolution influenced by an external input parameter. It employs dynamic import based on resolver outputs, which could be exploited if resolver functions or inputs are malicious. No direct malicious actions such as network activity or system modification are evident. The obfuscation and dynamic import patterns are suspicious but not definitive of malicious intent. The code's structure could facilitate malicious behavior if resolver functions are compromised or maliciously crafted. The high obfuscation score (around 0.8) reflects the naming pattern, while the malware score remains low (around 0.1-0.2) due to lack of direct malicious activity. The security risk score is moderate (~0.4-0.5), considering the potential for misuse if inputs or resolver functions are malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and relies on dynamic dependency resolution, which raises suspicion but does not show explicit malicious behavior. It warrants cautious review, especially of resolver functions and imported modules, to ensure integrity. The current scores reflect high obfuscation, low likelihood of malware, and moderate risk due to potential exploitation avenues.",
