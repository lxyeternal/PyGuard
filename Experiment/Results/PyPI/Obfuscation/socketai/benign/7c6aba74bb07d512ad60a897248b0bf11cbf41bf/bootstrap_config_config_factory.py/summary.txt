  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and relies on dynamic dependency resolution, which raises suspicion but does not show explicit malicious behavior. It warrants cautious review, especially of resolver functions and imported modules, to ensure integrity. The current scores reflect high obfuscation, low likelihood of malware, and moderate risk due to potential exploitation avenues."
