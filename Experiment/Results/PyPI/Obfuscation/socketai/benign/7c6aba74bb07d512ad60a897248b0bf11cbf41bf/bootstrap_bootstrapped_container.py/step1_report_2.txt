  "purpose": "Read configuration data and retrieve environment-specific settings",
  "sources": "config_reader.read() which reads configuration data, likely from a file or environment",
  "sinks": "eYEWLkoPYaxHNKowvEjcFXuUVNzjHjWQ.VKqCHNRMFiMAabZpEHLsbdpZibCawMLp() which uses configuration data with app_env",
  "flows": "config_reader.read() -> VKqCHNRMFiMAabZpEHLsbdpZibCawMLp() with app_env and config data",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and function names; no explicit secrets or hardcoded credentials found; reliance on external library function",
  "analysis": "The code imports a configuration reader, reads configuration data, then calls a method on the configuration object passing in an environment string. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which may hinder understanding but does not indicate malicious intent. The process appears to be standard configuration handling. No evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors is present. The obfuscation may be suspicious but could also be a coding style choice. No network activity, file manipulation, or sensitive data handling is visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard configuration retrieval and environment-specific configuration access. There are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but not inherently malicious. Overall, this seems to be benign code with no immediate security concerns.",
