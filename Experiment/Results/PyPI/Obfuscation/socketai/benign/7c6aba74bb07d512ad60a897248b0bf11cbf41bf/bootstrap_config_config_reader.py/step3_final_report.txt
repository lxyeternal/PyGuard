  "purpose": "Load configuration data from raw input and process it into a configuration object using obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "pyproject.ZKOFQotQwZvdtrtxcPFvmVmxXFpbSfhS() as input source for raw_config_reader.read()",
  "sinks": "config_factory.ffimLJILpXbtYFUGrQerARzwwzzKEKor() as the output sink of processed configuration data",
  "flows": "Data flows from the raw_config_reader.read() input, through the variable, into the config_factory method, and returns the configuration object",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, dynamic references, and indirect data flow suggest concealment but no explicit malicious activity",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration loading with heavily obfuscated identifiers, which could be for proprietary or concealment purposes. No evidence of malicious activities such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection is present. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The malware score is low (0.0-0.2), and the security risk is also low (0.2-0.3), consistent with a benign configuration loader that warrants further review if additional context is available.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical configuration loader with obfuscated identifiers, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. No direct evidence of malware or malicious behavior is detected. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review, but overall, the security risk remains low.",
