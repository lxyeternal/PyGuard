  "purpose": "Unit test for configuration loading and dependency injection verification.",
  "sources": "Configuration file path resolved via resolve_path, class ihIspvZHSHSJiyoseeyDSvOUjzJYCnyK, and get() methods retrieving class instances.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external effects; object instantiations and assertions only.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from resolve_path to kernel object, then to get() calls retrieving class instances.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name 'ihIspvZHSHSJiyoseeyDSvOUjzJYCnyK' and non-descriptive variable/method names; no direct malicious activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward unit test that loads configuration and retrieves class instances. The obfuscated class name and variable names are suspicious but do not indicate malicious behavior. No code injection, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The obfuscation may be proprietary or internal. Scores of malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.75 are consistent with the benign analysis. The code's purpose is standard dependency injection testing, with obfuscation as the primary concern but not evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign unit test with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity is detected. Obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not inherently imply malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the analysis.",
