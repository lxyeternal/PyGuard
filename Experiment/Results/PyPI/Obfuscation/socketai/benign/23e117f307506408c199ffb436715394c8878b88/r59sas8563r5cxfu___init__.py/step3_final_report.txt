  "purpose": "Chinese text conversion (simplified/traditional), uses language model data.",
  "sources": "Loads resource files ('traditional.txt', 'simplified.txt', 'bigram.json', 'monogram.json') via importlib.resources.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; processes data locally.",
  "flows": "Loads data, processes text with functions based on frequency data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a language processing utility, loading resource files for character mappings and frequency counters, then performing translation and probabilistic character prediction. No network activity, external communication, or malicious code patterns are present. Obfuscation of variable names is notable but not indicative of malicious intent; it may be for code concealment or obfuscation. The logic is standard for language modeling and text conversion, with no signs of sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Chinese text conversion utility leveraging language model data. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior is detected. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The overall security risk is low. The assigned malware score is 0, obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), and security risk score is low (~0.2).",
