      "conclusion": "The code is benign, comprising only import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation warrants attention but does not imply malicious intent based solely on this snippet. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated statistical utility with no evidence of malicious intent. The high obfuscation warrants caution, and external dependencies should be verified for integrity. Overall, the security risk is low, but the obfuscation and incomplete code suggest reviewing external modules and possibly refactoring for clarity."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated implementation of KDE functions with thread management, showing no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or proprietary reasons, not malicious sabotage. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), consistent with the analysis."
