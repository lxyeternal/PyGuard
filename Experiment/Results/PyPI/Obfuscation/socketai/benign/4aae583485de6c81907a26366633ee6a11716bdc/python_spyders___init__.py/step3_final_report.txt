{
  "purpose": "The code imports obfuscated symbols from internal modules, likely for internal use or as part of a larger package. No malicious behavior or external interactions are evident.",
  "sources": "Import statements reading symbols from local modules (.epanechnikov and .mbe).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present; the code only performs static imports.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow or execution beyond import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated or autogenerated symbol names, which could suggest concealment or code auto-generation.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated symbol names, indicating potential code concealment but no active malicious behavior. The high obfuscation scores reflect the naming pattern, but without further code, there is no evidence of malicious activity. Malware score is 0, risk score is low (~0.1-0.2), and obfuscation score is high (~0.7). The reasoning across reports is consistent and appropriate given the limited context.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, comprising only import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The high obfuscation warrants attention but does not imply malicious intent based solely on this snippet. Scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
