  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from internal modules within the package",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: .epanechnikov and .mbe",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling or external output in this fragment",
  "flows": "Importing module components; no data flow from untrusted sources or to sinks",
  "anomalies": "Unusually named identifiers (e.g., MTuAyxmobqoXpucNXSpwwqcbUONiNbtb) and lack of descriptive names; no documentation or comments; potential obfuscation or placeholder names",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules with obfuscated or nonsensical names. No input sources, data processing, or output sinks are present. The identifiers are unusually long and nonspecific, which could indicate obfuscation or autogenerated code, but no malicious behavior is directly evident. No external data or sensitive information is accessed or transferred in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be a simple set of import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data leakage, or security risks based solely on this snippet. The unusual naming warrants caution, but no malicious intent can be confirmed.",
