  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes or functions from local modules, likely for use elsewhere in the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .epanechnikov and .mbe",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or cause data leaks are present",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; the code only imports symbols",
  "anomalies": "The imported names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could suggest intentional concealment. No actual malicious activity detected in this snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from internal modules, with obfuscated symbol names. No external input, no data processing, no suspicious network activity, and no sensitive data handling. The obfuscated naming might be for code concealment but does not by itself indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard import statement with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
