  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules for use within the package.",

  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data being sent, written, or used insecurely in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imported components are used elsewhere in the package; no data flow shown here.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions for imported identifiers, which appear to be obfuscated or randomly generated. No explicit code execution or data handling shown.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements importing functions or classes with non-descriptive, seemingly random names from local modules. There is no direct execution, data handling, or network activity in this snippet. The naming suggests obfuscation, but without further context, it does not indicate malicious behavior. The code is minimal, and no suspicious actions are apparent from these imports alone.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be simple import statements with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. The obfuscation could be a concern if part of a larger suspicious pattern, but based solely on this, it seems benign.",
