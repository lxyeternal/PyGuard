{
  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from internal modules within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from relative modules: .epanechnikov and .mbe.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data handling or potential data leak points.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions for imported symbols (e.g., MTuAyxmobqoXpucNXSpwwqcbUONiNbtb), which appear obfuscated or autogenerated. No usage of environment variables, network calls, or other suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import operations from internal modules with non-descriptive, possibly obfuscated names. No functions, data handling, or malicious activities are present. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected. The unusual naming may be a result of code obfuscation or auto-generation, but without further code, no malicious intent can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "This code is limited to importing symbols with obfuscated names from internal modules. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks based solely on these import statements.",
