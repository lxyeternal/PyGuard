  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules 'epanechnikov' and 'mbe' within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: '.epanechnikov' and '.mbe'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data leaks present in import statements; potential risk if these modules are malicious internally",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules or symbols into namespace, but do not execute code or data flow beyond symbol import",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; import statements are standard. The imported identifiers appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which may be suspicious but could also be just obfuscated naming.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from local modules, importing seemingly randomly named symbols. There are no function calls, data processing, or network operations. The use of obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers might suggest malicious intent or simply obfuscation. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The code appears to be merely importing symbols from internal modules. The suspicious element is the obfuscated symbol names, which could be a sign of concealment, but do not by themselves indicate malicious intent.",
