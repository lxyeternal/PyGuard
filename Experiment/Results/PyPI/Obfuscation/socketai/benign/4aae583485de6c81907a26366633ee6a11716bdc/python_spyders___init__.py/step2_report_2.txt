  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the provided information with the original code, and evaluate the reasoning, scores, and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Original Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .epanechnikov import MTuAyxmobqoXpucNXSpwwqcbUONiNbtb, nJpslSHYyihclpVRdeAbjsYPlgAIUpVU\nfrom .mbe import mcKgMTNXePXbBoaGUpqriQLZfjFGgPQY\n```\n\n---\n\n### General Observations:\n- The code only performs import statements from internal modules.\n- The imported symbols have highly obfuscated or autogenerated names.\n- No functions, data processing, network calls, or data leaks are present.\n- The reports uniformly suggest obfuscation but no malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Review of Each Report:\n\n#### **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import specific symbols.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly notes only import statements, no suspicious behavior.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, Obfuscated 0.8, Malware 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; no issues.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import from local modules.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states no evidence of malicious activity, only obfuscated names.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.7, Obfuscated 0.6, Malware 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Slightly lower confidence, but justified. The malware score remains 0, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import symbols.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Similar reasoning; no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.8, Obfuscated 0.7, Malware 0, Risk 0.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import with obfuscated identifiers.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No evidence of malicious activity, just obfuscated names.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, Obfuscated 0.7, Malware 0, Risk 0.1.\n- **Assessment:** Appropriate; the low malware score aligns with the lack of suspicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Import symbols.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No suspicious activity; only obfuscated identifiers.\n- **Scores:** Confidence 0.6, Obfuscated 0.8, Malware 0, Risk 0.2.\n- **Assessment:** Reasonable; no issues.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. The code only imports symbols with obfuscated names. No malicious code or data handling is visible.\n\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning?**  \n  No. All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious activity and note obfuscation as a potential concern but not proof of malicious intent.\n\n- **Scores justification:**  \n  Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscation scores are high, reflecting the obfuscated symbol names. The security risk scores are low, consistent with the code snippet.\n\n- **Potential improvements:**  \n  Since the obfuscated names could be a sign of concealment, some might argue to assign a slightly higher risk score if this pattern appears elsewhere in the project. However, based solely on this snippet, the current scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct; no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** ~0.7 (consistent with the obfuscated symbol names)\n- **Risk score:** ~0.1-0.2 (minimal risk based on this snippet)\n\n---\n\n### **Summary:**\nAll reports are consistent with the code's nature. They correctly identify only import statements with obfuscated identifiers, with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scoring aligns well with the observations.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**\n- The overall malware score should remain at **0**.\n- The obfuscated score can stay around **0.7**.\n- The security risk score should be low, around **0.1-0.2**.\n\n**No significant changes needed.**",
