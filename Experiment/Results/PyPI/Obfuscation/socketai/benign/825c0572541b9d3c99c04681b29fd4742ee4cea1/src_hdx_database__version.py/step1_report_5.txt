{
  "purpose": "Define version information and conditional type annotations for a Python package.",
  "sources": "The code reads the boolean value of 'BwSTqLDSLkmVkKjVkjKAWpggftrDICSU' to determine type annotations, and assigns version strings and tuples.",
  "sinks": "There are no apparent sinks where untrusted data is processed or could lead to leaks or vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "The boolean flag controls the type annotation assignment; version data is hardcoded and directly assigned, with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'BwSTqLDSLkmVkKjVkjKAWpggftrDICSU' appears as an obfuscated or randomly generated name; the code contains unnecessary complexity for simple version assignment. The conditional inclusion of type hints based on a static flag is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version variables and a flag controlling whether detailed type annotations are included. The flag is statically set to False, so type annotations are not imported or used. Version info is hardcoded as '1.3.6'. The obfuscated variable names suggest possible code obfuscation or generated code, but there is no malicious behavior or suspicious activity. The code is benign, simply setting version info with obfuscated variable names. No data leaks, external input handling, or harmful actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily setting version information with obfuscated variable names. There is no malicious behavior, no data flow from untrusted sources, and no security risks detected. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not indicate malicious intent.",
