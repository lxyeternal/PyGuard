  "purpose": "Define version information for the package, including version string and tuple, with obfuscated variable names and conditional type annotations.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version string and tuple assignments; the boolean flag controlling type annotations.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external input; no data leaks or external effects.",
  "flows": "Static assignment of version info; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; conditional import and type aliasing that are inactive due to the flag being False.",
  "analysis": "The code defines static version info with obfuscated variable names. The boolean flag controlling type annotations is set to False, rendering the conditional import and type aliasing inactive. No external input, network activity, or malicious code is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, serving only to obscure variable names without any malicious intent. The code is benign, with no security vulnerabilities or malicious behavior detected. The obfuscated variable names and dead code paths do not pose security risks but could impact readability and maintainability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign version info declaration with superficial obfuscation. No malware, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.",
