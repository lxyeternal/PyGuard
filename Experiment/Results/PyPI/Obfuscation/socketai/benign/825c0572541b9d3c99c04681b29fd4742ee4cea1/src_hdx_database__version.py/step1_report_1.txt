  "purpose": "Define version information and conditional type annotation assignment for a Python package",
  "sources": "Hardcoded version strings and conditional boolean variable",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted input or perform data leakage",
  "flows": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional import that does not execute if the flag is false",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated variable name (BwSTqLDSLkmVkKjVkjKAWpggftrDICSU) controlling a conditional import; the import and type alias are conditionally executed but currently set to not run",
  "analysis": "The code defines package version info with hardcoded strings and a tuple of version parts. The boolean variable BwSTqLDSLkmVkKjVkjKAWpggftrDICSU is set to False, preventing the import and type alias from executing. The obfuscated variable name suggests either obfuscation or an attempt to conceal code logic, but it doesn't perform any malicious activity. All code is straightforward, only involving variable assignment and conditional import, with no data leaks, network activity, or code injection. No malicious behaviors, backdoors, or suspicious data handling are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, mainly setting version info with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious intent. The conditional import is harmless and inactive due to the flag being False. Overall, there are no signs of malware or security risks.",
