  "purpose": "Define version information and type hints for the package, with conditional import based on a flag.",
  "sources": "The flag BwSTqLDSLkmVkKjVkjKAWpggftrDICSU and the string assignments for version and version_tuple.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output operations; no data leaks or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "The conditional flag determines the type hinting for 'peClfBZscJgrHlSymijLcacLwAKHFSZl' and 'version_tuple', but does not lead to any data flow issues.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking variable names and a boolean flag controlling imports; no malicious behavior, but obfuscation may suggest intent to hide or complicate analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily declares module version information and includes an obfuscated flag that controls a conditional import. The flag is set to False, so type hints are defaulted to 'object'. When True, specific type hints involving 'Tuple' and 'Union' are imported, but this does not influence runtime behavior. All variables are assigned static strings and tuples indicating version info. No user input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but not malicious; they do not perform any harmful actions or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version declaration with obfuscated variable names and conditional type hint imports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal simple version info declarations, but no malicious intent is detectable.",
