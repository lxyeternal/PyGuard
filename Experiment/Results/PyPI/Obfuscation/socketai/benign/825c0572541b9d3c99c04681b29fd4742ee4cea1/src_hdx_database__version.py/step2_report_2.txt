  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is straightforward: it defines version info with hardcoded strings and tuples.\n- There is an obfuscated variable name controlling a conditional import and type alias, but the flag is set to False, so the code paths that depend on it are inactive.\n- No untrusted input, network activity, or dynamic code execution is present.\n- The variable names are obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to conceal code intent, but no malicious behavior is evident.\n- All reports agree that the code is benign and primarily for version declaration.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations on code presence and logic:\n- The code snippets match the description: version strings, version tuples, conditional import based on a boolean flag, and obfuscated variable names.\n- No issues with the actual code logic or syntax.\n- No evidence of data leaks, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- The conditional import and type aliasing are unnecessary given the flag is False, but this is not a security issue—more of a code quality or maintainability concern.\n- The obfuscated variable names serve no functional purpose and could hinder readability, but do not introduce security risks.\n- No actual errors or malicious flaws are present.\n\n### Scores review:\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are high (0.6-0.8), reflecting the obfuscated variable names, which is reasonable.\n- Security risk scores are 0, consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities.\n\n### Justification for risk scores > 0.5:\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate.\n- The highest confidence is placed on benign intent, with no signs of malicious activity.\n\n### Malware score:\n- All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there's no evidence of malicious behavior.\n\n### Assumptions and claims:\n- The reports do not assume malicious intent; they correctly identify the obfuscation as superficial.\n- No claims about vulnerabilities are based on unfounded assumptions.\n\n### Consistency:\n- The scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The obfuscation score is justified given the variable names, but does not imply malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**My own estimates:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 (variable names are obfuscated but not malicious)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to obfuscation, which is not inherently malicious)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is benign, with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious intent. The conditional import is inactive and harmless. No security risks or malware are present.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nAll reports are accurate in their benign assessment. The scores are reasonable and consistent with the code's nature. No adjustments needed.",
