  "sinks": "Assignment of version strings and tuple; no untrusted data handling or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Conditional import based on the boolean flag; straightforward assignment of version data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, conditional import that appears to be a dead code path, no real malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version variables, with a boolean flag that, if True, would import typing constructs. However, the flag is set to False, so the code defaults to defining variables as objects. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the actual code simply assigns static version information. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, code injection, or malicious logic. The conditional import appears unnecessary and could be a vestige of obfuscation or a dead code path, but it doesn't present any malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines version variables with obfuscated names and a conditional import that does not execute. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks detected. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly to hide intent, but no malicious activity is present.",
