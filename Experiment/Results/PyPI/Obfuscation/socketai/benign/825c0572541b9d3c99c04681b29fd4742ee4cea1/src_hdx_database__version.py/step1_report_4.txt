  "sources": "Reading the value of the boolean variable BwSTqLDSLkmVkKjVkjKAWpggftrDICSU",
  "sinks": "Assignment of version and version_tuple variables, no untrusted data flow or external input usage",
  "flows": "Boolean flag controls type alias assignment, but does not process external data or user input",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, but no malicious or suspicious code behavior; the conditional type alias is redundant but harmless",
  "analysis": "The code defines version variables and a boolean flag with a obfuscated name. The flag controls whether a type alias is set to a tuple of ints/str or to object. The version variables are assigned fixed string and tuple values. No input reading, data leakage, or suspicious behavior detected. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide simple version info handling, but does not introduce malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily defining version info with an obfuscated style. No malicious or security risks detected.",
