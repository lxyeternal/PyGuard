  "purpose": "A complex PostgreSQL database utility class supporting connection setup, SSH tunneling, schema management, reflection, and batch data insertion.",
  "sources": "Connection parameters, environment variables, external modules like sshtunnel, configuration inputs, and reflection points in SQLAlchemy.",
  "sinks": "SQLAlchemy engine and session operations, schema creation/drop, data insertion points, reflection and view creation.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and configuration data flow into engine/session creation, schema management, and data insertion functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic import of 'sshtunnel', optional SSH tunneling, schema drop/create operations, no hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code is a legitimate database utility for PostgreSQL, featuring connection management, optional SSH tunneling, schema operations, and reflection. Obfuscation appears intentional but not malicious. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious code snippets are present. The dynamic import and schema functions are standard for such utilities. The obfuscation level varies but is justified by the naming conventions. Overall, the code aligns with typical database management modules, with low malware and risk scores.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex database utility module with no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. Obfuscation is likely for code concealment or complexity, not malicious intent. The low malware and risk scores are justified, and the overall assessment indicates safety for use with proper access controls.",
