{
  "purpose": "Defines a timezone-aware datetime type decorator and a declarative base class with dynamic table naming, obfuscated for concealment or protection.",
  "sources": "Import from '.utils', class and method definitions, usage of external utility function",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or network activity observed within this code fragment",
  "flows": "Timezone normalization in the custom type decorator; class attribute referencing external utility for table name generation",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names; import from '.utils' with an external utility function; potential typo in decorator '@declared_attr.directive'",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard timezone-aware datetime handling in SQLAlchemy, with obfuscated naming possibly for concealment. The external utility function's purpose is unknown, posing a potential security concern. No malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The decorator usage appears incorrect, which could cause runtime errors but does not imply malicious intent. The obfuscation and external dependency warrant caution but are not definitive indicators of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate ORM setup for timezone-aware datetime handling, with obfuscation and external dependency that should be verified. No active malicious activity is detected, but further review of the external utility function is recommended before deployment.",
