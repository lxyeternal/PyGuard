  "purpose": "Define custom SQLAlchemy data type for timezone-aware datetime handling and a declarative base class with dynamic table naming.",
  "sources": "Imports modules, defines classes, and methods that process datetime objects and define ORM models.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing or external communication.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; code primarily defines data structures and conversions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names; no explicit security flaws, but unconventional naming can hinder understanding and may obscure malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines a custom SQLAlchemy TypeDecorator to handle timezone-aware datetime objects, converting them to naive UTC datetimes for storage. It also defines a declarative base class with a dynamic table name generator based on the class name, using an external utility function. No code injection, network activity, or data leaks are present. The obfuscated class and method names are unusual but not inherently malicious. There are no hardcoded secrets, no suspicious external calls, and no evident malware behavior. The code appears to serve a standard ORM purpose with some obfuscation, possibly for code obfuscation or intellectual property protection.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily defines ORM-related classes and datetime handling with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or malware. The obfuscation may be intentional to hinder readability but does not indicate malicious intent. Security risks are minimal.",
