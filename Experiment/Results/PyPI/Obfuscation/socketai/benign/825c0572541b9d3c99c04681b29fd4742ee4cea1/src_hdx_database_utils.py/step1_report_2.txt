  "sources": "Input parameter WLGvyClCRDOTjZPWFaUIDHHcWueHIAgZ",
  "sinks": "re.sub function applying regex replacement, returning the transformed string",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex substitution -> string manipulation (lowercase and lstrip) -> output",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but this is not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The function takes a string input, applies a regex to insert underscores before uppercase letters following lowercase letters or digits, then converts the string to lowercase and strips leading underscores. No untrusted data sources or external calls are present. The code appears to perform a standard string transformation from CamelCase to snake_case without any suspicious behavior. Obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but may suggest obfuscation or code generation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward string manipulation utility converting CamelCase to snake_case. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility function.",
