  "purpose": "The function converts a CamelCase string to snake_case.",
  "sources": "Input parameter WLGvyClCRDOTjZPWFaUIDHHcWueHIAgZ, which is a string provided to the function.",
  "sinks": "The output of the function, returning a modified string, which could potentially be used in file names, identifiers, or other contexts.",
  "flows": "The input string is processed by a regex substitution to insert underscores before uppercase letters, then converted to lowercase and leading underscores are stripped, producing snake_case.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and non-descriptive; the regex uses lookbehind and lookahead assertions that are standard for case conversion, with no suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, network access, or other malicious indicators are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward utility to convert CamelCase to snake_case. It employs a regex substitution to insert underscores before uppercase letters following lowercase or digit characters. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic is standard string processing. No data leakage, input/output anomalies, or malicious behavior are evident. The code does not perform any network activity, file operations, or sensitive data handling beyond string transformation. Given the simplicity and benign purpose, there are no signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign utility function for string format conversion with no malicious behavior detected. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but may be for code obfuscation or simply stylistic. Overall, the code is safe and unlikely to be malicious.",
