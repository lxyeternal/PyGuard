  "purpose": "Convert CamelCase or PascalCase strings into snake_case format using regex substitution.",
  "sources": "Input string parameter WLGvyClCRDOTjZPWFaUIDHHcWueHIAgZ",
  "sinks": "The function returns the transformed string; no external data or untrusted sinks involved.",
  "flows": "Input string -> regex substitution -> lowercasing and lstrip -> output string",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but this is superficial and not suspicious; no malicious patterns or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard regex-based transformation from CamelCase to snake_case. It reads a string input, applies a regex pattern to insert underscores before uppercase letters that are either preceded by lowercase/digit characters or followed by lowercase characters, then lowercases and strips leading underscores. No external data sources, sinks, or malicious behaviors are present. The regex pattern is common for such string conversions. Obfuscated variable names are likely for code minification or stylistic purposes, not malicious intent. No signs of data leakage, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code are evident. The malware score is appropriately zero; the obfuscation score is moderate due to variable names but not suspicious; the security risk score is very low, reflecting the benign nature of the utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward utility for converting CamelCase to snake_case. The obfuscation of variable names is superficial and not indicative of malicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the benign analysis. No evidence of malware, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities is found. The overall security risk is minimal, and the code can be considered safe.",
