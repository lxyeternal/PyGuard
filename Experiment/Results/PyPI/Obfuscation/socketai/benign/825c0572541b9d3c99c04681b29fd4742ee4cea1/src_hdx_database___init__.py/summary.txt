  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing only internal static imports with obfuscated names. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is present. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score should be set to 0, and overall security risk remains very low."
