{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific attributes from internal modules within a package, likely for versioning and database functionality.",
  "sources": "Imports from ._version and .database modules",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from external sources to sinks; static imports only",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names (e.g., GKuKjXtHidWXtajaELOVfkWcFpdbiOdi, hvWsUFGYrKYgNHVGDklBQyivrAcBaaIm), which may suggest an attempt to conceal intent",
  "analysis": "The code imports attributes from internal modules with nonsensical variable names. No dynamic execution, user input, or network communication present. The obfuscated names could be an attempt at hiding malicious intent or simply an obfuscation tactic to deter analysis. No clear malicious behavior or security risks are apparent based solely on these import statements. The code does not perform any operations beyond imports, so no data leakage, injection, or malicious activity can be identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with nonsensical variable names but only performs static imports. There is no evident malicious behavior, data leak, or security risk based on this fragment alone. The obfuscation warrants cautious review, but no active threats are apparent from this snippet.",
