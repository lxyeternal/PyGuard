{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific variables from internal modules, likely for versioning and database access within a package.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._version and .database",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or user input; no network, file, or sensitive data handling observed",
  "flows": "Imports variables from internal modules; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks",
  "anomalies": "All imported variables are named with obfuscated identifiers; no clear purpose or context is provided for these variables.",
  "analysis": "The code imports obfuscated variable names from internal modules, which could indicate an attempt to hide the purpose of the variables. There is no indication of data input, user interaction, or network activity. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions but the obfuscation raises suspicion about hidden intent. Without additional context, the purpose of these variables remains unclear, but no direct malicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but appears to only perform internal variable imports without executing any malicious actions. The obfuscation might be for hiding internal implementation details rather than malicious intent. No active security risks or malware behaviors are evident from this snippet.",
