  "purpose": "Importing version information and database components with obfuscated names",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: ._version and .database",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive operations; only internal imports",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers are heavily obfuscated, using random, non-descriptive names. No actual code logic or data manipulation present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three items: one version variable and two database components, all with obfuscated names. There are no functions, no data processing, and no network or file I/O. The obfuscated naming may indicate an attempt to hide purpose or just code obfuscation. The snippet does not perform any malicious actions like data exfiltration, code injection, or system modification. The absence of logic suggests this is a typical import statement, albeit with suspiciously obfuscated names.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to only perform obfuscated imports without any malicious behavior or security risk evident. It seems to be a standard import pattern with deliberate obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not directly indicate malicious intent.",
