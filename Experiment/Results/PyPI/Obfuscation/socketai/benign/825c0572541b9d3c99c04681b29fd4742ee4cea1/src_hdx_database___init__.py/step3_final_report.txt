{
  "purpose": "Static import of internal modules with obfuscated variable names, likely for versioning and database components.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (. _version and .database).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows; purely static imports.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static import references.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names; no functional code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three import statements importing a version variable and two database components, all with heavily obfuscated identifiers. There is no data processing, network activity, or other behavior. The obfuscation could be for internal reasons or to hide details but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The absence of dynamic code, data leaks, or external interactions suggests benign behavior. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but malware and security risks are minimal given the static nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing only internal static imports with obfuscated names. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is present. The obfuscation warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious behavior. The malware score should be set to 0, and overall security risk remains very low.",
