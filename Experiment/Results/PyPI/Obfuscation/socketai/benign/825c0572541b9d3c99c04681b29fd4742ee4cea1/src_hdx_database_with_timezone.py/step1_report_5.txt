{
  "purpose": "Define a SQLAlchemy declarative base class with a dynamic attribute generator.",
  "sources": "Import from sqlalchemy.orm and a local utils module; class name and __name__ attribute.",
  "sinks": "None identified explicitly; no direct data leakage or untrusted input handling.",
  "flows": "Class definition uses __name__ to generate attribute via external function, but no untrusted input flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Use of @declared_attr.directive is unusual; typically should be @declared_attr. The attribute name appears to be misspelled or incorrect syntax; could be a typo or a non-standard decorator usage.",
  "analysis": "The code imports SQLAlchemy ORM components and defines a class inheriting from DeclarativeBase. It attempts to define a class attribute using @declared_attr.directive, which seems to be a typo; the correct decorator should likely be @declared_attr. The method returns a function call from a local utils module, passing the class's __name__, which could generate dynamic attribute names or values. No external input, user input, or untrusted data sources are evident. The code does not perform any network operations, file I/O, or data manipulation that could indicate malicious activity. The suspicious part is the unusual decorator usage, which may be a typo or could cause runtime errors, but alone does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard SQLAlchemy ORM class with a possibly incorrect decorator syntax. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual decorator might be a typo or code mistake rather than an attack.",
