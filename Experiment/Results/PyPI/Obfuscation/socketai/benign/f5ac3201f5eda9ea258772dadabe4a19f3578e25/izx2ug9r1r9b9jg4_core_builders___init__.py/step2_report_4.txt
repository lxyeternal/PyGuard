  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, focusing on the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring justification.\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- The code is minimal, primarily importing obfuscated symbols from internal modules and exposing them via `__all__`.\n- The obfuscated names (e.g., `dJDeEreHICjBWLSyBLIedqtxLnhmGeiQ`, `hZZvknaJJmYehwZmJivjZruymGhibBnX`) are suspicious, as such naming often indicates code obfuscation or concealment.\n- There are no visible malicious actions in this snippet—no network calls, eval, exec, or data leaks.\n- The main concern is the obfuscation and potential for dynamic or malicious behavior hidden within the imported symbols.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code itself does not contain any malicious or security-critical logic.\n- The obfuscated import names could potentially be used elsewhere for malicious purposes, especially if invoked dynamically.\n- The lack of usage of imported symbols here is typical for a module that re-exports internal components, but the obfuscation raises suspicion.\n\n### Errors, flaws, or mistakes:\n- No explicit coding errors are present.\n- The report's analysis correctly notes the obfuscation and potential concerns.\n- The scoring for malware (mostly 0.2) seems cautious but perhaps slightly conservative, given no direct malicious activity is demonstrated.\n\n### Score analysis:\n- **Obfuscated:** High (around 0.7-0.8) across reports, justified by the naming.\n- **Malware:** Low (0.2) — appropriate unless evidence of malicious behavior is found.\n- **Security Risk:** Moderate (0.2-0.3) — reasonable given obfuscation but no direct threats.\n\n### Justification for higher risk scores:\n- The obfuscation alone warrants caution, especially if these symbols are used dynamically.\n- Without examining `_menu` and `_terminal`, we cannot rule out malicious code inside those modules.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are generally reasonable; however, if these obfuscated symbols are used elsewhere for dynamic execution, the malware score should be increased.\n- The risk score could be elevated slightly if the context suggests these symbols are invoked in a way that could execute malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** Should remain low unless further evidence suggests malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Remain high due to naming patterns.\n- **Risk score:** Should stay moderate, reflecting potential concealment but no confirmed malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0.2 (consistent with cautious suspicion but no direct evidence)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 (due to the nature of the names)\n- **Risk:** 0.3 (moderate, considering obfuscation and potential for misuse)\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code appears benign in isolation but the obfuscated identifiers are a red flag for potential concealment. Without further context or inspection of the imported modules, the risk remains moderate, and the malware score should stay low unless additional evidence emerges.",
