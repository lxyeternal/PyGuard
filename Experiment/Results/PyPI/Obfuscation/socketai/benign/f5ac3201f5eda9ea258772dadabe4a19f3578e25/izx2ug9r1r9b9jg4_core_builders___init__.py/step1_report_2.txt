{
  "purpose": "This module exports two classes or functions, 'MenuBuilder' and 'TerminalBuilder', for use in other parts of the application.",
  "sources": "The code imports two entities, '_menu' and '_terminal', from local modules and accesses specific symbols 'dJDeEreHICjBWLSyBLIedqtxLnhmGeiQ' and 'hZZvknaJJmYehwZmJivjZruymGhibBnX'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the imported symbols, which could be used later for dynamic execution, reflection, or other operations if they are functions or executable code.",
  "flows": "The flow involves importing obfuscated symbols from local modules, but these are not directly executed or invoked within this snippet; they may be used elsewhere in the project.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbols are named with seemingly random, obfuscated strings, which can be a sign of code obfuscation or malicious hiding. The module does not explicitly use these symbols, but their presence suggests potential dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports two entities with obfuscated names from local modules, which might be normal or might indicate an attempt to hide functionality. The __all__ list exposes only 'MenuBuilder' and 'TerminalBuilder', suggesting these are intended public interfaces. The obfuscated imports are not used directly here, raising suspicion that they could be used elsewhere for dynamic code execution, which could be malicious if misused. No explicit malicious actions such as network activity, file operations, or credential handling are evident in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple module exposing two public classes or functions, but the use of obfuscated imported symbols raises some concern about potential hidden or malicious behavior, especially if these symbols are used dynamically elsewhere. No definitive malicious activity is observed in this snippet alone, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review of the entire package.",
