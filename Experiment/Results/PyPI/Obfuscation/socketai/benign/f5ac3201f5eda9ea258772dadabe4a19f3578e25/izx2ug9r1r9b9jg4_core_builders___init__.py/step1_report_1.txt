{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be defining a Python module that imports specific components from internal submodules and exposes them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules: ._menu and ._terminal",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data handling or external communication shown",
  "flows": "Imported functions/classes (dJDeEreHICjBWLSyBLIedqtxLnhmGeiQ, hZZvknaJJmYehwZmJivjZruymGhibBnX) are exposed via __all__, but no further processing shown",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking function or variable names in import statements; no usage of eval, exec, or network calls; code is minimal and standard in structure",
  "analysis": "The code imports two entities with obfuscated names from internal modules, likely for internal use, and defines __all__ for exports. No suspicious logic, data flow, or external interactions are present. The obfuscated names may suggest intentional concealment but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or malicious behaviors are evident. The code is minimal and appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a straightforward module setup with obfuscated internal imports and no evident malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated names alone do not imply malicious intent; they may be internal identifiers. Overall, the code is benign.",
