  "purpose": "Re-exporting specific classes or functions from internal modules for external use",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules _menu and _terminal",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted sources; purely importing internal symbols and exposing them via __all__",
  "anomalies": "Unusual: imported symbols have non-descriptive, seemingly random names, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated; no visible code execution or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code imports specific symbols from internal modules with non-standard, obfuscated names, then exposes them via __all__. The import statements do not process external input or handle untrusted data. The naming suggests potential obfuscation or code generation, which can sometimes be used to hide malicious intent, but alone, these are not conclusive. The code itself is minimal and only manages namespace exposure without performing operations that could be malicious or risky.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module re-export pattern with obfuscated internal symbol names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues based on this snippet. The unusual symbol names could be benign or potentially designed to conceal, but no malicious activity is evident.",
