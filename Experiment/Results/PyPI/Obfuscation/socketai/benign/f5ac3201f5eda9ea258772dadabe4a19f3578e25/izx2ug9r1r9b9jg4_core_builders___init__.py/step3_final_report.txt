  "purpose": "Minimal module setup importing obfuscated internal components and exposing them via __all__.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution beyond import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated identifiers for imported symbols; no functional code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of import statements with obfuscated names and an __all__ list. No malicious actions, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscated names suggest potential concealment but are not inherently malicious. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0-0.2, obfuscated=0.7-0.8, risk=0.1-0.3) are consistent with the evidence, reflecting suspicion due to obfuscation but no active malicious behavior. Further review of the internal modules is recommended to confirm their safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign but is suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious activity is present in this snippet. The current scores are appropriate; further inspection of the internal modules is advised to rule out hidden malicious code.",
