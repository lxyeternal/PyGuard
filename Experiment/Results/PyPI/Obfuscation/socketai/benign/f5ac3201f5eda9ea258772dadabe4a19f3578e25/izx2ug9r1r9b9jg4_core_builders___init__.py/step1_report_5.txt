{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions or classes from internal modules and defines the public API of the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from ._menu and ._terminal modules.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is apparent; imports are static references.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers (dJDeEreHICjBWLSyBLIedqtxLnhmGeiQ and hZZvknaJJmYehwZmJivjZruymGhibBnX) appear obfuscated or autogenerated, which is unusual and could be suspicious. The code lacks any functional implementation or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions or classes with obfuscated names from internal modules, likely for internal use. The use of obfuscated identifiers and the absence of any executable code or logic suggest possible concealment of functionality, but no malicious behavior can be confirmed solely from this snippet. No sensitive data handling, network activity, or security-critical operations are present. The __all__ declaration exposes specific public names, consistent with standard package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and appears to serve as an internal module interface. The obfuscated import names could be benign or a form of code concealment, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security issues in this fragment.",
