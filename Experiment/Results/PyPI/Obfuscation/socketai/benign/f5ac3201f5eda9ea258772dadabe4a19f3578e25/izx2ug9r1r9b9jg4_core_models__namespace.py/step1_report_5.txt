  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic data model with two fields, one of which references an imported class.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the 'pydantic' package import and from the local module '_constraint'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data outputs are evident in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into the model fields, primarily for validation; no external or untrusted flow is apparent.",
  "anomalies": "The class name and field names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could indicate attempts to hide purpose. The imported class name is a long, cryptic string, which is unusual. The field definitions contain the same string for both the variable name and the 'description' attribute, suggesting obfuscation or auto-generated code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic model with two fields. One field references an imported class with an obscure, auto-generated name, which may be used to obfuscate intent or simply be a placeholder. Both fields have the same obscure string assigned as a description, which is unusual. No code injection, network activity, or malicious behavior is evident. The structure follows normal Pydantic patterns without any suspicious dynamic execution, file access, or environment variable misuse.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated or auto-generated data model definition with no clear malicious behavior. No security threats or malware indicators are present based on this snippet.",
