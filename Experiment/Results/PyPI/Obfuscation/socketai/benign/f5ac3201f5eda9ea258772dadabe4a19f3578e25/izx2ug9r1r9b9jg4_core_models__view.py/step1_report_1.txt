  "purpose": "Define a Pydantic model for a view configuration with associated attributes and a callable function.",
  "sources": "Input data comes from the initialization of the Pydantic model via its fields.",
  "sinks": "Callable field 'kdzztNzBbnJoVixTyqLzoEECYYlnAXrs' potentially executes external or user-provided functions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model instantiation through the fields to the callable execution if used elsewhere in application.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a generic Callable type without restrictions; no explicit validation or sanitization for the callable. The import of a private module suggests custom or obscure dependencies, which may hide malicious code. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious strings are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a Pydantic data model with fields for view name, description, a function, an optional confirmation message, and a wait flag. The 'kdzztNzBbnJoVixTyqLzoEECYYlnAXrs' field is a Callable, which could be used to execute arbitrary code if passed untrusted input. The import from a relative module with an obscure name may conceal malicious code, but no direct malicious activity is evident from this fragment. No other suspicious behavior, such as network calls, data leakage, or backdoors, is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward model definition with no clear malicious intent. The only potential risk lies in the callable field, which could execute arbitrary code if misused, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage in this snippet.",
