{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific attributes from internal modules and defines an __all__ list for exports, likely part of a larger package or library.",
  "sources": "Imports from internal modules: ._cli, ._namespace, ._view",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data, outputs are standard module attributes",
  "flows": "Imported module attributes are assigned to local names, then exported via __all__",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (HOTYCtGFvlSMNOOXklMMczfVaQIkGxhN, osHdjiobFAIFSJvkJiLxqlmLFBTqwxoE, QkqoIbZplzTtEwXPPSwyvfEAWnRGnhKn) which appear to be obfuscated or auto-generated; no actual usage of these variables is shown beyond import",
  "analysis": "The code imports three elements with obfuscated names from internal modules, which might suggest an attempt to hide behavior or simply code obfuscation. There is no code execution, data handling, or suspicious behavior visible. The __all__ list indicates an intention to expose certain models. The absence of any executable logic, conditional branches, or data handling reduces suspicion. No malicious patterns, such as network activity, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward module interface with obfuscated internal variables. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual variable names are likely obfuscation or auto-generated identifiers without malicious intent.",
