  "purpose": "Module interface defining public API symbols with internally obfuscated component imports.",
  "sources": "Internal module files (_cli, _namespace, _view) from which obfuscated symbols are imported.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication present; code only imports and exports symbols.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; static import of internal components and declaration of __all__.",
  "anomalies": "Use of non-descriptive, obfuscated import identifiers; absence of usage or instantiation; minimal logic.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three internal components with obfuscated names, likely to conceal internal implementation details. It then declares a public API with clear symbol names. No malicious logic, network activity, or data processing is visible. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive of malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports reflect high obfuscation suspicion but low malware and risk, which aligns with the code's content. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to confirm the absence of hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module interface with obfuscated internal imports. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation warrants caution and further inspection of the imported modules, but overall, the security risk remains very low.",
