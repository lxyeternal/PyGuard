{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a module that imports various components and exposes certain attributes via __all__ for use in other parts of a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: 'features', 'core', and 'core.handlers'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or execution flows that could lead to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The code primarily imports components and defines __all__; there are no data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The import names from 'core.handlers' are obfuscated (e.g., wzjPcNMYHFotvQksSoPOfpknpfOcxMFr), which is unusual and suspicious as it could hide malicious or obfuscated code. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code structure is straightforward, performing relative imports and defining the __all__ list for module exports. The use of obfuscated identifiers for imported handlers suggests possible hiding of malicious intent or code concealment. However, no actual code execution, data handling, or suspicious logic is present in this fragment. The purpose seems to be module organization, but the obfuscated names raise concern.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet primarily organizes module imports and exports. The obfuscated import names are suspicious and warrant further review of the 'core.handlers' module. On its own, there is no direct malicious behavior or security risk evident, but the obfuscation raises a low to moderate concern.",
