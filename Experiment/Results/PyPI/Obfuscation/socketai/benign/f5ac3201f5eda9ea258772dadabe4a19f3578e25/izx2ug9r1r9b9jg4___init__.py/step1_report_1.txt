  "purpose": "This code appears to be part of a Python package or module that imports various components and defines an __all__ list for exporting certain names.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: 'features', 'core', 'core.handlers'. No external data sources or user input read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no code executes untrusted data or writes sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; no dynamic code execution or data manipulation observed.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking identifiers in the imports (e.g., wzjPcNMYHFotvQksSoPOfpknpfOcxMFr), which could be intentionally obfuscated or auto-generated. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward imports from local modules and defines an __all__ list to specify exported symbols. The imported names from 'core.handlers' are obfuscated, which is unusual and could be suspicious if the purpose is unclear. However, the overall structure is consistent with typical Python package initialization files. No evidence of malicious code, data leakage, or malicious behavior was found. The obfuscated import names could be benign or could warrant further investigation, but within this snippet, no malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard module initialization with obfuscated import names, which may be for internal reasons. No malicious behavior or security risks are apparent based on this snippet.",
