{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a module initializer, importing internal features, core components, and handlers, and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Relative imports from local modules: .features, .core, and .core.handlers",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external sinks are present in this code snippet",
  "flows": "Import statements load modules; no data flows or external interactions occur",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated handler names (e.g., wzjPcNMYHFotvQksSoPOfpknpfOcxMFr) are unusual and could be suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code is static, performing only imports and defining __all__. The obfuscated identifiers in the imports are atypical but may be auto-generated or for internal obfuscation. No malicious code, network activity, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscated names raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned by reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.6, risk=0.2) are consistent with the static nature and obfuscation concern. Further review of the imported classes/functions is recommended to verify their safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, serving as a module setup with obfuscated import names. No active malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation warrants further review but does not justify high security scores. The current low malware and risk scores are appropriate.",
