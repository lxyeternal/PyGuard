{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that imports components from relative modules and exports a list of symbols, likely for use in a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: 'features', 'core', and 'core.handlers'.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data handling, external network connections, or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; the code mainly establishes module exports.",
  "anomalies": "The imported handler names (e.g., 'wzjPcNMYHFotvQksSoPOfpknpfOcxMFr') are obfuscated or non-descriptive, which could be suspicious. No actual usage or execution of these handlers is shown, just their import. No apparent malicious behavior, but obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "analysis": "The code imports several components, including obscurely named handlers, from local modules and defines an export list. There is no evidence of data manipulation, network activity, or execution of untrusted code. The obfuscated handler names are unusual and could be indicative of attempts to conceal malicious intent, but with no further code, this remains speculative. Overall, the code is simple and typical of a module's __init__.py or API surface definition, with no immediate security threats identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code mainly sets up module exports with obfuscated handler names, which may warrant further review but does not currently demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks. No suspicious data flows or external interactions are evident.",
