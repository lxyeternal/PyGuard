{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define module imports and exports for a Python package, organizing features, core components, handlers, and API exports.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules and submodules, including potentially obfuscated handler names.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system commands; no untrusted data handling or external interactions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; imports are static and from internal modules.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of handlers with seemingly random or obfuscated names, which could suggest code obfuscation or malicious intent. No actual code logic, data handling, or dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements and an __all__ declaration, with no function definitions, data processing, or system interactions. The use of obfuscated handler names is unusual but not inherently malicious; it might be a tactic to hide purpose or indicate obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activities like network communication, file modification, or data exfiltration within this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard module import and export setup, with some obfuscated identifiers that could warrant further review but do not necessarily indicate malicious behavior. There is no direct evidence of malware or security risks based solely on this snippet.",
