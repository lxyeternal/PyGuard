  "purpose": "Module that imports an obfuscated or non-descriptive module and defines an export list",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'zsxWKRsddAKKmtiEpyJzlCNPbBsvhowg' and 'handlers'",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; no untrusted data processing or output operations",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths observed",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obscure module name 'zsxWKRsddAKKmtiEpyJzlCNPbBsvhowg' suggests obfuscation or hidden functionality",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module with a non-descriptive, potentially obfuscated name, and another module 'handlers'. The __all__ list indicates public API exposure. There are no other code operations, no data processing, and no apparent malicious activity. The obfuscated import could be used to hide malicious or suspicious behavior, but with no additional code, the risk is limited to suspicion of obfuscation rather than active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and mostly consists of a suspiciously obfuscated import, which warrants caution. However, without further code or context, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The risk level is low, but the obfuscated module warrants further review if more code is provided.",
