  "purpose": "Minimal import statement with an obfuscated module, potentially indicating obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a module with a nonsensical, obfuscated name.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow beyond the import statement.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module name 'zsxWKRsddAKKmtiEpyJzlCNPbBsvhowg'; __all__ references 'models' and 'handlers' which are not defined or imported here.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an obfuscated module and declares __all__ with symbols not defined in this snippet. The obfuscated name raises suspicion of potential malicious intent or obfuscation. No active malicious behavior, data leaks, or code injection is evident. The suspicion is primarily based on the module name's nonsensical nature, which is common in malicious or obfuscated code. The lack of further code limits definitive conclusions, but the import pattern warrants caution. The scores assigned in the reports reflect suspicion due to obfuscation but lack concrete evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet shows a suspicious obfuscated import, which warrants further investigation into the actual module content. No direct malicious activity is demonstrated, but the obfuscation pattern is a red flag. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation, with low malware likelihood given the limited context.",
