  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard initialization and CLI execution script with heavy obfuscation. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity or security risks based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and overall risk scores should remain low unless further suspicious behavior is identified."
