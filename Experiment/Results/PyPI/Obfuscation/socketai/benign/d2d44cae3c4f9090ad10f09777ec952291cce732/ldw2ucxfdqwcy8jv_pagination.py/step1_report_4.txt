  "purpose": "Custom pagination class extending DRF's PageNumberPagination to format paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from rest_framework; class attributes and methods accessing pagination data.",
  "sinks": "Response construction using untrusted data (pagination results).",
  "flows": "Data flows from paginated queryset results into the 'results' field of Response.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and method names are obfuscated, but no suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of DRF's pagination.PageNumberPagination with obfuscated class and method names. It overrides a method to format the response data, returning the count, number of pages, and results. The code does not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. It appears as standard custom pagination logic with intentionally obfuscated identifiers, possibly to hide its purpose, but no malicious intent or suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard custom pagination implementation with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are detected. The obfuscation could be suspicious but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
