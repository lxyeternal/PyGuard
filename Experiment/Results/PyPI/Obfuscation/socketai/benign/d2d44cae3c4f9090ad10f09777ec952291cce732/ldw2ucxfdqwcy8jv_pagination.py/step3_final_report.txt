{
  "purpose": "A custom pagination class extending DRF's PageNumberPagination with obfuscated class and method names, intended to format paginated responses.",
  "sources": "The class reads no external input; it processes data passed to its method for response formatting.",
  "sinks": "The method returns a Response object containing data; no untrusted data sinks or external calls are present.",
  "flows": "Data passed into the method flows directly into the Response payload without validation or sanitization.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, which are unusual and may be intended to conceal purpose; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of DRF's pagination.PageNumberPagination with heavily obfuscated identifiers. It sets a page size attribute and overrides a method to return a paginated response with total count, number of pages, and results. No network activity, secrets, or malicious code are present. The obfuscation is likely an attempt to hide intent but does not introduce malicious behavior. The logic is straightforward and standard for custom pagination. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.2) are consistent with the code's characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated implementation of a pagination class with no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants further review but does not currently indicate malicious intent.",
