  "purpose": "Custom pagination class extending DRF's PageNumberPagination to format the response with count, num_pages, and results.",
  "sources": "Imports from rest_framework for pagination and response, class attributes, and method for response formatting.",
  "sinks": "Response object creation with data parameter, which could include untrusted data if data originates from external sources.",
  "flows": "Data passed into YRyokPpNuvTiXyUvkniAmDBOqTkIXVgJ method flows into Response payload.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and attribute names are obfuscated, which is suspicious. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of DRF's PageNumberPagination with obfuscated class and attribute names, possibly to conceal intent. The method YRyokPpNuvTiXyUvkniAmDBOqTkIXVgJ returns a Response object with pagination info and provided data. No external data sources, environment variables, or suspicious network activity detected. The obfuscation could suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, but there is no direct evidence of malicious actions or malware in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign customization of DRF pagination with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior detected based on this snippet. The obfuscation could warrant further review, but no security risks are evident here.",
