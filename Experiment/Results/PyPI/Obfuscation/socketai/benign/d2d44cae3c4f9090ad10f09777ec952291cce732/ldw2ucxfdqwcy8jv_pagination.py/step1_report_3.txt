  "purpose": "Custom pagination class for Django REST Framework to format paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from rest_framework, data passed to the 'YRyokPpNuvTiXyUvkniAmDBOqTkIXVgJ' method.",
  "sinks": "Response object creation with paginated data.",
  "flows": "Method receives data -> returns a formatted Response with pagination info.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and method names are obfuscated, which is unusual. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of PageNumberPagination with an obfuscated class name and method name. The method wraps the paginated data into a Response object with pagination metadata. The code appears to be straightforward, with no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, hidden network activity, or backdoors. The obfuscation may be for code concealment, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a customized pagination class for API responses. Although the class and method names are obfuscated, the logic is standard and does not show malicious activity. No security risks or malware indications are evident.",
