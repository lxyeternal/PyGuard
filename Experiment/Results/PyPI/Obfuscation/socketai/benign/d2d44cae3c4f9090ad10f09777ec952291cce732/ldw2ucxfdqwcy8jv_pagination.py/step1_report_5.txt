  "purpose": "Custom pagination class for Django REST Framework to format paginated responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from rest_framework (pagination, Response), class attributes, method parameters.",
  "sinks": "Response object returning paginated data.",
  "flows": "Data passed to YRyokPpNuvTiXyUvkniAmDBOqTkIXVgJ method flows into Response payload.",
  "anomalies": "Class name and method name are obfuscated and intentionally nonsensical, no hardcoded secrets, no dynamic code execution, no external network calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a subclass of pagination.PageNumberPagination with an unusual, obfuscated class and method name. It overrides the method to return a paginated response with count, total pages, and results. No suspicious data handling, no external network activity, and no embedded malicious code or backdoors are present. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide intent, but the actual logic is standard and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard custom pagination implementation with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation seems intended to conceal the purpose but does not introduce malicious code.",
