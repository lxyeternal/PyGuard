  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Code input/output operations, third-party library usage, environment variables, network connections, eval/exec statements, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access, eval/exec execution points, data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as data input or environment variables flow into processing functions; untrusted data may reach sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious network activity; code appears benign.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets reviewed show no signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. Scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0, and low security risk (~0.2) are consistent with the benign nature of the code. Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or malicious network activity are detected. The assessments align with the detailed observations, indicating the code is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk score is justified. Current scores are accurate and consistent with the analysis, requiring no adjustments.",
