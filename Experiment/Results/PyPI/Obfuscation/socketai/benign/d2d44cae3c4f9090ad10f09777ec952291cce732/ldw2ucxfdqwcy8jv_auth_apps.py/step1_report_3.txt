  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or functionality within a Python package, but no specific purpose can be conclusively determined without more context.",
  "sources": "Data sources include reading environment variables, configuration files, or input functions (if present). Specific sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, or system command executions, but none are explicitly visible in this code.",
  "flows": "Without explicit source or sink points, no direct source-to-sink flow can be determined from the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "There are no evident hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious imports. The code appears straightforward; no malicious or unusual patterns are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be standard Python with typical library usage. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. No suspicious network activity, credential theft, or malicious system modifications are detected. The structure and variables are clear and conventional.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit signs of malware or malicious intent. It seems to serve a benign purpose, with no evident security risks or suspicious behaviors. The confidence level is high that the code is safe.",
