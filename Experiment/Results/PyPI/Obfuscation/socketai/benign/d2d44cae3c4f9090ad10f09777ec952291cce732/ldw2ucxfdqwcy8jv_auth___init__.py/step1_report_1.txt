  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly a utility or module, but without specific context or comments, the precise purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, user input functions, or data files (if any are present). Since no code is provided, this is unspecified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, system commands, or data output functions. No explicit usage detected without code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks. Due to lack of code, flows cannot be precisely mapped.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated elements, or hard-coded secrets are observable in the provided snippet. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The review is limited by the absence of actual code. Without code content, no source, sink, or flow analysis is possible. No suspicious patterns, malicious functions, or anomalies are detectable from empty input.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the lack of code provided, there are no identifiable malicious behaviors or security issues. The code appears benign, but the absence of content limits a thorough review.",
