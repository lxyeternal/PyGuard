  "purpose": "This code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, its primary purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, or file reads (if any) present at the beginning of the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points, such as network transmission, file writing, or console output, especially if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data may flow from input sources through processing functions to output sinks, possibly involving transformations or external calls.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual dynamic code execution are evident. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly, including initial imports, data handling sections, and output operations. No signs of malicious payloads or obfuscated code were detected. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No suspicious network connections, data leaks, or credential theft mechanisms are evident. All functions seem to perform legitimate tasks without hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious anomalies or malicious patterns detected.",
