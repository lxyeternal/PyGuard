  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security reports for open source Python dependencies, focusing on code analysis, malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, environment variables, user input, external data sources, eval() calls, cryptic variable names.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, data exfiltration points, system commands, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment, user input, external data) to sinks via eval(), string manipulations, or data handling functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval(), obfuscated variable names, cryptic string manipulations, dynamic code execution, hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code with eval() and obfuscation indicates potential malicious intent, especially if used to hide malicious payloads or perform unsafe operations. Absence of code limits analysis; benign code shows straightforward patterns without suspicious features. The presence of obfuscation and eval() usage increases suspicion, warranting higher malware and risk scores. Scores are calibrated based on the evidence, with higher suspicion reflected in elevated scores for obfuscation (0.7) and malware (0.4-0.5).",
  "conclusion": "Most reports without code are correctly scored with low malware and obfuscation levels. Report 5 exhibits signs of obfuscation and risky practices, suggesting moderate suspicion. Slightly increasing malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 and obfuscation to 0.75 would better reflect the observed signs. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, emphasizing caution for code with obfuscation and eval().",
