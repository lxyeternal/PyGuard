  "conclusion": "Most reports without code are correctly scored with low malware and obfuscation levels. Report 5 exhibits signs of obfuscation and risky practices, suggesting moderate suspicion. Slightly increasing malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 and obfuscation to 0.75 would better reflect the observed signs. Overall, the assessments are consistent with the evidence, emphasizing caution for code with obfuscation and eval()."
