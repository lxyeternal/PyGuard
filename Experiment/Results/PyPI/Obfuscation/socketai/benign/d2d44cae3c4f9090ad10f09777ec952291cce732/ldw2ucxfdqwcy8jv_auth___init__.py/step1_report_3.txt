  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script intended for data processing or utility purposes, but without further context or comments, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "It reads data from the 'input_data' variable and possibly from external files or network sources if included elsewhere, but no explicit input functions are present in the provided fragment.",
  "sinks": "The code writes output to 'output_data' and possibly writes files or sends data over the network if such code exists elsewhere, but no such actions are shown in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources to processing functions and then to output destinations. Without explicit data flow paths shown in this fragment, a detailed flow cannot be determined.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious functions are present. The code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not include external data sources, sinks, or complex control flow. It appears benign based on the provided snippet. Lack of comments or unusual constructs suggests no malicious intent. However, without additional context, potential hidden behaviors cannot be entirely ruled out.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems straightforward and benign, with no suspicious patterns or anomalies detected.",
