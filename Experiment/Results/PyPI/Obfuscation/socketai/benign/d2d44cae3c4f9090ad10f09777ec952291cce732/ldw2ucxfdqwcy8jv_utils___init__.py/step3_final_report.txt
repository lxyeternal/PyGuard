  },
  "reasoning": "All reports consistently identify the absence of confirmed malicious activity, with some noting obfuscation and dynamic code features that warrant cautious scoring. The malware score of 0.2 reflects suspicion due to obfuscation but no concrete evidence of malicious payloads. The obfuscated score of 0.7 is justified by mentions of obfuscation and dynamic execution. The moderate security risk score of 0.4 accounts for potential exploitation vectors associated with obfuscation and dynamic code, despite no confirmed malicious activity. This balanced assessment aligns with the collective reasoning and observations across all reports.",
