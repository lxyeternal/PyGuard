  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' (dividend and divisor).",

  "flows": "Input parameters -> division operation -> return result.",
  "anomalies": "No code implementation provided; only comments and parameter descriptions; no executable code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippet is a comment or docstring describing a safe division function but contains no executable code. Without actual code, there are no source-to-sink flows, no data processing, and no security risks. The comments suggest an intention for safe handling, but as-is, it is non-functional.",
  "conclusion": "The code is only a descriptive comment with no actual implementation. There is no malicious behavior or security risk present. The lack of code means no vulnerabilities or anomalies can be detected.",
