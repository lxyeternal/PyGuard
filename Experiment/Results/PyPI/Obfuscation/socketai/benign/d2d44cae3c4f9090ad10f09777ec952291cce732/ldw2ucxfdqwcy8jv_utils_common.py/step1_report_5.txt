  "purpose": "Provide safe division of two numbers, handling ZeroDivisionError and NoneType inputs.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'a' and 'b' (dividend and divisor).",
  "sinks": "Return statement (implied by the comment 'return:') that outputs the result of division.",
  "flows": "Inputs 'a' and 'b' are used in division; the flow would involve passing these inputs to the division operation and then returning the result.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet provided is incomplete; no actual implementation, functions, or operations are shown. The comments suggest intended behavior but no executable code is present. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or obfuscated code are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a comment-based description of a safe division function intended to handle ZeroDivisionError and NoneType inputs. It lacks actual implementation, including input validation, exception handling, or division logic. Without executable code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security issues. The snippet appears to be a placeholder or a documentation comment rather than functional code.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not contain any executable logic or suspicious behavior. It appears to be a comment describing a safe division function, with no signs of malware or security risks.",
