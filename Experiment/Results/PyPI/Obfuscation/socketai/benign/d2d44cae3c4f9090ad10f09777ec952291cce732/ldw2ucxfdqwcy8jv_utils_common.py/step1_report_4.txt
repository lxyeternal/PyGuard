  "purpose": "Safe division of two numbers to prevent ZeroDivisionError and handle NoneType values",
  "sources": "None explicitly; no input reading or data retrieval shown in the snippet",
  "sinks": "Division operation (implied in the description), potential return statement",
  "flows": "Input variables 'a' and 'b' used in division, with handling to prevent errors",
  "anomalies": "No actual implementation code present; only comments and descriptions",
  "analysis": "The provided code fragment contains only comments and descriptive text about safe division. It does not include actual executable code, function definitions, or logic. Without concrete code, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. No suspicious or malicious code patterns are evident, and the description suggests a straightforward utility function intended for safe division. The absence of code prevents any assessment of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is only a descriptive comment about a safe division function with no executable code provided. There is no malicious behavior or security concern in the fragment as presented.",
