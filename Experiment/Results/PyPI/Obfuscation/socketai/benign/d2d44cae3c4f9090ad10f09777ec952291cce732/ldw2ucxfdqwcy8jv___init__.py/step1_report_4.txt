{
  "purpose": "The code appears to assign static string values to variables, possibly for versioning or metadata purposes.",
  "sources": "Direct assignments of string literals to variables.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, no data leaks, or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; variables are assigned static values only.",
  "anomalies": "All variables contain hardcoded strings; no dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code simply defines several variables with hardcoded string values, including a version string, a name, and a license type. The variables are assigned straightforward string literals, with one variable being assigned the value of another. There are no indications of input handling, data processing, or external interactions. The content does not include obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs. The pattern suggests configuration or metadata storage rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains no malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign metadata or configuration data with no indication of sabotage or malicious intent.",
