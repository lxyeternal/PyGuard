  "purpose": "Assigning string values to variables, possibly for later use",
  "sources": "Variables are initialized with string literals",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no untrusted data handling or external data output",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are only assigned values",
  "anomalies": "Variables are assigned hardcoded strings; no dynamic or external input observed",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of variable assignments with static string literals. No functions, input/output operations, or external data handling are present. The variables include version info, author name, license, and some key-value pairs, but nothing indicates malicious intent or obfuscated behavior. The code appears to be configuration or metadata setup without any suspicious logic or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, consisting of static variable assignments with no malicious behavior detected. It does not perform any harmful actions or suspicious activities.",
