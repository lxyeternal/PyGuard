  "conclusion": "The code exhibits insecure token handling practices, including extraction without validation and hardcoded secrets, which pose security risks but do not indicate malicious activity. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score of 0, and the main issue is the insecure implementation rather than active malicious behavior."
