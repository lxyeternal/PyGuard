  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks.",
  "sources": "Standard input, environment variables, module imports, data processing routines, and potential data sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "sinks": "Potential data flows from sources to sinks like network connections, file writes, or system commands, but no malicious activity is observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (e.g., environment variables, input) to sinks (e.g., network, files) without suspicious patterns or malicious payloads.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual code constructs detected; code appears straightforward and benign.",
  "analysis": "Multiple reports consistently indicate minimal or no code, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks. Scores for malware and obfuscation are zero, and security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2). Confidence levels are moderate to high, reflecting thorough but limited code snippets. No suspicious patterns, network activity, or credential handling are present. The assessments align with the benign nature of the code, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no evidence of malware or obfuscation. Security risks are minimal, and the assessments are consistent and justified. The overall scores should remain at malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1, reflecting a very low threat level.",
