  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple Python script that imports modules and performs basic operations, but without additional context or execution logic, its intent is unclear.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules and potentially from environment variables or input functions, but no explicit input sources are visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are present in the code snippet provided.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable source-to-sink data flows; the code mainly consists of imports and basic operations with no data flow patterns indicating malicious intent.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic are evident. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of module imports and basic syntax with no complex logic or data handling. There are no apparent input points, no output points, and no unusual constructs. Since no malicious or suspicious behavior is observable, the code seems benign based on this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, suspicious anomalies, or security risks. The code appears to be a standard, benign Python script.",
