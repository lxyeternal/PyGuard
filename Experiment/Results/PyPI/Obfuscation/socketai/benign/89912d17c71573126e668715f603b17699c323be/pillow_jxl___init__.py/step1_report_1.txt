{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules and attributes from the 'pillow_jxl' package, likely to expose its functionality for use elsewhere.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'pillow_jxl' module and its '__doc__' and '__all__' attributes.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; mainly module imports and attribute assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Simple re-export pattern; no suspicious code or unusual constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module imports and re-exports certain attributes from the 'pillow_jxl' package. There are no functions, no data processing, nor network or system operations. The code appears to be a typical module initialization pattern for exposing package contents. No hardcoded credentials, dynamic code execution, or malicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard module import and re-export pattern with no signs of malicious intent or security risks.",
