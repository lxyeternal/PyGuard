  "purpose": "Re-exporting components from the pillow_jxl package, specifically importing all contents and the JpegXLImagePlugin.",
  "sources": "Import statements from the local module .pillow_jxl and the top-level pillow_jxl module.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data sinks such as network, file writing, or system commands.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only performs import and attribute assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code or hardcoded secrets; no dynamic execution, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports everything from a local module and a specific class from an external module, then assigns the docstring and __all__ attribute if available. This is standard module re-export pattern without any suspicious activity or malicious intent. No data leaks, external communication, or system manipulation observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward re-export of module components, with no malicious behavior or security risks identified.",
