  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code and potential security implications.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Assessment:** The code is primarily unit tests for image format support and metadata integrity. It uses standard libraries and static test data. The only system call executes a module import, which is benign in a controlled test environment.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (clear code)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, mainly due to static tests)\n- **Comments:** The code appears safe. No anomalies or suspicious patterns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, focusing on image processing and metadata verification. Notably, it mentions a suspicious 'os.system' call with a variable 'CkIEbvUSzdxTcwpxuyGenmifzinGpqtr' that is undefined, indicating a bug or typo.\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity, just a questionable code pattern)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (not obfuscated, but buggy)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to the questionable 'os.system' usage and undefined variable)\n- **Comments:** The system call is static and does not perform harmful actions; it's likely a test artifact or typo. No malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on image format and metadata tests. Contains some irregular patterns, such as the use of outdated 'tempfile.mktemp()' and some questionable code snippets, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0.3 (due to outdated practices and some irregular code, but no malicious behavior)\n- **Comments:** Overall, safe. The irregularities are likely bugs or code quality issues, not security concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Similar to previous reports, with emphasis on metadata verification. Mentions obfuscated variable names and some suspicious patterns, but no malicious activity.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (variable names are nonsensical, possibly auto-generated or obfuscated)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (mainly due to obfuscation, but no malicious actions)\n- **Comments:** The obfuscation raises maintainability concerns but not security risks.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Assessment:** Focuses on the same test suite. Highlights the 'os.system' call executing a module import, and an undefined variable, which are bugs or questionable code patterns.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 (some variable names are non-descriptive)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (mainly due to the questionable system call and code irregularities)\n- **Comments:** No evidence of malware or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Estimation:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity. The suspicious 'os.system' calls are static and do not perform harmful actions, just module imports or tests. The undefined variables are likely bugs or artifacts, not malicious code.\n\n- **Obfuscated score:** Some reports note obfuscated or non-descriptive variable names, but overall, the code is not heavily obfuscated or maliciously masked.\n\n- **Risk score:** Given the overall context, the primary concern is code quality and potential bugs, not security risks. The highest risk scores are around 0.3, mainly due to code irregularities and outdated practices, not malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Recommendations:**\n\n- The malware score should remain at **0**; no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The obfuscated score can be **moderate** (~0.2-0.3) due to variable naming issues.\n- The overall security risk should stay low (~0.2-0.3), considering these are test scripts with some code irregularities but no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0.0             |\n| Obfuscated     | ~0.2            |\n| Security Risk  | ~0.2            |\n\nThese estimates reflect the code's purpose as a test suite, with some code irregularities but no signs of supply chain malware or malicious activity.",
