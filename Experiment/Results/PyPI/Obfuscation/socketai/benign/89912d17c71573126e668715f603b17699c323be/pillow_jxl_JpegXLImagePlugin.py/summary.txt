  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate implementation for JPEG XL support in PIL, with obfuscation that warrants cautious review but no evidence of malicious activity. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is low (~0.2). The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.6), reflecting variable name complexity. Overall, the code appears safe but should be reviewed further if used in security-critical environments."
