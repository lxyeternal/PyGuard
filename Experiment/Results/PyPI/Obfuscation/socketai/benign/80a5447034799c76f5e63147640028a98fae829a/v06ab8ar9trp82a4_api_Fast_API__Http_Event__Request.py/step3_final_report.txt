{
  "purpose": "Data container class with obfuscated attribute names, likely used for configuration or tracking within a larger system.",
  "sources": "Class attribute definitions, type annotations, imported modules (Type_Safe, Random_Guid). No input or data reading present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows identified; no network or file operations.",
  "flows": "No executable code or data flow; static class definition only.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated class and attribute names, unused imports, absence of methods or logic, which could be an attempt to conceal intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a data class inheriting from Type_Safe, with attributes typed but not used in any logic. Obfuscation of names and unused imports suggest concealment or auto-generation. No network, file, or executable operations are present. Static analysis shows no malicious behavior, but obfuscation warrants caution. The low malware score (0) aligns with the absence of active malicious code. High obfuscation score (~0.7) reflects naming patterns. Overall risk is low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation, but no active threats are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated data schema with no signs of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. Scores are consistent with the static, non-executable nature of the snippet. Continued contextual review is recommended if part of a larger, obfuscated package.",
