  "conclusion": "The code functions as a request/response handling utility with data cleaning and tracing capabilities. Despite obfuscation and incomplete parts, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but overall, the code appears benign in its current form."
