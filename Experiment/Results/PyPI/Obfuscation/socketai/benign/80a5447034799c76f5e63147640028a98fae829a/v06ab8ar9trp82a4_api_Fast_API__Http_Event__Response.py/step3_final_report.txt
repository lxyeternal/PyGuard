{
  "purpose": "Data container class with obfuscated attribute names, likely used for schema or configuration storage.",
  "sources": "No active data input sources; attributes are statically defined within the class.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data outputs; code does not perform I/O or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow or execution flow; purely a static data structure with attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names, which may suggest concealment or placeholder code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class inheriting from Type_Safe, containing several typed attributes, including custom types like Random_Guid. There are no functions, data processing, or I/O operations. The obfuscated naming raises suspicion but does not indicate active malicious behavior. No evidence of data leaks, code injection, or network activity is present. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The obfuscation score is moderate (~0.7), acknowledging suspicion due to naming. The security risk score is low (~0.2), consistent with static, benign data container. The confidence score is high (~0.8), as the analysis is based solely on static code review without external context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign, obfuscated data schema with no active malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malware or security risks. The current scores are appropriate, and further review should consider broader context if available.",
