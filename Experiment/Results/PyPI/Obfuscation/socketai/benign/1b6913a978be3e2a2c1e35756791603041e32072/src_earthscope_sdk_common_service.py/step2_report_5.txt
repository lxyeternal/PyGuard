  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Summary:** The code handles HTTP requests with error handling for 401 and 403, raising custom exceptions with response text.\n- **Obfuscation:** Present, making understanding difficult.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Assessment:** The logic appears standard for an SDK, with error handling based on status codes. Obfuscation is a concern but not indicative of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity evident.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, given the lack of malicious behavior.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, handling requests with retries, error handling, and obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** Present, but functionality appears legitimate.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity observed.\n- **Assessment:** Standard request handling with obfuscation, which could be for obfuscation's sake or concealment.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — consistent with low risk.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Summary:** Again, an async request handler with error management, obfuscated names.\n- **Obfuscation:** High, raising suspicion.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Assessment:** The obfuscation is notable, but the core logic remains standard request/response handling.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low, but with some caution due to obfuscation.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Summary:** Similar pattern, with obfuscated identifiers and error handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** Present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0.2 — slightly higher, possibly due to the pattern of obfuscation and custom exception handling.\n- **Assessment:** No direct malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and custom exception handling could be used to hide malicious intent.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.3 — slightly higher, reflecting increased suspicion but no concrete evidence.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Summary:** Same as above, standard request handling with obfuscation.\n- **Obfuscation:** Present.\n- **Malware Score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent with previous reports, obfuscation is the main concern.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 — low.\n\n---\n\n### Synthesis and Final Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation is suspicious but not definitive proof of malware.\n- **Obfuscated:** Consistently high (around 0.75-0.8), indicating deliberate code obfuscation.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low (0.2-0.3), but with some increase in report 4 due to the pattern of obfuscation and exception handling.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0 — no signs of malware or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — high obfuscation, which warrants caution.\n- **Security Risk:** 0.2 — low, but obfuscation can be used maliciously.\n\n### Final Notes:\n- The obfuscation alone does not prove malicious intent but raises suspicion.\n- The code's core logic appears standard for SDK request handling.\n- No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- The import of error classes and the use of custom exceptions are typical in SDKs but could be exploited to hide malicious code.\n\n**Conclusion:** The overall risk is low, but the high obfuscation warrants further review, especially if this code is part of a supply chain or critical infrastructure.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- **Malware Score:** 0.0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2\n\nProceed with caution, possibly requesting deobfuscation or source code review to ensure no malicious intent is hidden.",
