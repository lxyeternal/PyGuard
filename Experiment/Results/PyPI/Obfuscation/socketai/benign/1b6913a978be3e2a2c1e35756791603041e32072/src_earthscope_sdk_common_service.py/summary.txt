  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK request handler with high obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior is present. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could conceal malicious intent, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign. Malware score set to 0, obfuscation high (~0.8), and low risk (~0.2) are appropriate."
