{
  "purpose": "Handles HTTP request responses within an SDK, managing specific error statuses and raising custom exceptions accordingly.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from the HTTP response object 'StLmnQjGqzffDcpVLNbILYlXGRlhSifF' and the request object 'Request'.",
  "sinks": "Raises exceptions with response text upon certain status codes; potential leakage if response contains sensitive info.",
  "flows": "Request is sent via 'send' method; response flows through status code checks, leading to exception raising or normal return.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated class and variable names; import of error classes with nonsensical names; exception messages include response text, which could leak info.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard SDK request handling with error management for 401 and 403 status codes, raising custom exceptions. Obfuscation is significant, making understanding difficult, but no malicious actions such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors are evident. The error handling pattern could leak sensitive info but is common in SDKs. Malware score should be minimal due to lack of malicious activity; obfuscation is high, warranting caution. Overall, the code appears legitimate but warrants further review due to obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical SDK request handler with high obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior is present. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could conceal malicious intent, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign. Malware score set to 0, obfuscation high (~0.8), and low risk (~0.2) are appropriate.",
