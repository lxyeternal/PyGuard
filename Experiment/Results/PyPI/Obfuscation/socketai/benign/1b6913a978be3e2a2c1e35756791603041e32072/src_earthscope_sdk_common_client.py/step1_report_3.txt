  "purpose": "The code defines classes for managing SDK contexts and settings, supporting asynchronous and synchronous context management, and initializing context objects with optional parameters.",
  "sources": "Initialization of SDK context (`_ctx`) and optional settings (`SdkSettings`), import statements, property accessors, and context management methods.",
  "sinks": "Methods that invoke `close()` and `nFoYhcInyXVpNOmyypHLNzLVIKiMqXjM()` on the context, which could potentially be unsafe if these methods are malicious or perform unwanted actions. No explicit data sinks or network communication observed.",
  "flows": "Initialization flow from parameters to setting `_ctx`, property access to internal context attributes, and context manager methods calling `close()`.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated class and method names, dynamic importing within constructor, and the lack of clear documentation. The method `nFoYhcInyXVpNOmyypHLNzLVIKiMqXjM()` is called during cleanup without insight into its function, which could be suspicious. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns are immediately evident.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily manages SDK context objects with property accessors and context manager implementations. The obfuscated naming makes it difficult to ascertain the purpose of methods like `nFoYhcInyXVpNOmyypHLNzLVIKiMqXjM()`, which could potentially perform malicious actions during cleanup. The import of modules within constructor functions may be used to delay or obscure malicious behavior. However, no direct evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection is apparent. The code appears to be standard SDK boilerplate with obfuscation that warrants further review of imported methods.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult to determine intent. There are no explicit malicious patterns or security risks visible; however, the use of obscure method names and dynamic imports, along with calls to potentially undefined or hidden methods during cleanup, warrants caution. The code's primary function seems to be SDK context management, with no clear evidence of malicious activity but some potential for misuse depending on the behavior of called methods.",
