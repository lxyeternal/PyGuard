  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores, but reports 2 and 5 warrant higher suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features. Adjusting malware scores to 0.4–0.5 and obfuscation scores to 0.6–0.7 in these reports better reflects the potential risks. Overall, the code's security posture remains moderate, with no confirmed malicious activity but some indicators warranting caution."
