  "purpose": "Analyze the provided Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on the detailed reports.",
  "sources": "Code segments involving dynamic code execution (eval/exec), complex string manipulations, and potential obfuscation patterns.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted input handling, dynamic evaluation points, network communication functions, and file operations that could leak data or execute malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input parsing or environment variables flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to data leaks or malicious code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated code, dynamic eval/exec usage, complex string manipulations, and unclear logic patterns suggest suspicious activity, especially in reports 2 and 5.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits typical benign patterns in reports 1, 3, and 4, with low obfuscation and no malicious indicators. Reports 2 and 5 show signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, which are common in malicious or potentially malicious code. The scores for malware and obfuscation in these reports should be increased to better reflect the suspicion, with malware scores adjusted to 0.4–0.5 and obfuscation scores to 0.6–0.7 where appropriate. The overall security risk remains moderate, aligning with the suspicion level but lacking concrete malicious actions. The scores in the reports are mostly consistent with the described code features, but slight adjustments improve accuracy.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores, but reports 2 and 5 warrant higher suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features. Adjusting malware scores to 0.4–0.5 and obfuscation scores to 0.6–0.7 in these reports better reflects the potential risks. Overall, the code's security posture remains moderate, with no confirmed malicious activity but some indicators warranting caution.",
