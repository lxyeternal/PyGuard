  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the issues, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** The code manages SDK settings, authentication flows, and an async HTTP client. The sources are configuration and environment info, with dynamic imports and obfuscated names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Uses httpx.AsyncClient; no explicit network requests shown. The flow is configuration → client setup → potential network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated class/variable names, dynamic imports, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be SDK infrastructure with obfuscation but no malicious intent. The high obfuscation score (0.8) is justified; malware score (0) aligns with no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Confidence:** 0.7; **Risk:** 0.2 (low).\n\n**Assessment:** No issues confirmed, obfuscation noted but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK client with auth flows, HTTP request handling, dynamic imports, obfuscated names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTTP client creation, dynamic execution of async functions. The flow could be exploited if malicious code is injected into the functions executed.\n- **Anomalies:** Dynamic imports and obfuscated names, which could hide malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No explicit malicious activity, but the pattern of dynamic imports and obfuscation warrants caution. The malware score (0.1) is slightly elevated, possibly due to the potential for hiding malicious code, but no concrete evidence.\n- **Confidence:** 0.6; **Risk:** 0.4.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher risk due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution potential. Still, no direct malicious activity observed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Manages HTTP sessions, dependency injection, dynamic imports, obfuscated names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTTP client, dynamic wrapping of async functions.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, dynamic imports, but no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Functionally standard SDK component, with obfuscation possibly for concealment but no malicious behavior detected. Malware score is 0.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8; **Risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No issues, just obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for authentication and HTTP management, with dynamic imports and obfuscated names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTTP sessions, dynamic function wrapping.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscation, dynamic imports, but no malicious activity.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, obfuscation is a concern but not malicious.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9; **Risk:** 0.2.\n\n**Assessment:** No malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK setup, with configuration, dynamic imports, obfuscated names.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** HTTP headers, environment variables, auth flows.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscation, dynamic imports, no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK pattern, obfuscation could be to hide complexity but no malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8; **Risk:** 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no explicit malicious activity. Obfuscation and dynamic imports are present but not evidence of malware.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** Consistently high (~0.7-0.8), justified by variable and class names.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low (~0.2-0.4), as no direct vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are evident.\n\n### Final Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — no malware detected based on static analysis.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.75** — high obfuscation, but typical for SDKs or intentionally obscured code.\n- **Risk:** **0.2** — low, given no active malicious behavior, but obfuscation warrants cautious review.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be part of an SDK infrastructure with obfuscation possibly used to hinder static analysis. No evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or supply chain sabotage is present. The obfuscation should be monitored, but based on this static review, the overall security risk remains low.",
