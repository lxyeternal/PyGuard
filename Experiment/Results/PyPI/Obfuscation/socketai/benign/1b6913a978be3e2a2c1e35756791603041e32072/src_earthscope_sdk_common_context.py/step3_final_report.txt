  "purpose": "SDK infrastructure managing authentication flows, HTTP client setup, and configuration management.",
  "sources": "Configuration data, environment info, dynamic imports within property methods.",
  "sinks": "HTTPX AsyncClient for network communication, dynamic execution of async functions.",
  "flows": "Configuration and auth data flow into client setup, which can lead to network activity; dynamic imports may execute code at runtime.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, dynamic imports within properties, complex structure designed to hinder static analysis.",
  "analysis": "The code is part of an SDK that manages authentication flows and HTTP sessions, utilizing obfuscation and dynamic imports. No explicit malicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation and dynamic import patterns could be used to conceal malicious behavior, but static analysis shows no direct evidence. The code handles resource management appropriately and does not contain hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate SDK infrastructure with high obfuscation but no signs of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation warrants cautious review, but static analysis indicates a low security risk.",
