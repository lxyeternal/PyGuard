  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-checking the code, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes setup of SDK with auth flows and settings. Accurate based on code.\n- **Sinks:** Uses httpx.AsyncClient, but no explicit requests or data leaks are visible.\n- **Flows:** Configuration-driven, no untrusted data flow evident.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, dynamic imports, complex structure, but no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code appears to be SDK infrastructure for authenticated HTTP communication. Obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious. No data exfiltration or malicious network activity observed.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.2 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification for scores:** The high obfuscation score is justified; malware remains at zero due to lack of malicious indicators.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar SDK client with auth flows, dynamic imports, and configuration.\n- **Sinks:** HTTP client creation and execution of async functions—potential for misuse if malicious code is injected.\n- **Flows:** Data flows from config to network, with dynamic execution possible.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, dynamic imports, but no explicit malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Obfuscation and dynamic imports could hide malicious intent, but no direct malicious actions are visible. The code manages dependencies and resources appropriately.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0.1, Obfuscated 0.8, Risk 0.4 seem reasonable.\n- **Justification:** Slight increase in risk due to dynamic imports and obfuscation, but malware remains low.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for managing HTTP sessions, with dependency injection.\n- **Sinks:** HTTP client, dynamic function wrapping—potential for executing arbitrary code.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, dynamic imports, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The code is standard SDK infrastructure, with obfuscation possibly to hide complexity but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.6, Risk 0.2 seem appropriate.\n- **Justification:** Obfuscation is moderate; malware remains zero.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for authentication and HTTP request management.\n- **Sinks:** HTTP session, configuration data, potential network activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, dynamic imports, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate SDK code, no signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.2 are justified.\n- **Justification:** Obfuscation high, but no malware.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Purpose & Sources:** SDK for HTTP client with auth flows.\n- **Sinks:** Network headers, environment variables, internal methods.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated identifiers, dynamic imports, but no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Standard SDK pattern, obfuscation reduces transparency but not malicious.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Obfuscated 0.7, Risk 0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports have malware scores near zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious actions.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High (0.6-0.8), justified by the obfuscated class and variable names, dynamic imports, and complex structure.\n- **Risk Score:** Low (0.2-0.4), consistent with the lack of evidence for malicious activity but acknowledging the obfuscation.\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.75 — high obfuscation, possibly to hinder analysis.\n- **Risk:** 0.3 — moderate, mainly due to obfuscation, but no active threats.\n\n**Final notes:** The code appears to be SDK infrastructure code, with obfuscation possibly for intellectual property or anti-analysis reasons, but no signs of supply chain sabotage or malware. The scores assigned are reasonable, but I would slightly increase the obfuscated score to reflect the significant obfuscation and dynamic import patterns.\n\n**Overall conclusion:** No malicious activity detected; obfuscation is the primary concern warranting cautious review.",
