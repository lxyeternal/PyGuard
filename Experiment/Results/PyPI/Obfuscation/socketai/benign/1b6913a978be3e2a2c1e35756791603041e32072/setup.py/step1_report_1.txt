{
  "purpose": "The code is intended to set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data; it only imports a module and calls a function.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or points where untrusted data could be leaked or cause harm.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code simply executes setup().",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for a setup script, with no unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the 'setuptools' module and calls the 'setup()' function without parameters. This is a typical minimal setup script used in Python packaging. No external input, environment variables, or dynamic code execution is present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated code. It does not perform any network activity or system modification beyond package installation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
