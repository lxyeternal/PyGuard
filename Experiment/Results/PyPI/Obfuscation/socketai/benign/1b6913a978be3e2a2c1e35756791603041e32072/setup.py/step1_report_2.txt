  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "No explicit input or data reading sources in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs, no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only calls a setup function.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, straightforward call to setup() with no parameters; no suspicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setuptools library and executes setup() with default parameters. This is typical for Python package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious code execution. The code is minimal and standard for package distribution. No obfuscation, dynamic execution, or hidden functionalities are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard package setup script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
