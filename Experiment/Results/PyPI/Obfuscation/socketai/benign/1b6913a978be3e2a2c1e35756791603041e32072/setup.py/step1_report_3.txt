  "purpose": "This code is used to configure and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'setup' from setuptools, which reads the package configuration details during installation.",
  "sinks": "The 'setup()' function could potentially execute arbitrary configuration if misused, but in this minimal example, it is standard and does not perform data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "The 'setup()' call processes package metadata and configuration; there are no data flows involving untrusted inputs or outputs.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard; there are no anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the setup function from the setuptools library and calls it with default parameters. It is a typical minimal setup script. No inputs are processed, and no malicious or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard setup.py file used for package installation with no malicious intent or security issues detected.",
