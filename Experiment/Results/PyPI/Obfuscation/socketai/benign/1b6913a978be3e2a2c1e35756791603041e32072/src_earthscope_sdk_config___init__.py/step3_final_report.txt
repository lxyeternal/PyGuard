The reasoning is cautious and appropriate given the lack of data. Confidence scores are low, reflecting uncertainty due to missing code. No suspicious activity or obfuscation is indicated, and the assessments are consistent across reports.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are consistent and reasonable; no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation is present. Scores are appropriately low, and no further action is necessary.",
