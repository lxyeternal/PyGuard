  "purpose": "Define a version string and import specific classes from a third-party SDK module, then expose these classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string assignment, importing classes from 'earthscope_sdk.client'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data is written to files, network, or environment variables.",
  "flows": "No complex data flow observed; no untrusted data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Imported class names ('CPvrEEoTZWYQsRGhNiizaTkKRqVDuqtd', 'McGzCtQQSoedfbNzVbDfPLvhsRhzyUjN') are highly obfuscated, which could indicate malicious intent or concealment. The import statements are from a third-party SDK, which is not suspicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string with a suspiciously obfuscated value. It then imports two classes with non-descriptive, seemingly random names from 'earthscope_sdk.client'. The classes are then exposed via '__all__'. There are no functions, data processing, or network activities. The obfuscated class names are unusual and could be designed to hide malicious code or backdoors, but from the provided snippet, no malicious actions are directly evident. The code itself is minimal, and no dynamic execution or suspicious patterns are visible.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in its current form, primarily performing version declaration and imports. However, the obfuscated class names raise suspicion, as they may conceal malicious behavior or backdoors in the larger context. Based on this fragment alone, the risk level is low, but caution is advised if the imported classes are used elsewhere.",
