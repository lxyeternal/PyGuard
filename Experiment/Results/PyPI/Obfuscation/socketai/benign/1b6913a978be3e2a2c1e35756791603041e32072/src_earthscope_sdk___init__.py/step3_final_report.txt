{
  "purpose": "Minimal module setup assigning a version string and importing classes from an external SDK, with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version string to an obfuscated variable; import statements reading classes from 'earthscope_sdk.client'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks present; no network or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; code only performs static assignments and imports.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; __all__ references classes not defined or imported in this snippet; high obfuscation score justified.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, performing only a version assignment and imports with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic are evident. The obfuscation raises red flags but is not conclusive of malicious intent. The imported classes are not used within this fragment, and no network or data processing occurs. The scores reflect high obfuscation but low malware and security risk, consistent with the evidence.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in this fragment, with obfuscation as the primary red flag. No active malicious behavior is detected, but further review of the imported classes and their implementations is recommended before deployment or trust.",
