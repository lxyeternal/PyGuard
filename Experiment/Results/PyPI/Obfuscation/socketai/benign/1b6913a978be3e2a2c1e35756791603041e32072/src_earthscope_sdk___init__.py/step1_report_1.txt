  "purpose": "Define version and import specific classes from a package for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Reading the version string and importing classes from 'earthscope_sdk.client'.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security issues.",
  "flows": "Importing classes (CPvrEEoTZWYQsRGhNiizaTkKRqVDuqtd, McGzCtQQSoedfbNzVbDfPLvhsRhzyUjN) from a trusted module; no data flows to external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone is not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string and imports two classes from a module with non-descriptive names. No user input, network operations, or data processing present. The obfuscated names could indicate code minimization or obfuscation, but without malicious activity. The __all__ declaration is standard for controlling exports. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a minimal module setup with obfuscated class names, likely for modular use. There is no indication of malicious activity or security risks within this fragment.",
