{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a module that sets a version string and imports specific classes or functions from an external SDK, likely for EarthScope data handling.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment and the import statement from 'earthscope_sdk.client'.",
  "sinks": "The import statement could potentially bring in external code that may have malicious components, but in this context, it is a normal import.",
  "flows": "The code imports classes/functions from an external SDK; there are no untrusted data flows, user input, or data processing evident.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions for variables and imported components (e.g., 'igmjuBxqaLtKDmMiAabxeoRvMswxzWWq' and 'CPvrEEoTZWYQsRGhNiizaTkKRqVDuqtd') suggest obfuscated or intentionally obscure naming, which could be suspicious. However, no malicious activity is directly observable.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting of a version string and an import statement from an SDK. The variable name is obfuscated but does not by itself indicate malicious intent. Importing modules is standard; no suspicious code execution, hardcoded credentials, or data leaks are evident. The obfuscated variable names may be a concern, but without further context, this appears as either code obfuscation or non-standard naming practices rather than malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple module with obfuscated variable names and an import statement. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected based on this snippet alone. The obfuscated names could be a sign of code concealment but do not necessarily imply malicious intent.",
