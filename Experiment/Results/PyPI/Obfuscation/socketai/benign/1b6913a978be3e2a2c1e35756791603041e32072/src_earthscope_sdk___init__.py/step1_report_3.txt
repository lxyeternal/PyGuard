{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define a version string and import specific classes from an external SDK, then exports these classes for public use.",
  "sources": "The version string assignment, the import statement importing 'CPvrEEoTZWYQsRGhNiizaTkKRqVDuqtd' and 'McGzCtQQSoedfbNzVbDfPLvhsRhzyUjN' from 'earthscope_sdk.client'.",
  "sinks": "Imported classes 'CPvrEEoTZWYQsRGhNiizaTkKRqVDuqtd' and 'McGzCtQQSoedfbNzVbDfPLvhsRhzyUjN' are potentially used as sinks if instantiated or invoked elsewhere, but not inherently malicious here.",
  "flows": "The version string is static; the imported classes could be used downstream, but no direct data flow or execution path is visible within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported class names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual and potentially suspicious, suggesting obfuscation or concealment of intent.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string, imports two classes with obfuscated names from an SDK module, and defines an export list. The obfuscated class names are a red flag for potential concealment of malicious classes or functions. There is no evidence of malicious activity within this snippet, but the use of obscure identifiers warrants further review of the imported classes' implementations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to be part of a package setup or initial import statement. The obfuscated class names are suspicious and suggest further investigation is necessary to determine if these classes contain malicious behavior. No direct malicious activity or security risks are evident in this fragment alone.",
