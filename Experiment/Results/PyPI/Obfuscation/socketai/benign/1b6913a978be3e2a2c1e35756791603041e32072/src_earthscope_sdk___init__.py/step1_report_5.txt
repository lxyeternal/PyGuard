  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or execute untrusted code",
  "flows": "No complex data flow detected; straightforward imports and assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical variable name 'igmjuBxqaLtKDmMiAabxeoRvMswxzWWq' for version string; imported class names 'CPvrEEoTZWYQsRGhNiizaTkKRqVDuqtd' and 'McGzCtQQSoedfbNzVbDfPLvhsRhzyUjN' are obfuscated and appear to be randomly generated, which could be suspicious",
  "analysis": "The code sets a version string with a nonsensical variable name, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. It then imports two classes with highly obfuscated, non-descriptive names from a module. The '__all__' declaration exposes specific classes for external use. The obfuscated class names could be an attempt to hide malicious classes or functions, but without further context, this is not definitive. The code itself does not perform any malicious actions, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a minimal module setup with obfuscated class names and a nonsensical variable name for the version string. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and unusual naming could be a sign of attempts to hide malicious code or functionality.",
