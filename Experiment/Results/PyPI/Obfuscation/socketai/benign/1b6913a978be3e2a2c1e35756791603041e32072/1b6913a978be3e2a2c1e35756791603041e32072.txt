      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low malware and obfuscation scores, but reports 2 and 5 warrant higher suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic features. Adjusting malware scores to 0.4–0.5 and obfuscation scores to 0.6–0.7 in these reports better reflects the potential risks. Overall, the code's security posture remains moderate, with no confirmed malicious activity but some indicators warranting caution."

The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could conceal malicious intent, but based solely on this snippet, the code appears benign. Malware score set to 0, obfuscation high (~0.8), and low risk (~0.2) are appropriate."

No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The overall security risk is low, but obfuscation warrants cautious review before deployment in sensitive environments."

While the obfuscation and indirect method calls raise suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system compromise. The high obfuscation warrants further analysis, especially of the called methods, but based on static inspection, the code is likely benign with potential for misuse if malicious methods are present."

      "conclusion": "The code is likely a legitimate SDK for OAuth2 token handling, with obfuscation and hardcoded secrets raising caution. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or sabotage. The supply chain risk is low but warrants further review of the obfuscated import and secret management. The malware score is appropriate at 0.2, reflecting some suspicion due to obfuscation but no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation score of 0.7 is justified given the nonsensical import name and variable naming. The overall security risk score of 0.2 is consistent with the analysis."

There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal the code's purpose but does not imply malicious intent."
