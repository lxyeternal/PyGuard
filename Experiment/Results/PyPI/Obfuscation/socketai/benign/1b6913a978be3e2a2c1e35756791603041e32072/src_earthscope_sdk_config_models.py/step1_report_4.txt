{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define models, configurations, and utilities for an SDK related to earthscope.org, handling tokens, API configurations, and retry logic.",
  "sources": "Input sources include environment variables, secret strings, and API responses; notably, the decode function processes JWT tokens from secrets.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks involve token decoding, base64 decoding, and JSON validation, but no direct data exfiltration or system modification occurs.",
  "flows": "Input secrets are decoded and validated into structured models; token validation flows from secret extraction to JSON parsing; retry logic manages API call resilience.",
  "anomalies": "Use of base64 decoding on token parts, dynamic token validation, and complex retry logic are intricate but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or backdoors found.",
  "analysis": "The code structures models for token handling, API configuration, and retry policies. It includes decoding JWT tokens via base64 and JSON parsing, with validation ensuring at least one token type is present. Sensitive data like client secrets are managed with SecretStr and validation. The presence of functions that decode tokens and handle retries is typical for SDKs. No signs of data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage are evident. Use of complex class hierarchies and dynamic validation adds some complexity but doesn't suggest malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials (except a client_id string), backdoors, or suspicious network activity are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard SDK implementation for token management, API configuration, and retry policies. No malicious behavior, sabotage, or malware signals are detected. It is well-structured with no obvious security issues beyond typical SDK operations.",
