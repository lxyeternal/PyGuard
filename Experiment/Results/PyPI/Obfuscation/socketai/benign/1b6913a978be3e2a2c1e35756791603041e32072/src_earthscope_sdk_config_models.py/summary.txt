  "conclusion": "The code is likely a legitimate SDK for OAuth2 token handling, with obfuscation and hardcoded secrets raising caution. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or sabotage. The supply chain risk is low but warrants further review of the obfuscated import and secret management. The malware score is appropriate at 0.2, reflecting some suspicion due to obfuscation but no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation score of 0.7 is justified given the nonsensical import name and variable naming. The overall security risk score of 0.2 is consistent with the analysis."
