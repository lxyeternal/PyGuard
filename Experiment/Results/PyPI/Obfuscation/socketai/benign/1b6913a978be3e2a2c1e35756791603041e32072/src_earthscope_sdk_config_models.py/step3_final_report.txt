{
  "purpose": "This code manages OAuth2 token validation, SDK configuration, and token decoding, primarily for SDK setup and token handling.",
  "sources": "Import of 'earthscope_sdk.igmjuBxqaLtKDmMiAabxeoRvMswxzWWq', reading secret values from token strings, static assignment of client_id and domain.",
  "sinks": "Serialization of secrets in JSON, base64 decoding of JWT payloads, potential logging of secrets if misused.",
  "flows": "Source: import and secret retrieval; Sink: secret serialization and token decoding; Flow: import and secret handling during token validation.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import name, hardcoded client_id and domain URL, suppression of decoding errors, complex class hierarchies, base64 decoding of JWT payloads, nonsensical variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard SDK for OAuth2 token management, with typical token decoding and validation logic. The presence of an obfuscated import ('igmjuBxqaLtKDmMiAabxeoRvMswxzWWq') and hardcoded secrets (client_id, domain URL) are suspicious but do not directly indicate malicious activity. The suppression of decoding errors could hide issues but is not inherently malicious. The obfuscated variable names and import suggest an attempt to conceal details, but no network activity, payload execution, or sabotage is evident. The code's structure and logic align with legitimate SDK functions, with obfuscation and secrets being the main concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely a legitimate SDK for OAuth2 token handling, with obfuscation and hardcoded secrets raising caution. There is no evidence of malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or sabotage. The supply chain risk is low but warrants further review of the obfuscated import and secret management. The malware score is appropriate at 0.2, reflecting some suspicion due to obfuscation but no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation score of 0.7 is justified given the nonsensical import name and variable naming. The overall security risk score of 0.2 is consistent with the analysis.",
