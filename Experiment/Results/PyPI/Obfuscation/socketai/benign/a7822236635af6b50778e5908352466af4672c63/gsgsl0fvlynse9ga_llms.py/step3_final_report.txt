{
  "purpose": "The code provides documentation, usage instructions, and example snippets for integrating with the Together AI API, including API key handling via environment variables or init parameters.",
  "sources": "Reads input from environment variables (TOGETHER_API_KEY) and function parameters for API key configuration.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or system effects are present.",
  "flows": "Input from environment variables or parameters flows into API configuration; no malicious or suspicious data flows are detected.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward documentation and example snippets with no suspicious or malicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is purely documentation with example code snippets demonstrating API usage. It handles API keys via standard environment variables or parameters, with no embedded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious logic. No network requests or dynamic code execution are present. The code's benign nature is consistent across all reports, with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, non-malicious, and purely documentation-oriented. The malware score is correctly set to 0, obfuscation is absent, and the overall security risk is minimal (~0.1), mainly due to API key handling practices which are standard. No adjustments are necessary.",
