  "purpose": "Documentation and instructions for using the Together AI API, including setup, configuration, and usage examples for a Python client library.",
  "sources": "API key retrieval instructions, environment variable references, code snippets demonstrating usage, and docstring descriptions.",
  "sinks": "Potential injection points are minimal; environment variables and input parameters could be manipulated if used insecurely. No direct sinks for data leaks or malicious commands are present.",
  "flows": "Input prompt and API key sources flow into the API client initialization, which then makes requests to the external API. No direct data flow from untrusted sources to sinks within this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; no hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscated code detected. The code is standard documentation and usage examples.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily descriptive documentation and example code for using the API. It references environment variables and API parameters. No actual logic, data processing, or executable code is present that could be malicious. No signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads are identified. The code's structure and content are typical for API usage documentation.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign documentation snippet and usage example code with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It provides guidance on API key management and usage but does not contain executable logic that could be exploited.",
