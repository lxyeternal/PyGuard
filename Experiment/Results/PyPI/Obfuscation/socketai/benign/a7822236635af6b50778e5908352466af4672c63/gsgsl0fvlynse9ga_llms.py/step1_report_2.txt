  "purpose": "The code provides instructions and documentation for using the Together AI API via a Python library, including how to set API keys, configure parameters, and generate text responses.",
  "sources": "API key from environment variable `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, and parameters passed to the Together class/methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data such as API keys and prompt inputs; output responses from the API.",
  "flows": "Environment variable `TOGETHER_API_KEY` (source) flows into the API initialization; user input prompts flow into the model; model outputs are returned as generated strings.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (apart from documentation hints), or suspicious behavior detected. The code is primarily descriptive and interface-oriented.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of documentation and sample code for API usage, including setting API keys via environment variables or init parameters, and parameters for text generation. No code performs network operations or data processing beyond calling the API. No obfuscated or malicious logic observed. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious commands present. It appears to be standard API client documentation with typical parameter handling.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a standard API usage documentation with example code snippets and parameter descriptions. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The code primarily facilitates API interaction and configuration.",
