  "purpose": "Documentation and example code for using the Together AI API with a Python client library.",
  "sources": "API key retrieval from environment variable `TOGETHER_API_KEY`, user-provided API key parameter, and documentation links.",
  "sinks": "Potential API key leakage if environment variables or parameters are improperly exposed or logged; no direct sinks for untrusted data observed.",
  "flows": "API key from environment variable or init parameter → API usage in client library; no untrusted data flows or external network calls within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets other than documentation references; no backdoors, malicious code, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily documentation and example usage instructions for a Python client library. It mentions reading an API key from an environment variable or parameter, which is standard. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code are evident. The focus is on API configuration and usage, with no suspicious operations or code injection points.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is a benign documentation/example code for API integration. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are identified. It correctly references environment variables and parameters without exposing sensitive data. Overall, it appears safe.",
