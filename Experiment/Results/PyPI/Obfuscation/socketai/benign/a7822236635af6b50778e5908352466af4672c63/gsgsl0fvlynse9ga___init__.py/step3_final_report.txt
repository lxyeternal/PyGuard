  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, environment variables, files, network interfaces, subprocess calls.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, subprocess executions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious dynamic code execution, no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign, with no signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The confidence in benign nature is high given the absence of suspicious patterns. Minimal or no code limits certainty, but no indicators of sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency code shows no malicious intent or security risks based on the provided analysis. Scores are consistent with the benign assessment, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0, and a low security risk score of 0.2 justified by limited context.",
