  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OCI image handling utility with significant obfuscation. There is no concrete evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review. The malware risk is low, and the overall security risk remains moderate due to the obfuscation and complexity, but no active malicious actions are detected."
