  "purpose": "Descriptive documentation outlining the process of merging OCI and Docker artifacts, including validation and handling different artifact types.",
  "sources": "No actual data input sources; the code is a comment or documentation string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or untrusted data handling occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no executable code or data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Typos ('if if'), placeholder or nonsensical variable names ('nOCqACdCLduVMPkugJhUsLYEaGXiRSVK'), indicating poor quality or placeholders, but no malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippets are purely descriptive comments or documentation about merging OCI artifacts, with no executable logic, network activity, or data handling. The typos and placeholder variable names suggest poor documentation or incomplete snippets rather than obfuscation or malicious code. No signs of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The minimal anomalies are typographical and do not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk≈0.1, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the benign nature of the content.",
  "conclusion": "The code is non-executable documentation with minor typographical issues and placeholder names. There is no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and risk scores are justified and should remain unchanged.",
