{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a descriptive comment or documentation outlining the process of merging OCI artifacts into an OCI Image Index, without actual executable logic.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reads are evident in this snippet; it is a descriptive explanation.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present, as this is only a comment or documentation string.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths are present, since no executable code exists here.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely descriptive and contains no executable or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs are evident.",
  "analysis": "This fragment is a textual description, likely part of documentation or a docstring, explaining how OCI artifacts are merged. It discusses artifact types, source and target considerations, and error handling for inconsistent sources. There are no signs of obfuscation, malicious code, or security issues. The absence of executable code minimizes the risk profile. It does not perform any data processing, network operations, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is non-executable documentation describing the merging of OCI artifacts. It poses no security threats, malware, or malicious intent, and contains no suspicious or anomalous code. It is safe to consider this as informational text only.",
