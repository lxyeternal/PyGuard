  "purpose": "To sanitize and normalize OCI registry configuration blobs, returning the original if already 'sane' or a sanitized version otherwise.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'cfg-blob' being checked for 'sane' status and potentially processed for sanitization.",
  "sinks": "Return statement providing either the original 'cfg-blob' or the sanitized UTF-8 encoded bytes.",
  "flows": "Input 'cfg-blob' -> check 'sane' -> if not, sanitize -> encode as UTF-8 bytes -> return.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or covert data flows detected; description-only, no code snippets provided.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward check on 'cfg-blob' to determine if it is 'sane'. If so, it returns the input unchanged; otherwise, it sanitizes the data and encodes it as UTF-8 bytes. No malicious behaviors, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation are indicated. The process appears to be a benign utility for configuration normalization. Given the absence of implementation details, the analysis relies on the description, which aligns with standard sanitization routines. The scores assigned across reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.1-0.2) are consistent with a benign, low-risk utility.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign sanitization utility for OCI registry configuration blobs. No evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks is present. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the description. No adjustments are necessary.",
