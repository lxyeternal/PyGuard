  "purpose": "Provide a sanitized version of a configuration blob related to OCI registries, ensuring the output is safe and consistent.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'cfg-blob', which is the configuration data passed into the function.",
  "sinks": "Return value which outputs the sanitized configuration data, possibly as a utf-8-encoded bytes object.",
  "flows": "Input 'cfg-blob' is processed; if deemed 'sane', returned directly; otherwise, it is sanitized and returned as utf-8 bytes.",
  "anomalies": "No code present to review; only descriptive comments provided. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided text describes a function that processes a configuration blob, returning either the original or a sanitized version. There is no code logic shown, only a description of behavior. Based on this, no malicious code patterns, data leaks, or suspicious activities are detected. The process appears to be straightforward sanitization logic without any evident malicious behavior or security flaws.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for sanitizing configuration data for OCI registries. No malicious intent or security risks are identified based on the provided description.",
