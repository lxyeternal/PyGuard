  "purpose": "Documentation and description of OCI image handling, including serialization, deserialization, and image reference normalization.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; primarily static comments and documentation strings referencing external schemas and specifications.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output functions that handle untrusted data identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths involving untrusted data; mainly descriptive comments and references.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns; code appears to be documentation and class description comments.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a detailed comment block describing functionality related to OCI image references, manifests, and schemas. It references external specifications and repositories but contains no executable code, input handling, or data processing logic. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious behavior, or security risks. The comments serve as documentation for a class or module intended for internal use, not directly executable or exploitable.",
  "conclusion": "This code is purely descriptive documentation without executable content, input handling, or data sinks. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation detected. It appears to be safe and intended for development reference.",
