  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to untrusted data handling, network activity, and obfuscation. The scores reflect this suspicion appropriately. Other analyzed code snippets are benign with low risk. Further investigation is recommended for code exhibiting these behaviors before deployment."
