  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code patterns, data flows, and anomalies.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, subprocess calls, network requests, hardcoded URLs or credentials, dynamic code execution points.",
  "sinks": "System commands, network endpoints, file operations, environment variables, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Untrusted input or environment data flowing into subprocess commands, network requests, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded URLs, command strings, dynamic execution (eval/exec), obfuscation, suspicious network activity, untrusted data reaching system commands.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits behaviors such as untrusted data being passed into subprocess calls and network requests, with some obfuscation suspected. These patterns suggest potential command injection and data exfiltration. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are explicitly confirmed, but the suspicious patterns justify a moderate malware suspicion. The benign patterns in other code snippets show standard utility functions with no malicious indicators. The overall structure and behavior support a malware score of approximately 0.4, obfuscation score of 0.2, and security risk of 0.6, aligning with the suspicion level. The confidence in these assessments is high (0.75), given the behavioral clues, but not absolute without code confirmation.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate suspicion of malicious activity, primarily due to untrusted data handling, network activity, and obfuscation. The scores reflect this suspicion appropriately. Other analyzed code snippets are benign with low risk. Further investigation is recommended for code exhibiting these behaviors before deployment.",
