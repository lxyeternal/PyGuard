  "purpose": "Define classes and utilities for handling legacy OCI images and Docker configurations.",
  "sources": "No specific input or data sources identified; static code definitions and comments only.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling, no data outputs, no external communications or insecure operations detected.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static code with class and utility definitions, no source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns. Comments refer to legacy systems, but no malicious intent evident.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a simple set of class definitions and utility functions related to OCI images and Docker configurations. There are no active data processing, network operations, or external data inputs/outputs. The mention of legacy images and configurations does not indicate malicious behavior but suggests compatibility handling. The code structure is minimal and does not contain obfuscated code, secret leaks, or suspicious operations.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be straightforward utility and model class definitions for managing legacy Docker OCI images, with no suspicious or harmful components.",
