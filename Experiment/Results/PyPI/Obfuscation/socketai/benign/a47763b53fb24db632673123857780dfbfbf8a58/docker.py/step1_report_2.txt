{
  "purpose": "Defines model classes and utility functions for handling legacy OCI images from an older Docker version.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources such as user input, environment variables, or external data files are present.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network calls, file writes, or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows identified within the provided code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "The comment mentions a configuration string that appears to be a key or identifier ('use as cfg in oci-nOCqACdCLduVMPkugJhUsLYEaGXiRSVK'), which could be a hardcoded secret or token, but no explicit usage is shown.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is primarily descriptive, outlining the purpose of classes and utils for legacy OCI image handling. There are no active code blocks, data processing, or logic demonstrated that could be analyzed for malicious intent. The mention of a configuration string may suggest some hardcoded data, but without actual code or data handling, it is not possible to determine malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided snippet, there is no evidence of malicious code or suspicious activity. The code appears to be a straightforward setup for handling legacy OCI images. The only concern is a possibly hardcoded configuration string, but without further code context, this cannot be definitively malicious.",
