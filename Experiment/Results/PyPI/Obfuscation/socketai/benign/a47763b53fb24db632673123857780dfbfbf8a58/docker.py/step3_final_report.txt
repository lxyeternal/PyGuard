{
  "purpose": "Review open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks, focusing on code content, data flow, and suspicious patterns.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, utility functions, configuration strings, comments indicating handling of OCI images and Docker configs.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present; code is purely descriptive with no active data handling.",
  "flows": "No active data flow from sources to sinks; code contains only static class and comment definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated string ('oci-nOCqACdCLduVMPkugJhUsLYEaGXiRSVK') mentioned in comments but not used maliciously; no secrets or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet consists solely of class definitions and utility comments related to OCI images, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity. The mention of an obfuscated string appears only in comments and does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns. Risk scores are slightly elevated in some reports due to mention of configuration strings, but without concrete evidence of secrets or malicious code, these scores should be very low. Malware scores are appropriately zero, and obfuscation scores are zero across all reports. Confidence levels are high, reflecting the lack of active or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risks. The scores are consistent with the evidence, and no further action is necessary. The overall security posture based on these snippets is very low risk.",
