  "purpose": "Defines model classes and utility functions for handling legacy OCI images based on Docker configuration files.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources in the provided code snippet.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks such as data transmission, file writing, or execution points are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks identified due to the lack of detailed code.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code provided; no suspicious or unusual code patterns observed. The description suggests handling Docker and OCI images, which is standard in container management.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet appears to define classes and utilities for working with legacy OCI images and Docker configs. It does not include any network operations, data handling, or execution points that could be malicious. The code is descriptive and technical without signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious intent. The minimal context limits deeper analysis, but based on the provided fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility setup for managing legacy OCI images and Docker configurations, with no malicious intent or security concerns evident from the provided snippet.",
