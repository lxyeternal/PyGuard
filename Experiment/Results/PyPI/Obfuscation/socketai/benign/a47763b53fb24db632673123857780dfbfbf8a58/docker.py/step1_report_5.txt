  "purpose": "Define model classes and utilities for handling legacy OCI images from an older Docker version.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources like files, network, or environment variables detected.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive actions identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to contain only class definitions and utility functions related to OCI image handling. It lacks input handling, network operations, or code execution. The comments suggest its purpose is to manage legacy Docker OCI images, but there are no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security risks. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears to be straightforward model and utility classes for managing legacy OCI images, with no indications of malicious intent or security issues.",
