{
  "purpose": "This code defines utility functions for configuring Python loggers with specified formats, handlers, and levels.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from parameters such as 'file_name', 'log_level', and 'logger_name'.",
  "sinks": "Logging handlers write data to stdout or a specified file; no untrusted data is directly sent elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence logger configuration, setting levels and handlers; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated, but code structure is typical for logger setup. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code are present. No dynamic code execution or external network connections are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to create logging handlers for stdout and files, and a main function to configure a logger with optional level and handlers. Level validation prevents misconfiguration. No malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or backdoors are detected. Variable obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal intent but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code serves a benign purpose related to logging setup.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard logging setup utility with obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It properly manages logger configuration without executing any harmful actions or exposing sensitive data.",
