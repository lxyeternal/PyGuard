{
  "purpose": "Retrieve the package version and import a class/object from an external package, likely for static analysis or linting purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module's own version via importlib.metadata.version(__name__) and imports NZwMgKodjRlFzsKZJaWmfgqeoRVXzUQq from flake8_force_keyword_arguments.checker.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external inputs are processed; no sinks are present in this minimal code snippet.",
  "flows": "The version information is retrieved from the package metadata; the imported class/object is loaded but not used or executed, so no data flows from source to sink.",
  "anomalies": "The import name NZwMgKodjRlFzsKZJaWmfgqeoRVXzUQq appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard operations: setting a version string and importing a class/object. The import name's obfuscation raises suspicion but lacks evidence of malicious intent. No code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. The minimal structure and known package suggest benign static analysis or linting use. The scores across reports are consistent: malware score at 0, obfuscated score around 0.6, and low security risk (~0.2). The suspicion is primarily due to the obfuscated import name, but without further context, it remains a potential concern rather than confirmed malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing routine version retrieval and import. The obfuscated import name is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. The current security assessment should assign a malware score of 0, an obfuscated score around 0.6, and a low risk score (~0.2). Further investigation should focus on the origin and usage of the imported class/object if more code is available.",
