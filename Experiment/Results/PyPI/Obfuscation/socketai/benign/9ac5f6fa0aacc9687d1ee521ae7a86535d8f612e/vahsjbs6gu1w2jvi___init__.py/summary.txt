  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing routine version retrieval and import. The obfuscated import name is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. The current security assessment should assign a malware score of 0, an obfuscated score around 0.6, and a low risk score (~0.2). Further investigation should focus on the origin and usage of the imported class/object if more code is available."
