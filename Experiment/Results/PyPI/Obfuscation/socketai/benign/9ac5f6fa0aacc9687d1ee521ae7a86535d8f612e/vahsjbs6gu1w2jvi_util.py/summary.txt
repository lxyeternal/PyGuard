  "malware_score": 0.1,
  "security_risk": 0.2,
  "obfuscated": 0.6,
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for module and function introspection, with obfuscation and dynamic features that could be misused but do not indicate malicious activity. The scores are appropriate; the overall security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to potential misuse rather than active malicious behavior."
