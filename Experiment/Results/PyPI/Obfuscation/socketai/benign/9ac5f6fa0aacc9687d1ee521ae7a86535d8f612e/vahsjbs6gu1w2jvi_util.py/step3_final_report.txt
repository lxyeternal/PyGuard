  "purpose": "Utility functions for inspecting modules, classes, functions, and AST nodes, primarily for dynamic or static code analysis.",
  "sources": "Module objects, class or function objects, AST nodes, object attributes, and module/member introspection via inspect.getmembers.",
  "sinks": "Generated attribute or module path strings, recursive module traversal, signature inspection, and attribute access.",
  "flows": "Input objects (modules, classes, functions) are inspected for members, signatures, and attributes; relevant strings are yielded based on conditions; recursive calls traverse nested modules or objects.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, extensive use of dynamic attribute access and inspection, recursive traversal, potential for misuse but no explicit malicious payloads or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs recursive module and member inspection, signature analysis, and string generation for module attributes. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration are evident. Obfuscation is notable but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. The dynamic inspection capabilities could be exploited in malicious contexts, but the code itself remains benign. The scores assigned in the reports—malware near zero, moderate obfuscation, and low to moderate risk—are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for module and function introspection, with obfuscation and dynamic features that could be misused but do not indicate malicious activity. The scores are appropriate; the overall security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to potential misuse rather than active malicious behavior.",
