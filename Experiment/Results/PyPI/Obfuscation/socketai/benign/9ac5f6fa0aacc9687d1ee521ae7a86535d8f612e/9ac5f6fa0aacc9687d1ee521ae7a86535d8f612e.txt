      "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing routine version retrieval and import. The obfuscated import name is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. The current security assessment should assign a malware score of 0, an obfuscated score around 0.6, and a low risk score (~0.2). Further investigation should focus on the origin and usage of the imported class/object if more code is available."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for module and function introspection, with obfuscation and dynamic features that could be misused but do not indicate malicious activity. The scores are appropriate; the overall security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to potential misuse rather than active malicious behavior."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility aimed at enforcing argument passing conventions. It contains superficial obfuscation and dynamic module import capabilities but shows no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to dynamic imports, which are standard in configurable tools. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is approximately 0.7, and security risk score is around 0.2, reflecting the superficial obfuscation and controlled environment assumptions."
