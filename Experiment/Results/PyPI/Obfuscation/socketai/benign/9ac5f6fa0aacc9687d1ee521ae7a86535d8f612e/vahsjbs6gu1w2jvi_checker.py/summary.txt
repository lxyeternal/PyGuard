  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility aimed at enforcing argument passing conventions. It contains superficial obfuscation and dynamic module import capabilities but shows no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to dynamic imports, which are standard in configurable tools. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is approximately 0.7, and security risk score is around 0.2, reflecting the superficial obfuscation and controlled environment assumptions."
