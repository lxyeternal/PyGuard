  "purpose": "Static analysis utility for enforcing argument style conventions in Python functions, inspecting ASTs for call patterns and applying configurable ignore patterns and module inspections.",
  "sources": "AST nodes representing function calls, configuration options via command-line arguments, external modules for pattern management and module inspection.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks; the code performs AST traversal and pattern matching without network or file system modifications.",
  "flows": "AST traversal sources (function call nodes) to pattern matching filters, leading to reporting of calls with excessive positional arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable names, use of dynamic module import (`importlib.import_module`) with configurable module names, complex regex patterns for ignore lists, superficial obfuscation not indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static analysis tool designed to enforce the use of keyword arguments in function calls, configurable via command-line options. It traverses the AST to identify calls with more positional arguments than allowed, filters out ignored patterns, and inspects specified modules for positional-only callables. Obfuscated variable names are present but typical in minimized or generated code, not malicious. The use of dynamic imports is standard in plugin-based tools but could pose risks if inputs are untrusted; however, in controlled environments, this is acceptable. No external system interaction, network activity, or malicious code is detected. The code's purpose is purely static analysis, with no data exfiltration or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate static analysis utility aimed at enforcing argument passing conventions. It contains superficial obfuscation and dynamic module import capabilities but shows no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to dynamic imports, which are standard in configurable tools. The overall malware score is 0, obfuscation score is approximately 0.7, and security risk score is around 0.2, reflecting the superficial obfuscation and controlled environment assumptions.",
