      "conclusion": "This code is highly suspicious and potentially malicious, executing an untrusted package installation from an obfuscated URL without validation. It poses a significant supply chain security risk, capable of remote code execution or malware infection. The current scores are appropriate but could be slightly increased to reflect the high threat level."
