{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files, extracting package requirements, and package metadata variables.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data is written or executed in a way that affects system security.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file reads ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt') into variables used for package setup; no external or untrusted data flows into executable code or system commands.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, no clear malicious activity. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or dynamic code execution. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present.",
  "analysis": "The script imports setup tools and reads package metadata from files with obfuscated variable names. It filters and processes requirements, then calls setup() with package information. There is no suspicious code, obfuscated logic, or malicious behavior. All operations are standard for Python packaging scripts. The obfuscated variable names do not indicate malicious intent but could hinder readability.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical package setup script with obfuscated variable names, which do not appear malicious. No signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are detected. It appears to be a benign package configuration script.",
