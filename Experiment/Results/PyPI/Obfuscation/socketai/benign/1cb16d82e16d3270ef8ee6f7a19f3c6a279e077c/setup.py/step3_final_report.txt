{
  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script that reads README and requirements files, processes dependencies, and invokes setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files; processes dependencies; no external input beyond files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, code execution, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Reads files into variables; passes static metadata to setup(); no dynamic or external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, inconsistent formatting, but no malicious code or suspicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The code functions as a benign setup script with obfuscated variable names. No network activity, code execution, or malicious behavior detected. Obfuscation is superficial, likely stylistic. Dependency processing is straightforward. No hardcoded secrets or backdoors present. The scores assigned in reports (malware=0, obfuscated ~0.7, risk=0.1) are consistent with the code's behavior and obfuscation level.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is present. The current scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
