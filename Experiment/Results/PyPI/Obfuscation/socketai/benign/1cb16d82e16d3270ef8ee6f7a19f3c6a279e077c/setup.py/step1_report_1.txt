{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package using setuptools, reading dependencies, and configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' and 'requirements.txt' files, and defining package setup parameters.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data processing or external data transmission; setup configuration is static.",
  "flows": "Reading files into variables, then passing these variables into the setup() function to configure package metadata.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, inconsistent formatting, and string concatenations that seem unnecessary. No actual malicious code or suspicious network activities present.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily reads local files ('README.md' and 'requirements.txt'), processes their contents, and uses them to configure a package via setup(). The obfuscated variable names and formatting irregularities are suspicious but do not indicate malicious intent. No code execution, external communications, or data exfiltration observed. The code performs a standard package setup with no malicious behavior or malware signatures.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical package setup script with obfuscated variable names and formatting irregularities. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is likely a benign setup script with some obfuscation style that does not impact security.",
