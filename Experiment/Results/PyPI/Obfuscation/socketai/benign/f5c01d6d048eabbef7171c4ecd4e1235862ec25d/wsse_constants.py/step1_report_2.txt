{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define several namespace URIs related to XML security, SOAP, and WS-Security standards, likely for use in constructing or processing secure SOAP messages.",
  "sources": "String assignments defining namespace URIs and concatenations forming file paths or schema locations.",
  "sinks": "No clear data sinks are present; the code does not perform data output, network communication, or file writing.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment operations; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The code consists solely of string variable assignments with static URLs; no obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded credentials, or suspicious logic detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only assigns fixed string values representing URLs for XML namespaces and schema locations used in WS-Security and SOAP message processing. These are standard namespace URLs and do not suggest malicious behavior. There are no inputs, outputs, or complex control flows. The concatenations appear to be part of standard configuration or setup.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign, defining namespace URIs for XML security standards.",
