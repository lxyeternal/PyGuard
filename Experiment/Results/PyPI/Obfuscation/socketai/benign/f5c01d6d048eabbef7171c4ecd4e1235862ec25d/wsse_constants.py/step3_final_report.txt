  "purpose": "Define static URL strings for XML namespaces related to SOAP, XML Digital Signature, XML Encryption, and WS-Security standards, used for configuration in XML security processing.",
  "sources": "Assignment of string variables with namespace URLs, some concatenated to form full URLs.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or data flows, serving solely as configuration constants.",
  "flows": "N/A; static string assignments without data flow or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static URL definitions with no obfuscation, secrets, or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of static string variables defining namespace URLs for XML security standards. There is no dynamic behavior, input/output, network activity, or obfuscation. The code is typical configuration data used in XML/SOAP security contexts. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware, obfuscation, and security risk scores of 0. The reasoning is consistent, and the scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely configuration for XML security namespaces with no malicious, obfuscated, or risky behavior. All reports are accurate, and no score adjustments are necessary.",
