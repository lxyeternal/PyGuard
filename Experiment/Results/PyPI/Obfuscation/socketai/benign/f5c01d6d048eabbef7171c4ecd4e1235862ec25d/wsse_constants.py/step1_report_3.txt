  "purpose": "Defines namespace URIs for SOAP, XML Signature, XML Encryption, and WS-Security profiles used in XML-based security and messaging protocols.",
  "sources": "String assignments that set namespace URIs for various XML security standards.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only assigns string constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns namespace URIs related to XML security standards such as SOAP, XML Digital Signature, XML Encryption, and WS-Security. All variables are static string constants used for defining namespaces in XML documents. There are no input/output operations, no use of untrusted data, and no dynamic code execution or suspicious behavior. The code appears to be configuration or setup data used in larger XML processing or security context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward assignment of namespace URIs used for XML security protocols. There is no malicious behavior, suspicious activity, or security risk detected. It appears to be part of a larger XML security implementation, not malicious or harmful.",
