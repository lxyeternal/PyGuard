  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script, possibly intended for data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from user inputs, environment variables, or external files read within the script.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, or system commands executed with data from sources.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks potentially via variables or function calls that handle untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code obfuscation, or backdoors detected. The code uses standard libraries and practices.",
  "analysis": "The script's structure shows standard function definitions, data handling, and possibly network or file operations. No unusual code constructs or obfuscation are present. The use of environment variables and file I/O appears typical. No malicious intent such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage is evident. The code's behavior is consistent with typical utility scripts, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the provided content. It appears to be a benign, standard Python script without supply chain threats.",
