  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a specific data processing task, possibly involving network communication or local data handling, but no explicit purpose is clearly identified.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from user input, environment variables, or network sources, depending on functions invoked within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or data output functions, which could be used to exfiltrate data or cause side effects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, potentially untrusted inputs reaching sensitive operations like network or file I/O.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. Usage of dynamic code execution or unusual language features is not apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines functions without any visible malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network calls are evident. The structure appears typical for a utility script. Without explicit input/output handling or network activity, suspicious behavior is not apparent. The absence of obfuscated code and benign function definitions suggests no malicious behavior. However, full context is needed for definitive assessment.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears standard and non-malicious, with no evidence of malware or security threats. Slight uncertainty remains due to lack of complete context, but overall assessment is low risk.",
