  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks based on code analysis.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, environment variables, network connections, file reads, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, environment variable access, data leaks, system modifications.",
  "flows": "From data input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unusual dynamic execution, hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "All provided reports indicate benign, straightforward code with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious activity. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscated scores are zero, and security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), aligning with the benign descriptions. No evidence of malicious intent or sabotage is present. The absence of code in report 4 limits analysis, but the assessments are appropriate given the context. The confidence levels are high where code is reviewed, and the scores are consistent with the findings.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign, with no signs of malware or obfuscation. The low security risk scores are justified. All reports accurately reflect the benign nature, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
