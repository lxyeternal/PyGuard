  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python package module, likely intended for general functionality within a larger project, with no explicit indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; no user input, environment variable reads, or external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "No critical sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are identified; the code executes internally without external data influence.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual code constructs are present. The code structure is straightforward and adheres to standard Python practices.",
  "analysis": "A detailed review shows the code functions normally, importing common libraries and defining standard functions or classes. No suspicious patterns such as dynamic execution, hidden backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The code does not interact with external systems or perform operations that could compromise security.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious activity or malware signatures.",
