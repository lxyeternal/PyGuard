{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be a Python package, possibly designed for general functionality or as a utility library.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly present; the code reads environment variables and possibly external data through imported modules, but no direct user input or external data sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, subprocess calls, or file operations if present, but none are explicitly identified in the code. No direct data leakage points are observed.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows indicating malicious data exfiltration or manipulation pathways.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or unusual code structures are evident. The code appears to follow standard Python patterns without obfuscation or uncommon language features.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, utilizing standard Python libraries and practices. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are detected. It does not perform any network operations, data collection, or system modifications beyond normal library functions. The absence of obfuscation, dynamic code execution, or hidden behaviors suggests the code is benign. The lack of input/output operations, especially with untrusted data, indicates low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears safe, with no signs of malware, sabotage, or security flaws.",
