  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading README and CHANGES files; reading __init__.py for version information.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or could lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "Reads files for metadata and version; no data flows from untrusted sources to critical functions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; unusual formatting; no clear malicious code or backdoors. Version extraction from __init__.py appears normal.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard setup operations: reading documentation files, extracting version info from __init__.py, and defining dependencies. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated but do not correlate with malicious behavior. No code injection, data exfiltration, or suspicious network activity is present. The setup configuration aligns with typical packaging scripts, and dependencies are standard Python packages. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to obscure the code but does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic are found.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided content. The obfuscation seems superficial and does not suggest malicious intent.",
