      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard cryptographic message processing with obfuscation that raises suspicion but lacks concrete evidence of malicious behavior. The malware score is set low, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscation justifies a high obfuscated score. The moderate security risk reflects the uncertainty due to obfuscation and cryptographic handling. Further investigation of external functions is recommended before deploying or trusting this code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated class declaration with no active malicious behavior or security issues. The high obfuscation score is justified, and malware risk remains zero. Overall, the code poses minimal security threat, but obfuscation suggests a need for cautious review in broader contexts."

The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware is unlikely, obfuscation is superficial, and overall security risk is low."

The obfuscation is noted but does not indicate malicious intent. Scores should remain at malware 0, obfuscated approximately 0.6, and security risk around 0.1."

The malware score should be set to 0, and the security risk remains low. Continued review in the broader context is recommended."
