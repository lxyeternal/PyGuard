  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility for XML encryption and token management. While obfuscation is significant and warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage within this fragment. The malware score should be set to 0, and the security risk remains low. Continued review in the broader context is recommended."
