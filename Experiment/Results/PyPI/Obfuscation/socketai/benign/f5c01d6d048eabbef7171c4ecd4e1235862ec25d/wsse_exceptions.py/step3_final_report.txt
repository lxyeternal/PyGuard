{
  "purpose": "To evaluate the supply chain security and malicious potential of the provided Python class code, focusing on obfuscation, malicious behavior, and security risks.",
  "sources": "The class declaration itself; no external data inputs, outputs, or data flows are present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform operations that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are identifiable; the code is a simple class declaration with no operational logic.",
  "anomalies": "The class name is obfuscated or nonsensical, which could be used to conceal intent but is not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with an obfuscated name, containing no methods or logic. All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code, noting the obfuscation but finding no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious behavior. Obfuscation scores are high (around 0.7-0.8), justified by the class name's nature. Security risk scores are very low (0-0.1), reflecting the code's simplicity and lack of operational impact. The reasoning across reports is consistent, cautious, and appropriate, with no logical flaws. The obfuscation warrants attention if part of a larger suspicious codebase but is not sufficient alone to indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated class declaration with no active malicious behavior or security issues. The high obfuscation score is justified, and malware risk remains zero. Overall, the code poses minimal security threat, but obfuscation suggests a need for cautious review in broader contexts.",
