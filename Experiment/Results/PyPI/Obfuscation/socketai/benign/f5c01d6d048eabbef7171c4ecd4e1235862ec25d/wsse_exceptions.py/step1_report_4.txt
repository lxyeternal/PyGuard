  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named yxUgKRkwAjePBTsPVQjhGsAGTAqoLIoL.",
  "sources": "Class declaration, no input or data reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or sensitive operations, no sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or intentionally complex; no other unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of a single class declaration inheriting from Exception. The class name is complex and likely obfuscated but does not indicate malicious intent by itself. No input handling, no data leakage, and no suspicious operations are present. Given its simplicity, the code appears to serve as a custom exception class, possibly part of a larger codebase. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines an obfuscated but benign custom exception class with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues.",
