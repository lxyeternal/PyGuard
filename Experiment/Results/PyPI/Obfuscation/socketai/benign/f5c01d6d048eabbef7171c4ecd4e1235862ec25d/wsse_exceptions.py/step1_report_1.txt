  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named yxUgKRkwAjePBTsPVQjhGsAGTAqoLIoL",
  "sources": "No data input sources; class declaration does not read external data",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; class does not perform any actions or output",
  "flows": "No data flows; the class is only a placeholder without methods or logic",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical, which may indicate obfuscation or concealment; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code declares a single custom exception class inheriting from Python's Exception class. The class contains no methods, attributes, or logic. The class name is a long, nonsensical string that resembles obfuscated code or an attempt to hide intent. No external input, data processing, or suspicious behavior is present. The code is minimal and straightforward but the class name's obfuscation could be a red flag in some contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple declaration of an exception class with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious logic. The obfuscated name could suggest concealment, but on its own, the code appears benign.",
