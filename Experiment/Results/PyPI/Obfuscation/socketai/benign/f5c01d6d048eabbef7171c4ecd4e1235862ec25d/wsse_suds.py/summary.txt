  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard cryptographic message processing with obfuscation that raises suspicion but lacks concrete evidence of malicious behavior. The malware score is set low, consistent with the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscation justifies a high obfuscated score. The moderate security risk reflects the uncertainty due to obfuscation and cryptographic handling. Further investigation of external functions is recommended before deploying or trusting this code."
