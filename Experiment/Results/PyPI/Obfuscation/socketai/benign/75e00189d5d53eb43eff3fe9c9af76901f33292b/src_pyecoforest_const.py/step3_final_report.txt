  "purpose": "Static configuration setup including URL path, string, list, integers, and a timeout object, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Variable assignments and the creation of an httpx.Timeout object",
  "sinks": "No data flows to sinks; no network requests or data leaks are present",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; only static variable initialization",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static configuration with obfuscated variable names. It imports httpx, defines several variables with seemingly random names, and creates a Timeout object with fixed values. There are no network requests, data transmissions, or malicious patterns. The obfuscation suggests concealment but does not imply malicious intent. All indicators point to benign configuration code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, obfuscated configuration snippet with no malicious activity or security threats detected. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware and security risk scores are appropriately low. No further action is necessary.",
