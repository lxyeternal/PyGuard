{
  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely used for version control or configuration.",
  "sources": "The right-hand side string '0.0.0' is a hardcoded value assigned to the variable.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output; no sinks that could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "N/A - straightforward assignment without data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated or random, but the code itself is simple and does not contain unusual or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a string '0.0.0' to a variable with an obfuscated name. No input reading, no external data, no function calls, no security-sensitive operations. The variable name does not reveal meaningful intent or malicious activity. The string is a common version format. There are no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation techniques beyond the variable name.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risk in this snippet.",
