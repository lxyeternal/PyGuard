{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for error handling or structural purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements for json and httpx modules; class definitions with static string attributes.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, network requests, or external data handling present; no untrusted data sinks identified.",
  "flows": "No active data flows; classes serve as static exception definitions with no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; static string attributes; no methods or logic beyond initializations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, importing standard modules but performing no data processing, network activity, or input/output operations. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. No evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or active vulnerabilities is present. The malware score is correctly 0, reflecting no malicious activity. The obfuscation score is high (~0.8), consistent with the naming. The security risk score is very low (~0.1), as the code is benign and static. The reports accurately interpret the code as benign placeholder or structural classes with no active logic or threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious intent or active vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscation high (~0.8), and security risk very low (~0.1). No modifications are necessary; the assessments are accurate.",
