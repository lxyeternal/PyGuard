{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes related to JSON decoding and HTTP errors, likely for error handling in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Imports of json and httpx modules; class definitions and variable assignments that do not process external input directly.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or execute external commands.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; class initializations are straightforward assignments.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of randomly named classes and variables with no clear functional purpose; no actual data processing, input reading, or network activity observed. The class 'rTUeHlSvBKrLHtaTiRPoYerrQnMAznOf' defines a static attribute, and subclasses define additional attributes, but no behavior or data handling is shown.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions with obfuscated names and static attributes. It imports modules used for error handling but does not perform any operations such as network requests, data processing, or input/output. The structure suggests either placeholder code, intentionally obscured design, or preparatory code for larger functionality. No malicious patterns, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious control flows, are apparent. The code does not process external data nor invoke functions that could lead to security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be benign, serving as a structural or placeholder component with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activity are detected. The overall security risk is very low.",
