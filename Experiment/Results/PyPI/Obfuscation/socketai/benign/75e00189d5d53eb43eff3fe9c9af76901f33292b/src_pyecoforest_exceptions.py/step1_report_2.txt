  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for handling specific errors related to JSON decoding and HTTP errors.",
  "sources": "Import statements for json and httpx modules; class initializations and exception handling classes.",
  "sinks": "None detected; no data output, external network calls, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No significant data flows from sources to sinks; exception classes are defined but not used to process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of nonsensical class and variable names; no functional or malicious logic; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and defines exception classes with obfuscated names. These classes are simple and only store static string attributes. There are no data processing, input handling, network calls, or code execution mechanisms that could be malicious. The naming and structure appear intentionally obfuscated but do not inherently suggest malicious intent. No suspicious behaviors or malicious patterns are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be an obfuscated set of exception class definitions for error handling, with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. It seems to serve as part of a larger, possibly intentionally obscured, codebase but alone does not pose any security threat.",
