{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define custom exception classes and imports modules for JSON parsing and HTTP requests, possibly for handling errors in network or data processing.",
  "sources": "Imports json and httpx modules; references to exceptions json.JSONDecodeError and httpx.HTTPError; class constructors with string attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or output functions present; no use of untrusted data in sensitive operations or network communications shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks observed; code only defines classes and exception handling structures without active data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names without any meaningful logic; no evidence of malicious activities like data exfiltration, network connections, or execution of untrusted input.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and class definitions for custom exceptions. The exception classes include static string attributes that seem to serve as placeholders or internal identifiers. There is no evidence of data processing, network communication, or code execution that could indicate malicious behavior. The obfuscation of class names and variables may be suspicious but does not necessarily imply malicious intent, especially since there are no operations or data flows indicating harm.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code is minimal, mainly defining exception classes with obfuscated names, which alone does not constitute malware or security threats.",
