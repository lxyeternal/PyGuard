{
  "purpose": "Defines enums and a data class for system states, modes, and alarms, used for configuration and status management.",
  "sources": "External constants, class parameters, input dictionaries, and string mappings within class methods.",
  "sinks": "Enum attributes and data class fields populated from external data sources and input parameters.",
  "flows": "External data (strings, dictionaries) flow into enum lookups and attribute assignments via parsing and conversions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic lookups and non-descriptive variable names; reliance on external constants without validation; no malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs configuration parsing, state mapping, and data modeling using enums and a data class. It relies on external constants and dictionaries to interpret input data, converting strings and numbers into internal representations. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, network activity, or obfuscation are present. Variable naming is non-descriptive but consistent with typical placeholder or autogenerated code, not malicious obfuscation. The scores assigned in the reports (malware 0, obfuscated around 0.2, low risk 0.1-0.2) are justified given the code's purpose and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is legitimate configuration and status management logic with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low scores for malware and risk are appropriate, and the overall security posture is sound within its context.",
