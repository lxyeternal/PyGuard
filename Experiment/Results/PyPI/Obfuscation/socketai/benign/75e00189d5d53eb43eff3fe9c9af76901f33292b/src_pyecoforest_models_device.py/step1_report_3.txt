{
  "purpose": "The code defines enums and a dataclass for processing system states, modes, and alarms, likely for an industrial or environmental monitoring system, with configuration and state management functionalities.",
  "sources": "Data is read from imported constants, exception classes, class methods receiving strings or dictionaries, and class attributes in the dataclass.",
  "sinks": "The code performs data parsing and type conversions, but no direct data leaks, network operations, or sensitive data handling are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data from strings and dictionaries flows through class methods that convert and map these inputs to enum members and data class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are present. The code employs dynamic data handling, but all operations appear to be standard data parsing and enumeration mapping.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of enum definitions with class methods to map string inputs or integers to enum instances, and a dataclass for configuration/state storage. The methods use dictionaries and iteration for mappings, which are typical for such patterns. The constants and exception imports are external, but their use appears straightforward and contextually appropriate. No obfuscated language features, malicious behaviors, or suspicious data flows are identified. The data conversions and flow control are standard and do not suggest malware or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The source code appears to be a normal configuration and state management module, with no signs of malicious intent, malware, or security risks. It employs standard design patterns for enums and data classes, with data parsing methods that are typical for such systems.",
