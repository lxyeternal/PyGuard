  "conclusion": "The code is primarily insecure configuration rather than malicious code. The insecure SSL contexts, combined with obfuscated naming, pose a security risk if used in network operations, but no active malware or malicious payloads are present. The high obfuscation and insecure practices justify elevated risk scores. Overall, the reports are accurate and appropriately cautious, with scores reflecting the potential for misuse rather than active malicious intent."
