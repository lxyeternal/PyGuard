{
  "purpose": "The code defines two subclasses that extend message classes from the 'oic' library, adding optional fields related to OAuth2/OpenID Connect PKCE parameters.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class attributes and their default values; no input or external data sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data is sent over the network, written to files, or used in commands; no sinks are present that could leak data or execute untrusted code.",
  "flows": "There are no identifiable data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; the code only modifies class attribute dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "The class and variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. The code uses extensive copying and updating of class attributes, possibly to hide or mask malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from a known library ('oic') and creates subclasses that add optional OAuth2 parameters such as 'code_verifier', 'code_challenge', and 'code_challenge_method'. These are standard PKCE parameters. The obfuscated class and variable names, however, are suspicious and suggest an attempt to conceal intent. The code only manipulates class attribute dictionaries with no external inputs, network operations, or system commands. There are no malicious actions such as data exfiltration, command execution, or network connections. The obfuscation could be an indicator of malicious concealment but is not conclusive on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard extension of OAuth2 message classes to include PKCE parameters, with obfuscated naming possibly intended to hide its purpose. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on the provided code alone.",
