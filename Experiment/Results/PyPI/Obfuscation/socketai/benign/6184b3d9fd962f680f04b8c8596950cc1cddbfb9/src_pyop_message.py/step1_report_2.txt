{
  "purpose": "Define subclasses extending existing message classes with additional or modified fields related to OAuth2/OIDC.",
  "sources": "The code reads class attributes and class variables; it does not take external input or data streams.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data is being processed or written to external systems.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code only modifies class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns detected; code structure is intentionally obscure but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes from external OAuth2/OIDC libraries and subclasses them, adding optional string fields with specific names. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but the code only modifies class attributes by copying and updating dictionaries. There are no external data inputs, network operations, or execution of untrusted code. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malware, is evident. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to conceal intent but does not indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely extends and modifies existing message classes for OAuth2/OIDC flows with additional optional parameters. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is detected. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly intended to obscure intent, but poses no security threat based on this snippet.",
