{
  "purpose": "Define extended message classes for OAuth2 flow with additional fields related to PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange).",
  "sources": "Imported modules and classes from 'oic.oauth2.message' and 'oic.oic'; class attributes and updates",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks detected; class attributes are mostly static or copied from imported classes",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; code mostly defines class attributes and updates",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names, heavily masked variable names, and dynamic attribute updates. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses extending classes from the 'oic' library, updating class attributes with optional string types and specific values for OAuth2 PKCE parameters. The naming scheme appears intentionally obscured but does not demonstrate malicious intent or malicious payloads. The logic is consistent with defining message structures, with no evidence of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior. The obfuscation of class and variable names might be suspicious but could also be a form of code minimization or library masking.\n\nNo external input handling, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The code appears to be part of a larger OAuth2 client implementation, with no direct signs of malware or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code defines OAuth2 message classes with extended attributes for PKCE, using obfuscated names but no malicious or suspicious logic. The obfuscation could be for code protection or unintended, but there is no clear malicious intent or security risk evident.",
