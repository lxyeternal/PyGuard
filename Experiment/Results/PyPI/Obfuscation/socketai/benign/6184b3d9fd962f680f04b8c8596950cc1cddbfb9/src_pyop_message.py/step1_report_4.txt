{
  "purpose": "Extend existing message classes from the oic.oauth2.message and oic.oic modules to include additional optional fields related to OAuth2 PKCE extensions.",
  "sources": "Import statements for classes and constants from external libraries; class attributes referencing class variables; the use of copy() methods to duplicate class-level attributes.",
  "sinks": "No obvious untrusted data input, output, or data flow pathways identified within this code snippet.",
  "flows": "The code copies class-level message attribute definitions and updates them with optional parameters. There is no dynamic data flow from external sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names; no validation or sanitization of data; no input handling or external data processing; minimal code logic, primarily data structure modification.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and constants from well-known OAuth2 libraries, then subclasses these message classes to add or modify certain fields related to PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange). It uses copy() to duplicate existing class attribute dictionaries, then updates them with additional optional fields. No user input, network interaction, or external data processing is present. The code appears to be intended for configuring or extending OAuth2 message structures with optional parameters, not executing any malicious or harmful behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is straightforward and primarily modifies data structures for OAuth2 messages without involving external input, network operations, or suspicious behavior. No signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or malware are evident. The obfuscated class and variable names are a concern but do not imply malicious activity on their own. Overall, this code appears benign and suitable for its intended purpose.",
