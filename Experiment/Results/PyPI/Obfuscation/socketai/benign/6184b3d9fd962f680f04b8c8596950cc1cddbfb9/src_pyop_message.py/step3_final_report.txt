{
  "purpose": "The code extends OAuth2 message classes from the 'oic' library by adding optional PKCE parameters, specifically 'code_verifier', 'code_challenge', and 'code_challenge_method'.",
  "sources": "Class attribute dictionaries within the subclasses, which are initialized by copying parent class attributes.",
  "sinks": "No external input, network activity, or data sinks are present; the code only manipulates class attribute dictionaries.",
  "flows": "The code copies parent class attribute dictionaries and updates them with new optional parameters, without external data flow or untrusted data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Class and variable names are heavily obfuscated and nonsensical, which could be an attempt to conceal intent. No malicious code or external data handling is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines subclasses that extend existing message classes to include additional optional OAuth2 parameters related to PKCE. The obfuscated naming raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious behavior. The code does not perform any network operations, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The modifications are limited to data structure definitions. The obfuscation is superficial and not necessarily malicious. No external input or sinks are involved, and the code appears to serve a legitimate purpose within OAuth2 message handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign extension of OAuth2 message classes with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation warrants cautious scoring but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code poses a low security risk.",
