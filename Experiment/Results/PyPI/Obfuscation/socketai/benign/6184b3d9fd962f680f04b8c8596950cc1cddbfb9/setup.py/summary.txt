  "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated parameter names and string literals, raising suspicion but lacking direct evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants further review, especially examining the full package and dependencies. The scores should reflect high suspicion due to obfuscation but low confidence in confirmed malware. Overall, cautious review is recommended before deployment."
