      "conclusion": "The setup script contains obfuscated parameter names and string literals, raising suspicion but lacking direct evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants further review, especially examining the full package and dependencies. The scores should reflect high suspicion due to obfuscation but low confidence in confirmed malware. Overall, cautious review is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OAuth 2.0 authorization server component, with obfuscation possibly for privacy or concealment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk and malware scores are justified as low, with the obfuscation score being high due to naming complexity."

      "conclusion": "This code is a typical OAuth2 error handling implementation with superficial obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware score remains at 0, and overall security risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard OAuth 2.0 client authentication routine with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains zero. The overall security risk is low, around 0.2-0.3, primarily due to obfuscation. Minor improvements could include stricter validation of decoded credentials and clearer variable naming to facilitate review."

      "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code appears benign with no malicious or obfuscated features. The scoring is consistent and justified, with malware and obfuscation scores at 0 and a low security risk score of 0.2. No adjustments are necessary; the assessments are appropriate given the limited information."

      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated data wrapper with a claim extraction method that does not exhibit malicious behavior. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but static analysis finds no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The low malware score and low risk score are justified given the benign nature of the code. The main concern is potential misuse if integrated with untrusted data, but no active threats are present."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a sophisticated, obfuscated database connection and management library with some incomplete cryptography features. While the obfuscation and placeholders are suspicious and could be used to hide malicious behavior, there is no direct evidence of active malware or malicious activity. The overall security risk is low to moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and incomplete features that could be exploited if misused. Further dynamic analysis and review of the cryptography module are recommended before deployment in security-sensitive environments."
