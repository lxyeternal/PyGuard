  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OAuth 2.0 client authentication routine with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware score remains zero. The overall security risk is low, around 0.2-0.3, primarily due to obfuscation. Minor improvements could include stricter validation of decoded credentials and clearer variable naming to facilitate review."
