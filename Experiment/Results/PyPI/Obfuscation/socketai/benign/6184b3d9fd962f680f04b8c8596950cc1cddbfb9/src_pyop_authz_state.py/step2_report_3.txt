  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, evaluating the reasoning, and ensuring consistency of scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes a standard OAuth 2.0 authorization server, with data flow from input parameters, internal state, and logs.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The report notes obfuscated names, which could be suspicious but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded secrets or network activity are observed. The code appears to implement typical OAuth logic, with no evidence of malware.  \n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Security risk is low (0.2), malware score is 0, obfuscation is high (0.8). This seems reasonable given the obfuscation but no malicious activity.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent. Obfuscation is high, but no malware or vulnerabilities are evident.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar OAuth token management, with data flow into internal storage and logs.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Again, obfuscated naming but no signs of malicious behavior, no network activity, or hardcoded secrets.  \n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware score 0, security risk 0.2, obfuscation 0.7. The low risk and malware scores are justified.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning aligns with the code's apparent behavior. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Standard OAuth token handling, with input from authorization requests and internal storage.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated names, but no malicious activity or suspicious logic.  \n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.3, obfuscation 0.7. The risk score is slightly higher than previous reports but still reasonable given the obfuscation.\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is consistent; obfuscation is high but no malware.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** OAuth token lifecycle management, with standard flows.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated naming, but standard token management logic. No network activity or backdoors.  \n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.3, obfuscation 0.7. These scores seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The reasoning is sound; no malicious behavior detected.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar OAuth token handling, with standard mechanisms.  \n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated names, complex structure, but no signs of malicious activity or data exfiltration.  \n- **Conclusion & Scores:** Malware 0, risk 0.3, obfuscation 0.7. This is consistent.\n\n**Verdict:** The analysis is justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Code presence of issues:** The code appears to implement standard OAuth logic. No evidence of malicious payloads, data exfiltration, or system compromise.  \n- **Obfuscation:** High across all reports, but obfuscation alone doesn't imply malicious intent.  \n- **Malware score:** Consistently 0, which aligns with the analysis. No malicious activity is detected.  \n- **Risk scores:** Generally low (0.2-0.3), justified by the obfuscation but no active threats.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable given the obfuscation but lack evidence of malware.  \n- The high obfuscation scores reflect the difficulty in auditing, which could be a concern for security review, but not necessarily malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.0 — no evidence of malicious behavior.  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.75 — high obfuscation, but not necessarily malicious.  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 — low, given the lack of active threats.\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent and justified. The code appears to be a legitimate OAuth 2.0 implementation with obfuscated naming, which warrants caution but does not indicate malware.",
