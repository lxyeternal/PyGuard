{
  "purpose": "This code implements an OAuth 2.0 authorization server component, managing authorization codes, access tokens, refresh tokens, and subject identifiers with obfuscated class and method names.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as authorization requests, token requests, and internal data structures like dictionaries and UUIDs for token generation.",
  "sinks": "Internal storage (dictionaries), logging, and return values; no network calls or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Authorization request → code creation → token exchange → token validation and refresh, all handled internally without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, use of UUIDs for tokens, no hardcoded secrets or network activity, but high obfuscation which complicates auditing.",
  "analysis": "The code follows standard OAuth 2.0 flows with internal state management, token creation, validation, and refresh mechanisms. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious external activity are evident. Obfuscation is consistent across reports and likely intended for privacy or concealment rather than malicious intent. The use of UUIDs and internal dictionaries aligns with typical OAuth implementations. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious code, or system sabotage are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate OAuth 2.0 authorization server component, with obfuscation possibly for privacy or concealment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk and malware scores are justified as low, with the obfuscation score being high due to naming complexity.",
