{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for OAuth2 error handling and response generation, primarily for authorization and token validation errors.",
  "sources": "Imports from oic.oic.message and local utility module; class initializations and method calls; request data access via self.request.get().",
  "sinks": "Potential data flow from request.get() to response objects; error message string creation; response object methods that may send data.",
  "flows": "Request data retrieved and used in constructing error responses; error messages and response objects returned based on request parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and class names; no explicit hard-coded credentials or secrets; no evidence of malicious code such as network connections, file access, or data exfiltration; code appears standard for error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a hierarchy of custom exception classes mainly for OAuth2-related errors, with some classes constructing error response objects. The request data is accessed via self.request.get(), which is typical for handling request parameters. The code does not perform any network activity, file manipulation, or data exfiltration. Obfuscated class and variable names hinder clarity but do not by themselves indicate malicious intent. No suspicious logic or malicious payloads are evident. Overall, the code appears to serve as part of an error handling framework for OAuth2, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error handling module for OAuth2 flows with obfuscated naming but no malicious activity detected. It likely functions to generate proper error responses based on request parameters. No malware or security risks are apparent from this analysis.",
