  "conclusion": "This code is a typical OAuth2 error handling implementation with superficial obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware score remains at 0, and overall security risk is low."
