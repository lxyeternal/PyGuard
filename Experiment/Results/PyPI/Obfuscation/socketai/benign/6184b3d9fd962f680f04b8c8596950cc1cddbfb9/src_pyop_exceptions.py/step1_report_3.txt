{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and some methods related to OAuth2 authorization responses, error handling, and request validation in an authorization server context.",
  "sources": "Imports from oic.oic.message and a local utility module; class constructors and methods accessing request data; usage of error response classes.",
  "sinks": "Creating error response objects; accessing 'request' dictionary for 'redirect_uri', 'response_type', and 'state'; returning response objects or None.",
  "flows": "Request data (e.g., 'redirect_uri', 'response_type') is retrieved in method QELNLcKohaLvIgjFyfVOJPWHSNXPvPwI and used to generate error responses or None.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs. The code appears straightforward, mainly handling OAuth2 error responses and exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes, some inheriting from ValueError or Exception, with additional attributes. The method QELNLcKohaLvIgjFyfVOJPWHSNXPvPwI checks request parameters and constructs error responses accordingly, using imported classes like AuthorizationErrorResponse and ClientRegistrationErrorResponse. The logic is standard for OAuth2 error handling, with no signs of data exfiltration, network communication, or malicious behavior. The code does not perform any dynamic code execution, network calls, or access sensitive data beyond request parameters. Overall, the code appears to implement error handling in a typical OAuth2 server context without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation of OAuth2 error response handling with custom exceptions. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are evident. It functions as intended for error management in OAuth flows.",
