{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and utility functions for handling OAuth2/OpenID error responses and request validation.",
  "sources": "Import statements for external modules; class constructors reading 'message', 'parsed_request', and request data such as 'redirect_uri', 'response_type'.",
  "sinks": "Use of request data (e.g., 'redirect_uri', 'response_type', 'state') in constructing error responses; potential exception message handling.",
  "flows": "Request data is read in methods like QELNLcKohaLvIgjFyfVOJPWHSNXPvPwI; then used to generate OAuth2 error responses via classes like AuthorizationErrorResponse.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious URL or domain access, or malicious code patterns detected. Exception classes have minimal logic; no dynamic code execution or obfuscation present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines custom exception classes and methods to generate OAuth2 error responses based on request parameters. It retrieves 'redirect_uri', 'response_type', and 'state' from request data to produce error responses when certain conditions are met. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. All data handling appears standard for OAuth2 error processing, with no suspicious or malicious behavior detected. No obfuscated code, no external network calls, and no manipulation of system or environment variables are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to serve as part of an OAuth2/OpenID Connect error handling framework. It does not contain malicious behavior, sabotage, or supply chain attack elements. It is a standard implementation for managing OAuth2 errors with no evident security risks or malware indicators.",
