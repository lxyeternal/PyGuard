  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, comparing their conclusions with the code, and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary of the code:**\n\n- The code defines multiple custom exception classes, mostly for OAuth2 error handling (e.g., invalid_grant, invalid_token, invalid_scope, invalid_client, invalid_request).\n- The class `QELNLcKohaLvIgjFyfVOJPWHSNXPvPwI` constructs OAuth2 error responses based on request parameters (`redirect_uri`, `response_type`, `state`) and the error code.\n- Other classes are primarily for error response creation or exception handling.\n- The code is heavily obfuscated in class and method names, but the logic appears to be standard OAuth2 error handling.\n- No network, file, or system command operations are present.\n- No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or malicious payloads are evident.\n- The purpose is to generate OAuth2 error responses and handle exceptions in an OAuth2/OpenID Connect context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  The reports do not identify any actual vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. They focus on obfuscation and standard error handling.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports correctly note the obfuscation but find no malicious intent or security flaws. They seem consistent.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  All reports assign malware scores of 0 or very low, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior. Security risk scores are also low, consistent with the analysis.\n\n- **Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign high risk scores; all are below 0.5, which is appropriate given the code's apparent benign purpose.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  All reports agree on malware score = 0, which is justified.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they focus on code analysis and obfuscation, not on speculative vulnerabilities.\n\n- **Scores consistency:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the code's analysis—obfuscated but benign.\n\n---\n\n### Critical observations:\n\n- The obfuscation is notable but not malicious; it likely aims to hinder readability.\n- No signs of supply chain attack vectors, such as malicious payloads, network exploits, or data exfiltration.\n- The code's purpose is standard OAuth2 error handling, with no suspicious logic.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0.8–0.9 (obfuscation is significant but not malicious)  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (low, standard error handling, no vulnerabilities)\n\n**Overall conclusion:**  \nThe code appears to be a standard OAuth2 error handling module with obfuscated naming. There are no indications of malicious intent, malware, or supply chain compromise. The obfuscation likely aims to hinder analysis but does not impact security directly.\n\n---\n\n**My recommendation:**  \n- Keep the obfuscation under review; if this code is part of a supply chain, ensure it is maintained securely.\n- No further security concerns are identified based on this code snippet.\n\n**Final estimated scores:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThese align with the detailed analysis above.",
