  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing the code and the details provided.\n\n**General Observations:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining custom exception classes and methods related to OAuth2/OpenID Connect error handling.\n- The code uses heavily obfuscated class and method names, which can hinder readability but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.\n- No external network activity, file operations, or system commands are evident.\n- The request data is accessed via `self.request.get()`, and error responses are generated accordingly.\n- The code appears to be a standard OAuth2 error handling framework, with no signs of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or sabotage.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n- **Presence of issues in the code:**  \n  All reports correctly identify that the code is primarily about OAuth2 error handling, with no malicious or suspicious code patterns. No issues such as hardcoded secrets, network calls, or malicious payloads are present.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic:**  \n  The reports are consistent; they recognize the obfuscation but do not attribute malicious intent to it. They correctly identify the code as standard OAuth2 error handling.\n\n- **Scores assigned to each issue:**  \n  - Malware scores are all zero, which aligns with the analysis that no malicious activity is present.\n  - Obfuscation scores are high (0.8-0.9), justified by the heavily obfuscated class and method names.\n  - Security risk scores are low (0.1-0.2), consistent with the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious behavior.\n\n- **Risk scores higher than 0.5:**  \n  None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.5, which is appropriate given the analysis.\n\n- **Malware scores justification:**  \n  All reports assign a malware score of 0, justified by the lack of malicious activity or payloads.\n\n- **Claims based on assumptions:**  \n  The reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they recognize obfuscation but do not infer malicious intent from it.\n\n- **Consistency of scores with the report's content:**  \n  The scores are consistent with the descriptions and the code analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n\n- The code is obfuscated but appears to be a standard OAuth2 error handling module.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security vulnerabilities.\n- The obfuscation seems to be a deliberate attempt to hinder readability, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Final Estimations:\n\n**Malware score:**  \n**0** — No malicious activity detected.\n\n**Obfuscated score:**  \n**0.8-0.9** — High, justified by the obfuscated class and method names.\n\n**Risk score:**  \n**0.2** — Low, consistent with standard error handling code.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\nThe reports are accurate in their assessments. The code is a typical OAuth2 error handling implementation with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or supply chain compromises.\n\n**My overall estimate:**  \n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.85 (average of the reports' obfuscation scores)  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and analysis, confirming that the code is safe and not malicious.",
