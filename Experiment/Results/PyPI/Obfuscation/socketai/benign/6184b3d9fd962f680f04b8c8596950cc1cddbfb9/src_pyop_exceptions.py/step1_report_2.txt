{
  "purpose": "This code defines custom exception classes and a class related to OAuth2 authorization error handling, including methods for generating error responses.",
  "sources": "Imports from external modules, class initializers, and method calls within the code, particularly in QELNLcKohaLvIgjFyfVOJPWHSNXPvPwI methods.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the request.get() calls retrieving 'redirect_uri', 'response_type', and 'state' from the request object; creation of error response objects.",
  "flows": "Data flows from request.get() inputs to the creation of error response objects, which may be returned by methods.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and variable names (e.g., dgkjAnWpbZWFGstqRanniXznRmcwOOsw), which may hinder analysis but is not inherently malicious. No hardcoded credentials or secret tokens are visible. No network operations, file manipulations, or system commands are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists primarily of custom exception classes and an OAuth2 error handling class. The class QELNLcKohaLvIgjFyfVOJPWHSNXPvPwI constructs an OAuth2 authorization error response if certain request parameters are present, returning a response object. The code relies on imported modules for message types. Variable and class names are intentionally obfuscated, but the logic appears to be for standard OAuth2 error handling without any external or malicious behavior. There are no signs of data exfiltration, network activity, or system modifications.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard OAuth2 error handling with obfuscated naming to hinder readability. There are no indications of malicious behavior or malware. The code seems legitimate and aligns with typical OAuth2 flow error handling patterns.",
