{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes and OAuth2 error response handlers, primarily for error management in OAuth2/OpenID Connect workflows.",
  "sources": "Request parameters such as 'redirect_uri', 'response_type', and 'state' accessed via 'self.request.get()'.",
  "sinks": "Construction of OAuth2 error response objects like AuthorizationErrorResponse and ClientRegistrationErrorResponse, which are returned as responses.",
  "flows": "Request parameters flow into error response objects through class methods, particularly in QELNLcKohaLvIgjFyfVOJPWHSNXPvPwI.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of class and method names, which reduces readability but does not indicate malicious intent. No external network, file, or system command activity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard OAuth2 error handling module with heavily obfuscated class and method names. It retrieves request parameters and constructs appropriate error responses. No malicious payloads, network activity, or security vulnerabilities are evident. Obfuscation appears to be superficial, likely for code protection, not malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical OAuth2 error handling implementation with superficial obfuscation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware score remains at 0, and overall security risk is low.",
