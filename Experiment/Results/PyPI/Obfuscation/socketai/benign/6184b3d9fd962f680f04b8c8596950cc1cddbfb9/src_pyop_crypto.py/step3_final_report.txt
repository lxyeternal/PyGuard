{
  "purpose": "Implements symmetric AES CBC encryption and decryption with key derived from SHA-256 hash of a passphrase, using custom padding and base64 encoding.",
  "sources": "Input data to encryption/decryption methods, passphrase for key derivation.",
  "sinks": "Encrypted/decrypted data returned as base64 strings; no external communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Input passphrase -> SHA-256 hash -> key; plaintext -> padding -> IV + ciphertext -> base64; base64 input -> decode -> IV + ciphertext -> decrypt -> unpad -> plaintext.",
  "anomalies": "Use of custom padding scheme; obfuscated class/method names in some reports; potential typo in 'Cryptodome' import (should be 'Crypto').",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard AES CBC encryption/decryption with proper IV handling, key derivation, and padding. No hardcoded secrets or malicious behavior detected. Obfuscation and import typo are superficial and do not indicate malicious intent. The cryptographic practices are sound assuming proper key management. No network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility implementing AES CBC mode with proper practices. No evidence of malware or malicious sabotage. Obfuscation is superficial and does not compromise security. Overall, the code is benign with low security risk.",
