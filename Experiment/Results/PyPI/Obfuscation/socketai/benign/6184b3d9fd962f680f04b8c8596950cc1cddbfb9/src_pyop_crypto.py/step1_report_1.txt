  "purpose": "This code implements symmetric encryption and decryption using AES in CBC mode with a key derived from a SHA-256 hash of a passphrase.",
  "sources": "Input data to be encrypted/decrypted via the methods rDnCPxuGpjjQGqFihskQHuPUQdqnWwPG and qTGmcuaZdqAueuDqHvgGltxNfAtkFHWS",
  "sinks": "Encrypted or decrypted data returned as base64-encoded strings; no evident data leakage or external data exfiltration points",
  "flows": "Input data is processed by the encryption/decryption functions, which encode/decode data, generate IVs, and use AES in CBC mode for cryptographic operations",
  "anomalies": "Code uses custom padding method, which is non-standard but not inherently malicious; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious behavior detected; cryptographic practices are generally correct but rely on proper key management",
  "analysis": "The code derives an AES key from a SHA-256 hash of a passphrase, then encrypts or decrypts data using AES in CBC mode with PKCS7-like padding. It concatenates IVs with ciphertexts for safe storage. The de-padding method removes padding by truncating based on the last byte. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious network activity are present. Usage of 'Cryptodome' library is legitimate. The code appears to be a standard symmetric encryption utility, but its purpose depends on how it is integrated into a larger system.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard encryption and decryption operations with no evident malicious intent or security issues. It does not contain obfuscation or malware. The overall security risk appears low, provided that the passphrase is securely managed.",
