{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package intended to assess the fairness of machine learning datasets.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file; no other input sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified; no output or network operations.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input sources to sinks; the script primarily calls setup() with static arguments.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or non-descriptive variable names; variable names appear intentionally obfuscated without meaningful context. No hardcoded credentials, no network operations, no malicious code logic.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python package setup using setuptools, with obfuscated variable names and a straightforward setup() call. It reads a README file but does not process or expose its content beyond reading. There are no network connections, data leaks, or suspicious operations. The use of non-standard variable names suggests possible obfuscation, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The package appears to be a benign setup script for a machine learning fairness library.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, supply chain threats, or security risks are evident.",
