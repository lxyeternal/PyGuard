  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package, defining its metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; setting package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks that process untrusted data or perform actions with untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md file (source) and passing data to setup() for package configuration (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns; no dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The script imports 'setuptools' and defines package metadata with obfuscated variable names. It reads a README file for description and calls setup() with basic package info. The variable names are intentionally obscure, but the logic is standard for package setup scripts. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to be a normal setup script with obfuscated variable names, which may indicate an attempt to conceal intent but does not inherently suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. There are no malicious behaviors, backdoors, or security risks present. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not impact the security of the code.",
