{
  "purpose": "The code sets up a Python package, providing metadata and dependencies for distribution.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'README.md' file for long description; package metadata definitions; import from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks identified that could lead to data leaks or code execution vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' -> stored in long description variable; package setup parameters (name, version, dependencies) do not process untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names with seemingly random strings, but no malicious logic. No hardcoded credentials or secret data. The package name appears obfuscated but is not malicious in intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup using setuptools with obfuscated variable names. It reads a README file for description, defines package metadata, and dependencies. No code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior detected. Variable naming is unusual but not malicious. No code execution or network activity present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
