  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, using setuptools to define package metadata and requirements.",
  "sources": "Reading the README.md file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network activity; static data flow with no external or dynamic data handling.",
  "flows": "Read from README.md to setup configuration; no external or untrusted data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, nonsensical package name, but no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical Python package setup script with obfuscated variable names. It reads a README file and calls setup() with package metadata. No network activity, data leaks, or code injection are present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to conceal variable intent but not malicious. The package name is nonsensical, which could be suspicious but does not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), justified by the variable names. The security risk score is low (~0.2), reflecting minimal threat despite obfuscation. Overall, the code is benign, with superficial obfuscation, and no security risks or malware present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard Python setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, data leaks, or security threats are evident. The current scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
