  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package aimed at machine learning fairness analysis.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; static string variables containing package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or send data externally.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' file; static data flows into package setup configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names and obfuscated strings suggest code that is intentionally made obscure. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. Variable names are nonsensical, but that alone is not malicious. The use of open file and setup functions is typical.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard Python setup configuration with intentionally obfuscated variable names. It reads a 'README.md' file, and sets package metadata for distribution. There is no evidence of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior. No external network connections, suspicious commands, or malicious payloads are present. The code appears to be benign, just obfuscated.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and no signs of malicious intent. It is used to package a Python library, with no suspicious behavior detected.",
