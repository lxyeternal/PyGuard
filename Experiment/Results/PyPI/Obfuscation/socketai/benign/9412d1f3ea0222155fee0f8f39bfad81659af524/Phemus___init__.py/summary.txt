  "conclusion": "The import statements with obfuscated names do not provide evidence of malicious behavior but warrant caution. The scores reflect suspicion due to obfuscation but are justified by the absence of active malicious code. No immediate threat is identified, but further review of the module contents is recommended to ensure supply chain integrity."
