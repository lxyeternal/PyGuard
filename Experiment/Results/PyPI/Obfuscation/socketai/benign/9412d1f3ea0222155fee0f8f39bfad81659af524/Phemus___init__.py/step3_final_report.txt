  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency by analyzing import statements with obfuscated names for potential malicious behavior or sabotage.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communications are present; potential concern is obfuscation concealing malicious code.",
  "flows": "Import statements as sources; no data flow or execution paths visible.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated module and function names without accompanying code; potential concealment of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity. The absence of executable code, data processing, or network activity indicates no active malicious behavior. The obfuscation of identifiers is a red flag but can also be due to proprietary or auto-generated code. The scores assigned across reports—malware at 0, obfuscation high (~0.7), and low to moderate security risk (~0.2–0.4)—are consistent with the evidence. Given the lack of direct malicious indicators, the current scores are appropriate. Further investigation of the actual module implementations is necessary to confirm or deny malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The import statements with obfuscated names do not provide evidence of malicious behavior but warrant caution. The scores reflect suspicion due to obfuscation but are justified by the absence of active malicious code. No immediate threat is identified, but further review of the module contents is recommended to ensure supply chain integrity.",
