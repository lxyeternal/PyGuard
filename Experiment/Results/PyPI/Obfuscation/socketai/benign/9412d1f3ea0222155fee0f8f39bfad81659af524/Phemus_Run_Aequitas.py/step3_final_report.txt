{
  "purpose": "The code orchestrates a machine learning pipeline involving dataset perturbation, retraining, and evaluation across different modes ('Random', 'Semi', 'Fully').",
  "sources": "Dataset object properties and function parameters, external module functions imported with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "Function calls to imported modules, data directory reads/writes, no network or system commands visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from dataset properties through function calls based on mode, leading to retraining and evaluation functions.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of module and variable names; no explicit malicious code, network activity, or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard ML pipeline orchestrator with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation. The obfuscation may be for code protection or proprietary reasons. The functions invoked are from external modules, whose internal behavior is unknown, but their naming suggests standard ML operations. No suspicious patterns or malicious constructs are present within this fragment. The low malware score (around 0.1) and low security risk (around 0.2) are consistent with the absence of malicious activity, while the high obfuscation score (around 0.7) reflects the naming pattern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is most likely a legitimate ML pipeline with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation warrants cautious review of dependencies, but the code itself appears benign.",
