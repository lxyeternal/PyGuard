  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a sophisticated, obfuscated ML bias detection and retraining pipeline. While obfuscation tactics are high, there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior such as data theft, network communication, or system sabotage. The malware score should be low, and the security risk moderate due to obfuscation. Monitoring and further static/dynamic analysis are recommended to confirm safety."
