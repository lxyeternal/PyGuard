  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign, serving as a statistical analysis utility, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review. Malware and security risk scores are low to moderate, consistent with the absence of explicit malicious behavior but acknowledging potential concealment. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious intent but should be monitored if used in sensitive environments."
