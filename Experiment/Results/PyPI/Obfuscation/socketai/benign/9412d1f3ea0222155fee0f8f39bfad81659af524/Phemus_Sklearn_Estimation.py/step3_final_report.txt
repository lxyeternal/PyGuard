{
  "purpose": "Perform statistical and bias analysis on datasets using dynamically loaded models, with obfuscated variable and function names.",
  "sources": "Dataset attributes, model files loaded via joblib.load(), input data passed to functions, random number generator seeded with system time.",
  "sinks": "Model prediction outputs, array manipulations, return statements with computed bias metrics.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed and reshaped, then passed to model.predict(), with results compared and aggregated to compute bias estimates.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive names, placeholder functions assigned to warnings, use of dynamic model loading, and complex data flow that could conceal malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs ML bias estimation and dataset analysis, with no network activity or system modifications. Obfuscation and placeholder functions are suspicious but not evidence of malicious activity. Model loading from external sources could be exploited if models are malicious, but no such activity is detected here. The code's operations are typical for ML pipelines, and the obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign, serving as a statistical analysis utility, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review. Malware and security risk scores are low to moderate, consistent with the absence of explicit malicious behavior but acknowledging potential concealment. Overall, the code does not exhibit malicious intent but should be monitored if used in sensitive environments.",
