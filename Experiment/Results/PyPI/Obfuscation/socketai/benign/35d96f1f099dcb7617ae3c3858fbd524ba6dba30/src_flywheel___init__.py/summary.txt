  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a set of internal import statements with heavily obfuscated identifiers. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation pattern warrants further review of the imported modules. The current scores are appropriate; I would assign a malware score of 0.1, an obfuscated score of 0.85, and a security risk score of 0.35 to reflect cautious suspicion due to obfuscation but no active malicious indicators."
