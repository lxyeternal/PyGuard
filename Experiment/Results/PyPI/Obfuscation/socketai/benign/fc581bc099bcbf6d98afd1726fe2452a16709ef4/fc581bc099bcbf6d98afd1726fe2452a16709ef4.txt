The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious intent based solely on this snippet. The malware score remains 0, the obfuscated score is justified at approximately 0.7 due to the obfuscated names, and the security risk score is low (~0.2)."

The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the overall risk score remains low (~0.2)."

The obfuscation is moderate and likely for attribution or code hiding, but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score should be 0."

The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature. The main concern is obfuscation, which does not equate to malicious intent, and the use of default timestamps, which is a common pattern but could be improved with better default value handling."

While obfuscated and complex, it does not exhibit malicious activity or malware. The primary concern is misuse with malicious input, but the code's functions are standard cryptographic data handling routines."
