  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, complex data model used for security data processing. It contains no malware, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation is moderate and likely for attribution or code hiding, but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk is low, and the malware score should be 0."
