  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but benign, with no signs of malware or malicious activity. The primary concern is obfuscation which could hide malicious code, but current analysis finds no evidence of such. The security risk is low, and the malware score is 0. The obfuscation score is high (~0.75), and the overall risk score remains low (~0.2)."
