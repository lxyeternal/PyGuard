{
  "purpose": "Import specific modules and classes from the 'common_osint_model' package for use in OSINT-related analysis or data handling.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'common_osint_model.models' submodules: host, domain, service, autonomous_system, http, tls, ssh.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involved; the code only imports modules and classes without executing untrusted data or performing actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis needed as this code only imports modules; no runtime data flow occurs.",
  "anomalies": "All imports are from the same package and appear to be straightforward. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or unusual language features detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports classes and modules from a structured package, seemingly for OSINT purposes, with no signs of malicious behavior such as dynamic code execution, backdoors, or suspicious imports. The naming conventions are consistent with typical models used in security and OSINT tools. The structure is simple and standard. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard import statement section for an OSINT tool or module, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears benign and typical for such applications.",
