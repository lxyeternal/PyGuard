  "conclusion": "The code appears benign in isolation, with obfuscation being the primary concern. Without further context or active code, the likelihood of malicious intent is low. The current scores are consistent with the evidence, indicating a cautious but benign assessment. Further review of the full package or runtime behavior is recommended to confirm intent."
