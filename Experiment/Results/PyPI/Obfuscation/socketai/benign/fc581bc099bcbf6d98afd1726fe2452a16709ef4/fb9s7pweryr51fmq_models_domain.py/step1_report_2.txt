  "purpose": "Define data models for handling address, contact, and domain-related information using pydantic.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function inputs and class instantiations, especially via pydantic model fields. It also accesses datetime.now(UTC) for default values.",
  "sinks": "Potential untrusted data flows include default datetime values and optional string fields that could contain external input if instantiated with user data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external input (possibly user data) into the pydantic models, with default datetime assignments at object creation. No explicit network or file I/O present.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses datetime.now(UTC) as default values for datetime fields, which can lead to unpredictable behavior if instantiated multiple times. All class fields are standard data containers; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two pydantic models with optional and required fields, mainly strings and datetimes. The datetime fields use current UTC time as defaults, which is common but can sometimes introduce issues with reproducibility or predictable defaults. No external inputs or network operations are present. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, no hardcoded credentials, nor any suspicious functions. The models appear to be straightforward data containers without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation of data models for addresses and domain info, with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The use of default current UTC timestamps is typical and not inherently risky. Overall, this code appears benign, with no security threats identified.",
