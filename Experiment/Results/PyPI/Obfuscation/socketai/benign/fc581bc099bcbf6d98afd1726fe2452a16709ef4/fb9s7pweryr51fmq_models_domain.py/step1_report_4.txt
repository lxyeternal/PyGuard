{
  "purpose": "Define data models for address and domain-related information, possibly for a network or domain analysis tool.",
  "sources": "The code reads static class definitions and assigns current timestamps to certain fields during class instantiation.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are evident; the code does not process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "N/A - no runtime data flow analysis needed as the code only defines classes with default values.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now(UTC) as default value in class field definitions; this is a common pattern but can lead to multiple timestamp issues if not careful. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. No suspicious function calls or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models with optional and required fields. Timestamps are assigned at class load time via default factory methods, which is acceptable but can cause identical timestamps for all instances if class is loaded once. No external input handling, no dynamic code execution, and no suspicious data flows are evident. No signs of malicious intent or malicious code. The code appears purely for data modeling, with no network activity, obfuscation, or potential malware behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on data structure definitions with no apparent malicious or security concerns. It does not include any suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code.",
