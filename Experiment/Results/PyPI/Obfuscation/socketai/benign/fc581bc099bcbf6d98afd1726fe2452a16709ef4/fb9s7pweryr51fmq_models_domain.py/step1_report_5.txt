{
  "purpose": "The code defines two data models using Pydantic for handling structured data, likely related to geographic or network information.",
  "sources": "Data sources include optional string fields and datetime fields initialized with current UTC time; no external input functions or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or output points are present; the data models are primarily for data validation and storage.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive functions; models are for data representation without processing logic that handles untrusted data.",
  "anomalies": "Datetime fields are set with default values using datetime.now(UTC), which could lead to inconsistent timestamps if used improperly, but not malicious. No hardcoded credentials, code injection, or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions with optional fields and default datetime values set at class load time. No external input handling, network communication, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The naming appears obfuscated but does not imply malicious intent; it might be auto-generated or intentionally obscured. There are no evident attempts to execute code, send data, or access sensitive resources maliciously.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign data model definitions with no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It does not include any suspicious activity or obfuscation that indicates malicious intent.",
