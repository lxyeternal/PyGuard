  "purpose": "Define data models for handling address and domain registration information with timestamp fields.",
  "sources": "Input data can come from external sources through instantiation of the models, especially user inputs or external API data.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leakage points include serialization or storage of the models; no explicit data sinks are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external inputs into model instances; timestamps are assigned at instantiation; no data flows to external systems within this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now(UTC) at class attribute level may cause shared mutable default, but it is not malicious; no hardcoded credentials, suspicious strings, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models, with optional fields and timestamp fields set to current UTC time at class load. No dynamic code execution, network operations, or data leaks are present. The timestamps are assigned as default values at class definition time, which may not reflect current time per instance, but this is a known pattern rather than malicious. No hidden backdoors, code injection, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is straightforward data modeling without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It appears to be legitimate, standard code for data validation and structure. No security risks or malware indications are identified.",
