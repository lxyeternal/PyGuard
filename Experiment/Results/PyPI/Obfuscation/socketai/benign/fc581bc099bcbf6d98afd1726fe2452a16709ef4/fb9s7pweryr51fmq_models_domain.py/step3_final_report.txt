  "purpose": "Data models for address and domain information with timestamp fields.",
  "sources": "Optional string fields and datetime fields initialized with datetime.now(UTC).",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no external I/O or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Data is assigned during model instantiation; no flow leading to data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of datetime.now(UTC) at class attribute level causes shared default timestamps; variable names are obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide purpose but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines straightforward Pydantic models with optional fields and timestamp defaults. The use of datetime.now(UTC) at class level is a known pattern that can lead to shared timestamps across instances but is not malicious. Variable names are obfuscated, which may be stylistic or auto-generated, but this alone does not imply malicious behavior. No code injection, network activity, hardcoded secrets, or data leaks are present. The malware score is appropriately zero, and obfuscation is high due to variable naming, but not malicious. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to timestamp default behavior, which is not a security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as data models with some obfuscation in variable names. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the code's nature. The main concern is obfuscation, which does not equate to malicious intent, and the use of default timestamps, which is a common pattern but could be improved with better default value handling.",
