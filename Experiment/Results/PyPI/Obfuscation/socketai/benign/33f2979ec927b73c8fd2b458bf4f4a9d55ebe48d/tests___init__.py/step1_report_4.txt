{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script that performs data processing and possibly some output generation. No explicit purpose related to malicious activity is evident.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command-line arguments, environment variables, or file reads (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if invoked.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to sinks such as network or file system operations.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or backdoors are identified. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unnecessary complexity observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly from start to end. It performs typical data handling and processing without any indications of malicious behavior. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No hardcoded secrets, suspicious network activity, or privacy violations detected. The structure is straightforward, with no obfuscated or misleading elements.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The code appears to be benign, with standard behavior and no suspicious patterns.",
