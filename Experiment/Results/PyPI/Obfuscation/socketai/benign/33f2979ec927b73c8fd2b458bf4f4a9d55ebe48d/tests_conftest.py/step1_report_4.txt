{
  "purpose": "The code defines functions for evaluating a model using numpy arrays and partial functions, along with fixtures for testing evaluation functions and scoring metrics.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from NDArray objects, environment variables via imported modules, and input parameters from test fixtures.",
  "sinks": "Uses the input data in mathematical operations and function calls; no clear data sinks like network or file I/O are present.",
  "flows": "Input arrays are processed in numpy operations and passed to functions that compute evaluation metrics, with no external data or system calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names with no documentation, and complex nested loops that obscure the data flow. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs numpy-based computations for evaluation purposes, using partial functions to create customized scoring functions. No network activity, file access, or suspicious code like system commands or cryptomining routines are present. The obfuscated variable names appear to serve code obfuscation rather than malicious intent. The use of the 'pytest' fixture suggests testing but does not indicate malicious activity. The code appears to be standard scientific computation with testing scaffolding, with no evident malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign evaluation and testing framework with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial and primarily for obscuring variable names, not malicious payloads.",
