  "purpose": "Validate that the generated options table matches the stored markdown documentation.",
  "sources": "Reads a markdown file from a relative path; uses gen_options_table(_OPTIONS_SCHEMA) to generate data; compares the two.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or external data handling.",
  "flows": "Reads file content -> generates options table -> compares content -> fails if mismatch.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; use of undefined variable 'msg' in pytest.fail().",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward validation of documentation consistency. The obfuscated variable names suggest code concealment but are not malicious. The undefined 'msg' is a bug that would cause a runtime error but does not indicate malicious intent. No external data, network activity, or code injection is present. The scores assigned across reports are consistent: malware score at 0, obfuscation moderate (~0.4), and low security risk (~0.1). The primary concern is the 'msg' variable, which should be fixed, but this does not impact security. Overall, the code is benign, serving as a documentation check with superficial obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, controlled test script with obfuscated variable names and a minor bug ('msg' undefined). There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the code's behavior.",
