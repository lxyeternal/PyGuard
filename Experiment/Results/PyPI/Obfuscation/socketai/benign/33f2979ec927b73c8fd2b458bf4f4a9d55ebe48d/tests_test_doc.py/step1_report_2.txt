{
  "purpose": "The code reads a markdown file and compares its contents to a generated options table for testing purposes, ensuring consistency between a saved reference and dynamically generated output.",
  "sources": "Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'docs' / 'snippets' / 'dakota.md'; the open() call reads the file content.",
  "sinks": "The file content is read into a variable; no data is written elsewhere or sent over the network.",
  "flows": "Source: reading file -> variable assignment -> comparison with generated table.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors. No dynamic code execution or obfuscation observed. Variable names are obfuscated but are consistent with typical test code practices.",
  "analysis": "The script performs file existence check, reads the file content, and compares it to a generated string from a schema. It uses pytest to handle failures, which is standard for testing. No untrusted input handling beyond file reading, no data leaks, and no suspicious network activity or system modifications are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward test to verify generated documentation matches a reference version. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
