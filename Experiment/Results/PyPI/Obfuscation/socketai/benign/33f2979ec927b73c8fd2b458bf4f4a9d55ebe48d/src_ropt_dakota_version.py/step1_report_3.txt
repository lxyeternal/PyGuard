  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, with conditional typing support.",
  "sources": "Constant assignment to version variables, conditional import statement.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or perform security-sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; only static assignments are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names and a conditional toggle for type hints, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets version information using static strings and tuples. It employs a boolean flag to conditionally import typing modules and define type hints, which could be used for obfuscation or complexity but does not indicate malicious intent. No input handling, network activity, or other security risks are present. The variable naming appears intentionally obscure but functionally harmless. Overall, this code is benign and solely for version metadata.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, obfuscated version declaration setup with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
