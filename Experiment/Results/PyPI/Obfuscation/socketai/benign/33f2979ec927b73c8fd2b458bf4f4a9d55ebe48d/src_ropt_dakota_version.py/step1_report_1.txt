  "purpose": "Define package version information with conditional typing support.",
  "sources": "Reading of version strings and version tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks.",
  "flows": "Assignment of version string and tuple directly from hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and a conditional import that does not affect core functionality. No actual malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines version information for a package. It includes a boolean variable with an obfuscated name controlling whether type hints are imported and used. The import is conditional, but since the boolean is set to False, the code defaults to using 'object' for the type alias, which does not introduce any dynamic or malicious behavior. The version info is hardcoded and straightforward. No external data sources, network calls, or potentially dangerous operations are present. The variable names are deliberately obfuscated, but this appears to be a form of code hiding or minimization rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving only to define version constants with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
