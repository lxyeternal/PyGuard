  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the scores.\n\n**Overall Code Review:**\n\n- The code is a straightforward version info definition with obfuscated variable names.\n- The boolean controlling the import is set to False, so the code defaults to using `object` as the type alias, which is benign.\n- All version data is hardcoded, with no external input, network activity, or dynamic behavior.\n- The obfuscation appears to be a minimal attempt to obscure variable names, not an indicator of malicious intent.\n- No suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### **Detailed Analysis of Each Report**\n\n#### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define package version info with conditional typing support.\n- **Findings:** No malicious behavior, only obfuscated variable names, conditional import that doesn't affect core functionality.\n- **Score Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — Correct, no malware detected.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — High, variable names are intentionally obscure.\n  - **Risk:** 0 — No security risk, static data.\n- **Verdict:** Accurate assessment.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define version info with conditional type annotations.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated boolean toggle, no external data, benign static assignments.\n- **Score Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — Correct.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7 — Reasonable, variable names are obscure.\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 — Slightly elevated due to obfuscation, but no real security concern.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Version info with conditional typing.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated toggle, static assignments, no malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — Correct.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.8 — Obfuscation is significant.\n  - **Risk:** 0 — No security risk.\n- **Verdict:** Valid.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Version info with obfuscated control flow.\n- **Findings:** Obfuscated boolean, static data, no external or malicious behavior.\n- **Score Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — Correct.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.4 — Less obfuscated, but still present.\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 — Slight obfuscation risk, but no real security concern.\n- **Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n#### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Version info with obfuscated control flow.\n- **Findings:** Similar obfuscation pattern, no malicious activity.\n- **Score Justification:**\n  - **Malware:** 0 — Correct.\n  - **Obfuscated:** 0.7 — High, variable names are intentionally confusing.\n  - **Risk:** 0.1 — No actual security risk.\n- **Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign 0, consistent with the benign nature of the code.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** High, reflecting the intentionally obscure variable names and control flow, which could hinder readability but not necessarily indicate malicious intent.\n- **Risk Score:** Mostly 0 or very low, which aligns with the static, hardcoded data and lack of external or dynamic behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **Final Personal Assessment**\n\n**Malware:** 0 — No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated:** 0.7 — The variable names are intentionally obscure, but this is more of a code style or minimization technique rather than malicious obfuscation.\n\n**Security Risk:** 0.1 — Slightly elevated due to obfuscation but no actual security vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code is benign, with obfuscation being superficial and not malicious. The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n**My recommended scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the overall assessment that the code is harmless but intentionally obfuscated.",
