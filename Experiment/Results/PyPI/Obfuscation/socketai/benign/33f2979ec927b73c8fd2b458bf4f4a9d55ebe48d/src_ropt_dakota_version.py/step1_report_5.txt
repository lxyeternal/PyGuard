  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package with an obfuscated control flow.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignments and a boolean flag controlling import and type aliasing.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no external data, user input, or sensitive information handled.",
  "flows": "Conditional branch determines type aliasing but does not influence execution beyond obfuscation.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable naming, obfuscated control flow, and no clear functional purpose beyond version definition.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up version strings and version tuples with obfuscated variable names. A boolean flag controls whether type annotations are imported and used for type aliasing, but it is set to False, so the alias is just 'object'. This pattern appears to serve as an obfuscation technique rather than functional necessity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The code does not perform any malicious actions or contain suspicious logic beyond obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code primarily obfuscates simple version information definitions using confusing variable names and conditional type aliasing. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The structure appears to be intentionally obfuscated but benign.",
