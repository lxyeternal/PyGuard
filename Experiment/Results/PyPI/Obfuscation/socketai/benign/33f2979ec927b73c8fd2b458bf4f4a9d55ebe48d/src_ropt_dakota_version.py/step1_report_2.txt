  "purpose": "Define version information and conditionally set type annotations based on a flag.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the hardcoded boolean WkEekwJrYFISPOHvZCqlupplnRIFgjsw to determine type annotation assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, no data leaks, and no external system interaction.",
  "flows": "The flag WkEekwJrYFISPOHvZCqlupplnRIFgjsw determines the type annotation assignment; version variables are assigned from hardcoded strings and tuples.",
  "anomalies": "The boolean flag WkEekwJrYFISPOHvZCqlupplnRIFgjsw is obfuscated with a seemingly random name; no other suspicious code or hidden behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a list of exported names and a boolean flag with an obfuscated name. Depending on the flag, it conditionally imports typing constructs and defines a type alias. It then sets version information both as strings and tuples, with all values hardcoded. No external data sources, user input, or system interactions are present. The obfuscated flag and the conditional import may hint at code that is meant to be toggled or obfuscated, but there is no malicious activity or security risk evident. The code is straightforward and appears to serve a versioning purpose with an obfuscated toggle.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily for version management with an obfuscated toggle. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are identified.",
