{
  "purpose": "Define package version info with conditional typing support, using obfuscated variable names for potential code concealment.",
  "sources": "The boolean variable controlling import, the version string and tuple assignments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static data only.",
  "flows": "Boolean check controls whether type hints are imported; static version info assigned directly.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, conditional import based on a boolean set to False, no external data or dynamic behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward: it defines version info with obfuscated variable names and a conditional import that is inactive (boolean is False). The obfuscation appears superficial, serving code concealment rather than malicious intent. No external data, network activity, or user input is involved. The static assignments and conditional logic are benign. The obfuscated boolean variable and variable names do not indicate malicious behavior but suggest code minimization or concealment. Overall, the code is benign, with superficial obfuscation, and no security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, primarily version metadata with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are present. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent, and the static nature of the code confirms its benign purpose.",
