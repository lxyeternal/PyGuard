{
  "purpose": "Defines version information for a Python package with an obfuscated conditional structure.",
  "sources": "Constant string assignment, conditional import based on obfuscated boolean variable",
  "sinks": "Assignment of version strings and tuples; no untrusted data handling or external input processing",
  "flows": "Assignment of version and version_tuple variables directly from hardcoded values",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated boolean variable controlling imports; no actual import when flag is False; no external data handling or dynamic code execution",
  "analysis": "The code primarily assigns version information. It contains an obfuscated boolean variable that determines whether type hints are imported and used; however, since the flag is set to False, the import is skipped, and type annotations are assigned to 'object'. The version info is hardcoded, and there is no data reading, external input, or suspicious activity. The obfuscation seems to be a simple attempt to conceal the structure but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment appears to be an intentionally obfuscated version info definition with no malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial, and there are no signs of malware or malicious data flow.",
