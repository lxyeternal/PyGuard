  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, static metadata definitions, hardcoded email and URL strings.",
  "sinks": "None; no external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> passing static data to setuptools.setup() -> package metadata assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, inconsistent formatting, minor irregularities in string concatenation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script for packaging a Python library, with obfuscated variable names that do not impact functionality but hinder readability. No dynamic input, network activity, or code injection is present. The obfuscation appears stylistic or accidental rather than malicious. Static analysis shows no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The hardcoded email and URL are standard for package metadata. The overall structure is benign, with no suspicious logic or external dependencies beyond standard setuptools usage.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign package setup script with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, malware, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation is likely stylistic rather than malicious, and the overall security risk is minimal.",
