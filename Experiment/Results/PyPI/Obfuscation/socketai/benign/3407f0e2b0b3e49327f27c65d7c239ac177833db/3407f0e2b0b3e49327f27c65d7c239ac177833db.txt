      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion in Reports 1 and 4 due to obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting cautious handling. Benign reports are consistent with their low scores. Slightly increasing Report 4's malware score improves alignment with its suspicious features. The overall assessment confirms the scoring is mostly appropriate, with minor refinements suggested."
