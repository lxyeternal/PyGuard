      "conclusion": "The setup script appears legitimate in functionality but employs obfuscated identifiers, which raises suspicion. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or security risks within this snippet. The high obfuscation should prompt further review of the associated source code and context before deployment. The overall malware score remains low (~0.2), obfuscation is high (~0.8), and security risk is moderate (~0.3), aligning with cautious suspicion but no confirmed malicious intent."
