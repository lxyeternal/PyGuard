{
  "purpose": "Static enum definitions and cryptography module imports, likely part of a cryptographic library or setup.",
  "sources": "Import statements from winrt modules and enum class definitions with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks, external inputs, or network interactions present.",
  "flows": "Static enum definitions without data flow or runtime logic.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and enum names, but no active malicious code or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static enum classes with obfuscated names and import statements. No functions, data processing, or network activity are present. The obfuscation may be intentional for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. Malware scores are zero, and security risk scores are very low, consistent with benign static code. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming but does not imply maliciousness. Overall, the code appears to be part of a cryptographic setup with obfuscated identifiers, with no evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, static, and obfuscated but does not contain malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious in this context. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the static analysis.",
