{
  "purpose": "Defines feature flags, device capabilities, segment and scene codes, and a configuration generator for smart lighting devices.",
  "sources": "Class attributes, constants, function parameters, and static data structures used for configuration logic.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks, network communication, or data exfiltration present.",
  "flows": "Configuration flags and parameters are combined internally to construct device capability objects; no external data flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, but no malicious or suspicious code patterns, secrets, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static configuration setup for smart lighting devices, using bitwise operations and predefined byte sequences. Obfuscated names hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No network, file I/O, or external data interactions are present. The logic solely constructs configuration objects based on input flags, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "This is benign, obfuscated configuration code for smart lighting capabilities. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The high obfuscation score reflects naming complexity but does not imply malicious intent. Security risk remains very low.",
