  "purpose": "Define features, scenes, and capabilities for a lighting system, including functions to generate configurations based on boolean flags and parameters.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from predefined constants, function parameters, and global dictionaries; no external input sources detected.",
  "sinks": "None identified; data is used internally within objects and constants, no untrusted data output or external connections observed.",
  "flows": "Function inputs influence internal feature flags and scene selections, used to instantiate configuration objects; no data flows to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, complex feature flag logic, and extensive static data dictionaries could mask malicious intent but appear as legitimate configuration code.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines feature flags via an IntFlag enumeration, uses bitwise operations to combine features, and creates configuration objects based on boolean inputs and parameters. The large static dictionaries and lists specify predefined segment and scene codes. No user input, network communication, file I/O, or environmental variables are used. The obfuscated naming might be intended to hide malicious behavior but seems consistent with a configuration or SDK pattern. No indicators of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors are present. The code appears to be for configuring lighting features rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a configuration setup for a lighting system with feature flags, scene selections, and predefined constants. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation may be for code concealment but does not directly imply malicious intent. Overall, it appears as benign configuration code for device features.",
