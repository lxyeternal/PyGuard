  "conclusion": "The code exhibits significant obfuscation, which warrants further review of the imported modules to rule out malicious behavior. Currently, there is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation pattern is suspicious. The scores are consistent with a cautious assessment, indicating low likelihood of malware but moderate concern due to concealment tactics."
