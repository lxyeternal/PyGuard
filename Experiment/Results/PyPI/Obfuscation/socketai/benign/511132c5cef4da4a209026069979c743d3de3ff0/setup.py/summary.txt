  "conclusion": "The script is largely benign but employs a pattern ('exec' on external code) that can be exploited if 'version.py' is malicious or tampered with. Obfuscation is superficial. The main security concern is the potential for executing malicious code via 'exec()'. The malware score should reflect this risk, and the overall security risk should be moderate to high if the environment is untrusted."
