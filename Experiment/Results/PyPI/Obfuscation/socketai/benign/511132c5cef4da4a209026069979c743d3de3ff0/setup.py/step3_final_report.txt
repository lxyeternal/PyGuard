  "purpose": "Standard setup script for a Python package, reading README and version info, then configuring package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.rst' for long description; reads and executes 'cxxfilt/version.py' via exec() to obtain version info.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or system modification; only executes local 'version.py' code.",
  "flows": "Reads files from disk; executes 'version.py' content via exec(), which could run arbitrary code if the file is malicious.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; use of exec() on a local file; no validation or sandboxing of executed code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup configuration with heavily obfuscated variable names. The main security concern is the use of exec() on 'version.py', which, if compromised, could execute malicious code. No external data, network activity, or dynamic inputs are present. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The use of exec() is common but risky if the source file is untrusted. The overall risk depends on the integrity of 'version.py'.",
  "conclusion": "The script is largely benign but employs a pattern ('exec' on external code) that can be exploited if 'version.py' is malicious or tampered with. Obfuscation is superficial. The main security concern is the potential for executing malicious code via 'exec()'. The malware score should reflect this risk, and the overall security risk should be moderate to high if the environment is untrusted.",
