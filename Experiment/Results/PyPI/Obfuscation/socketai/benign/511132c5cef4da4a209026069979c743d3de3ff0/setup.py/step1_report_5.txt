  "purpose": "To set up and configure a Python package, including reading files and executing external version data.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.rst' and 'version.py' files, executing the contents of 'version.py'.",
  "sinks": "exec(f.read()) in context of executing external code; potentially executing malicious code embedded in 'version.py'.",
  "flows": "Reading 'version.py' content and executing it directly, which can execute arbitrary code if 'version.py' contains malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() to run code read from an external file ('version.py'), which is a significant security risk if the file is tampered with or malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setup utilities and reads files necessary for package configuration. The variable naming is obfuscated, but no other suspicious code patterns are present. The critical point is the use of exec() on the contents of 'version.py', which can execute any code present in that file, including malicious payloads such as system commands or data exfiltration routines. Since 'version.py' is external and its contents are executed without validation, this poses a high security risk. There are no other signs of malicious behavior, but the exec() pattern is a serious concern for supply chain security.",
  "conclusion": "The main security concern is the use of exec() on external file content, which can execute malicious code if the file is compromised. No other malicious behavior or obfuscation is evident. The overall security risk is high due to this pattern.",
