  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for C++ symbol demangling, with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The primary security consideration is the dynamic library loading pattern, which, as written, is safe due to fixed library names. No malware or malicious activity is detected."
