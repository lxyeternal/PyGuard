  "purpose": "A utility for loading system libraries ('c' and 'stdc++') and demangling C++ symbols using __cxa_demangle, with custom exception handling and obfuscated class/variable names.",
  "sources": "Library names obtained via hardcoded strings ('c', 'stdc++'), used in ctypes.CDLL calls, and symbol data passed to demangling functions.",
  "sinks": "Demangling function __cxa_demangle, dynamic library loading, exception raising based on demangle status codes.",
  "flows": "Library name strings from code to find_library, then to ctypes.CDLL loading, then to __cxa_demangle, with symbol data flowing into demangling functions and error handling pathways.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, no input validation or sanitization, dynamic library loading based on fixed strings, potential for misuse if extended with user input.",
  "analysis": "The code loads 'c' and 'stdc++' libraries via find_library and ctypes.CDLL, then retrieves __cxa_demangle to process C++ symbol strings. It defines custom exceptions with obfuscated names, likely to conceal intent or for obfuscation. Error handling is thorough, raising exceptions for various demangle status codes. No network activity, data exfiltration, or destructive actions are present. Obfuscation is notable but does not imply malicious behavior. The dynamic library loading is based on fixed strings, reducing immediate risk, but if extended to accept user input, could be exploited. Overall, the code functions as a legitimate symbol demangling utility, with obfuscation and standard dynamic library handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for C++ symbol demangling, with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The primary security consideration is the dynamic library loading pattern, which, as written, is safe due to fixed library names. No malware or malicious activity is detected.",
