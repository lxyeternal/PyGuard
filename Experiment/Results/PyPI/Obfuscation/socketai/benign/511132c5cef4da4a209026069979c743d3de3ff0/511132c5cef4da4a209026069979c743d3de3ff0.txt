      "conclusion": "The script is largely benign but employs a pattern ('exec' on external code) that can be exploited if 'version.py' is malicious or tampered with. Obfuscation is superficial. The main security concern is the potential for executing malicious code via 'exec()'. The malware score should reflect this risk, and the overall security risk should be moderate to high if the environment is untrusted."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for C++ symbol demangling, with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious intent or harmful behavior. The primary security consideration is the dynamic library loading pattern, which, as written, is safe due to fixed library names. No malware or malicious activity is detected."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, representing a version assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risk based solely on this snippet. The high obfuscation score is justified but does not imply malicious intent. Scores across reports are consistent and appropriate."
