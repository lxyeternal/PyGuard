      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation and an invalid 'encoding' parameter that would cause a runtime error unless handled. No malware or malicious behavior is detected. The obfuscation warrants cautious review, especially if from an untrusted source, but overall it appears safe."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is highly obfuscated and employs dynamic import and global namespace manipulation, which are techniques often used in malicious or covert code to hide intent and facilitate runtime code execution. While no explicit malicious payloads are present in this snippet, the structure and obfuscation patterns warrant suspicion and further review, especially in untrusted environments. The scores assigned in the reports (malware ~0.7, obfuscation ~0.85, security risk ~0.7) are justified given the code's characteristics."

      "conclusion": "The code snippet is suspicious mainly due to the obfuscated import name, which could conceal malicious code. No active malicious activity is confirmed. The current scores are appropriate, with a slight inclination towards increased caution. Further analysis of the actual modules is recommended before trusting or deploying this code."

      "conclusion": "This is a cryptography utility with significant obfuscation and dynamic features. While no direct malicious behavior is evident, the obfuscation could be exploited to hide malicious modifications. External dependencies should be reviewed, and input validation should be enforced to mitigate potential risks."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated wrapper around 'chardet' for character encoding detection. Despite heavy obfuscation and dynamic import, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects concealment efforts, but the malware score remains zero due to lack of malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, consistent with a utility module."

The current scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is low, obfuscation suspicion is high, and overall risk is moderate. Further analysis of the imported modules and subsequent code execution is recommended to confirm any malicious activity."

No explicit malicious payloads are present, but the suspicious features warrant cautious review. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's characteristics, indicating moderate security concern mainly due to obfuscation and control flow complexity."
