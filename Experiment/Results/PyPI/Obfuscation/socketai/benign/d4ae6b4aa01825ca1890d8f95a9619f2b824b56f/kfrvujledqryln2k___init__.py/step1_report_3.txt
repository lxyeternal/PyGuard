  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system calls are visible",
  "flows": "Data flows from imported modules; no apparent untrusted data flows from external input",
  "anomalies": "The second import uses an obfuscated or non-descriptive identifier 'rbckGAdfclLhZSiwYnBkVPcUACVuMsbr', which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality",
  "analysis": "The code performs two import statements from a package 'pyxk'. The second import uses a complex, non-descriptive name that appears to be intentionally obfuscated. No further code execution, data handling, or active behavior is present. The use of obfuscated identifiers in import statements may suggest an attempt to conceal malicious intent, but with only these lines, there is no definitive evidence of malicious activity. Since the code is minimal and only involves imports, it lacks direct malicious actions, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal and primarily consists of import statements. The second import's obfuscated name could be a red flag for concealment or malicious intent, but without additional context or code, it cannot be conclusively malicious. Overall, the snippet does not show active malicious behavior but raises a suspicion due to obfuscation.",
