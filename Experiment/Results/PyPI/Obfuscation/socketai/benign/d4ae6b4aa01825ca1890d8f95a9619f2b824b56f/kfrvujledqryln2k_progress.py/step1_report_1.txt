{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions for creating progress bars using the 'rich' library, with configurable display options.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input directly; it imports the 'rich' library modules and accepts function parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs and returns 'Progress' objects; it does not write to files, network, or perform any external data transmission.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence the composition of progress bars; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks. The functions generate progress objects locally.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual import alias 'bNjgHsyMYgcexeUqHWHaWKFKRCcnWjGg' used for 'rich' components; no other suspicious or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscated code or hidden behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'rich' library modules with an alias that appears obfuscated but is consistent. Two functions generate progress bar configurations with optional transfer speed display. The functions accept parameters for customization and return 'Progress' objects. There is no external data processing, network activity, or potentially malicious operations. The import alias could be an obfuscation attempt but is more likely an anonymized name. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are present. The functions are purely UI components for displaying progress bars.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, focusing on creating progress bar objects with configurable options. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The unusual import alias does not indicate malicious intent but may be intended for obfuscation or stylistic reasons. Overall, the code appears safe and legitimate.",
