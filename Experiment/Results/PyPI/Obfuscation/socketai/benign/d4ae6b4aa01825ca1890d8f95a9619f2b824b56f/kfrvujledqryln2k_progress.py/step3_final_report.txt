{
  "purpose": "The code defines utility functions to create progress bar objects using the 'rich' library, primarily for UI display purposes.",
  "sources": "The functions read configuration parameters and instantiate 'rich' progress bar components; no external data or input sources are involved.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; the code only constructs UI components locally.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the creation of 'rich' progress bar objects; no external data flows or network interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "The import statement uses an obfuscated alias 'bNjgHsyMYgcexeUqHWHaWKFKRCcnWjGg', and variable/function names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, generating progress bar components with configurable columns. The obfuscated import alias is suspicious but does not indicate malicious activity. No external data, network activity, or security-sensitive operations are present. The functions serve purely UI purposes, and the obfuscation appears to be stylistic or an attempt at concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as UI utility functions for progress display. The main concern is the obfuscated import alias, which warrants caution but does not currently suggest malicious behavior. No malware or security vulnerabilities are evident.",
