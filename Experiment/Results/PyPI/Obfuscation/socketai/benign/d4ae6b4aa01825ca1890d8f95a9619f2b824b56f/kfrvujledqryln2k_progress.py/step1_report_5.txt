{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions that create and configure progress bar objects using the 'rich' library, for visual display in terminal applications.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from function parameters, including booleans and optional string parameters, but no external data sources or untrusted input are explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network, file writing, or command execution are present; the functions only instantiate and return progress bar objects.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into the creation of progress bar objects; no external untrusted data flows into the system; no data leaks or command executions are evident.",
  "anomalies": "The 'rich' library is imported with an unusual alias 'bNjgHsyMYgcexeUqHWHaWKFKRCcnWjGg', which may be obfuscation or code noise but is not malicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code structures are apparent. The import statement includes an undefined or suspicious module name.",
  "analysis": "The code provides functions to create progress display objects with configurable columns and options, primarily for visual progress updates. It does not include data input from external sources, network operations, or command execution. The use of an alias for the 'rich' library is unconventional but not malicious. There are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or sabotage. The code appears to be legitimate utility functions for UI display.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utility functions for creating progress bar objects using the 'rich' library. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The unusual import alias does not suggest malicious intent but could be an obfuscation or formatting choice. Overall, the code appears benign with no security concerns.",
