  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility functions with significant obfuscation and dynamic module loading, which could be used maliciously to hide payloads or dependencies. No active malicious actions are detected, but the obfuscation warrants further scrutiny. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation techniques that could conceal malicious modules or behaviors."
