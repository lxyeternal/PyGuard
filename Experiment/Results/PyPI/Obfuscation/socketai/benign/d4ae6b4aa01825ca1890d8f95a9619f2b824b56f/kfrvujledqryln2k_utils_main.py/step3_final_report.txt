{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for file handling, path manipulation, timing, data encoding, and code parsing, primarily serving as support functions within a larger application.",
  "sources": "Input parameters, file system reads, dynamic module imports via opaque loader functions, regex parsing of code strings.",
  "sinks": "File operations, print statements, dynamic module loading, regex-based code analysis.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and file reads into functions, with potential dynamic code execution or module loading based on imported modules and regex parsing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic module loading with obfuscated loader functions, complex regex patterns for import parsing, inconsistent or placeholder code snippets (e.g., undefined variables in print statements), and heavy variable obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code employs dynamic module loading through opaque loader functions, which is a common technique to hide dependencies or malicious modules. The regex parsing functions suggest code analysis or injection capabilities. Incomplete or inconsistent code snippets (e.g., undefined variables like 'end_time') indicate obfuscation or partial extraction. No network activity, data exfiltration, or sabotage actions are evident. The obfuscation and dynamic import patterns raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The functions themselves are primarily utility-oriented, but the techniques used could be exploited to conceal malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be utility functions with significant obfuscation and dynamic module loading, which could be used maliciously to hide payloads or dependencies. No active malicious actions are detected, but the obfuscation warrants further scrutiny. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation techniques that could conceal malicious modules or behaviors.",
