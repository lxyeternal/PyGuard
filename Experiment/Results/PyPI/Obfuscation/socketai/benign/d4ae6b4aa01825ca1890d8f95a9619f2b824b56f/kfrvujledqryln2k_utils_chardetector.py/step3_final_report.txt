{
  "purpose": "A wrapper around the 'chardet' library for character encoding detection, using lazy loading and obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Import statements, dynamic import via lazy loader, class initialization, method calls on detector object.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks, network activity, or data exfiltration observed; data flows into detector methods and internal functions.",
  "flows": "Source data (input strings) flow into detector methods, which process and return detection results; no external data leaks.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names, dynamic import of 'chardet' via lazy loader, use of obscure variable names, no comments or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a character encoding detector class that wraps the 'chardet' library, loaded dynamically to possibly evade static detection. Obfuscated variable names and dynamic import suggest an attempt to conceal functionality, but static analysis shows no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications. The class provides methods to detect encoding, close the detector, and access detection properties, all internally consistent. The heavy obfuscation and dynamic import are suspicious but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No signs of backdoors, data theft, or malicious payloads are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated wrapper around 'chardet' for character encoding detection. Despite heavy obfuscation and dynamic import, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects concealment efforts, but the malware score remains zero due to lack of malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, consistent with a utility module.",
