  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated wrapper around 'chardet' for character encoding detection. Despite heavy obfuscation and dynamic import, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score reflects concealment efforts, but the malware score remains zero due to lack of malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, consistent with a utility module."
