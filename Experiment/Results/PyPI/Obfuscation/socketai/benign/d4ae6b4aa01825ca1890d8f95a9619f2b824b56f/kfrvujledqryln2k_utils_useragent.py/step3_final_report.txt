  "purpose": "Manages user-agent strings for HTTP headers, allowing selection and customization, with dynamic module loading for dependencies.",
  "sources": "Dynamic import loader functions, user-agent string definitions, and input parameters for user-agent selection.",
  "sinks": "Header construction functions that insert user-agent strings into HTTP request headers.",
  "flows": "Input parameters influence user-agent selection; dynamic modules provide data; header functions utilize selected user-agent strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic module loading via obfuscated loader, complex control flow with infinite loops, and obfuscated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code manages user-agent strings and headers, employing dynamic imports and obfuscated code structures. The infinite loop and dynamic module loader are suspicious, potentially used to conceal malicious behavior or evade static analysis. No direct malicious payloads such as network exfiltration or command execution are evident. The obfuscation and control flow complexity increase the risk profile but do not confirm malicious intent. The low malware score (0.2) is appropriate given the absence of active malicious actions. The obfuscation score (0.6) reflects the use of dynamic loading and variable obfuscation. The moderate risk score (0.4) accounts for potential misuse of these techniques in a broader context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears primarily for user-agent management with obfuscation and dynamic loading techniques that could be exploited maliciously. No explicit malicious payloads are present, but the suspicious features warrant cautious review. The assigned scores are consistent with the code's characteristics, indicating moderate security concern mainly due to obfuscation and control flow complexity.",
