  "conclusion": "The snippet shows suspicious obfuscation but no active malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate; malware likelihood is low, obfuscation suspicion is high, and overall risk is moderate. Further analysis of the imported modules and subsequent code execution is recommended to confirm any malicious activity."
