  "purpose": "Import utility functions and variables from the pyxk package modules.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'pyxk.utils.main', 'pyxk.utils.useragent', and 'pyxk.utils.chardetector'.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, user input, or external communication observed in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No flow of untrusted data from sources to sinks; the code only imports symbols.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers appear to be obfuscated or nonsensical, which may indicate obfuscation or generated code. No actual function calls, data handling, or control flow present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements, importing modules and symbols with seemingly random or obfuscated names. There are no operations, data handling, or functions invoked that could lead to malicious behavior. The imported symbols could be legitimate or malicious, but their usage is not shown, and no suspicious patterns are evident within these import statements alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code only imports symbols from the 'pyxk' package with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks based on this fragment. The obfuscated identifiers may suggest an attempt to hide malicious intent, but without further code, this cannot be confirmed.",
