{
  "purpose": "The code defines multiple data structures (NamedTuples) for organizing data, likely used in a larger application for handling paths, numeric data, and other structured inputs.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources such as network, files, environment variables, or user input are present in this code fragment.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or transmitted; no I/O or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks are demonstrated in this code snippet, as it only contains data structure definitions.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class and variable names, which may be intended to hide purpose or logic. However, no suspicious code patterns such as dynamic execution, cryptic variable manipulation, or hidden behaviors are visible. The code appears to be purely structural.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for data structures with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. The obfuscated naming may be an attempt to conceal intent, but it does not inherently indicate malicious activity. No hardcoded secrets, input reading, or dangerous operations are present. There are no evident vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of data structure definitions with obfuscated identifiers, likely used within a larger, benign application. There is no indication of malicious intent, harmful behavior, or security risks based solely on this fragment.",
