{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple data structures using NamedTuple with obfuscated class and attribute names, serving as data schemas without runtime logic.",
  "sources": "No external data input, environment variables, or data sources; purely class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No data processing, transmission, or external interactions; no untrusted data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths; static class definitions only.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, nonsensical class and attribute names; no functional code or logic; no secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only data schema definitions with heavily obfuscated names, lacking any executable logic, data flow, or external interactions. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network activity, code injection, or data leaks, are present. The obfuscation is notable but not inherently malicious. Malware score is 0, reflecting no malicious activity. Obfuscation score is high (~0.8), consistent with naming. Security risk score is very low (~0.1), given the absence of vulnerabilities or malicious intent. Confidence in this assessment is high (~0.9), based on static analysis of the snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of obfuscated data schemas with no malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation warrants cautious review in a broader context but does not indicate malicious intent in this isolated fragment.",
