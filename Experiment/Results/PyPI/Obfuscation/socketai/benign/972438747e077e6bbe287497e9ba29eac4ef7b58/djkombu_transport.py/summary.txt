  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, transparent implementation of a Django ORM-backed message transport. No signs of malicious behavior or supply chain attack are evident. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate, primarily reflecting potential misuse if Queue models are compromised. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0. Overall, the code appears safe and well-structured."
