{
  "purpose": "Defines Django models for a message queuing system, including Queue and Message entities.",
  "sources": "Input sources include model fields such as 'name', 'payload', and foreign key relations. No external data inputs are directly handled in this code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are the database via model fields and the custom managers (QueueManager, MessageManager). No untrusted data flows explicitly to sensitive operations in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from model fields (user input or programmatically set data) into the database. No external data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious or unusual code behavior, no obfuscated code, and no suspicious network activity present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward Django ORM model definition with localization support. It uses custom managers but does not show their implementation. No user input handling or external data processing occurs here. No insecure practices, malicious code, or anomalies detected. The structure is standard for Django models.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a standard implementation of message queue models with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious or malicious constructs. The overall security risk is minimal.",
