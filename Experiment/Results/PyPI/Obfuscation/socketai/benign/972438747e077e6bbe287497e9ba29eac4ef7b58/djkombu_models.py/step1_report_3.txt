  "purpose": "Define database models for a queuing system with queues and messages",
  "sources": "Imports from Django modules and djkombu.managers",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data flows; model fields are standard",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; models are standard Django ORM definitions",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded credentials, or unusual behaviors observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Django ORM models: Queue and Message, with standard fields and custom managers. No dynamic code execution, no network activity, or hidden behaviors. No malicious or malicious-looking patterns detected. The use of translation functions and model fields appears typical. The imported managers may handle message queueing but are not detailed here and do not show malicious behavior. Overall, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of data models for a queue system.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard Django models implementation for a queuing system without any malicious behavior, suspicious code, or security risks identified. It appears safe based on the given fragment.",
