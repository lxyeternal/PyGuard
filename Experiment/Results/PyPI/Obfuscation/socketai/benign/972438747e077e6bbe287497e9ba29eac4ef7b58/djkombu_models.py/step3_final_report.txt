  "purpose": "Defines Django ORM models for a message queue system, including Queue and Message entities with associated fields and custom managers.",
  "sources": "Model field definitions (name, payload, sent_at), imported managers (QueueManager, MessageManager).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data; payload is stored but not executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input (model creation) into storage; no external data flow or network activity observed.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with standard Django patterns and no suspicious code or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django model setup for message queuing, with no dynamic code, network activity, or suspicious patterns. The payload field could be misused but is not processed here. No hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious code are present. The imported managers are not shown but their presence alone is not suspicious. The security and malware scores are justified as zero, with a low risk score reflecting potential misuse outside this context. The code's simplicity and adherence to common patterns suggest no security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, standard, and free of malicious or obfuscated elements. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications are necessary.",
