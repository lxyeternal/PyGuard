  "conclusion": "The code is a benign Django management command performing routine database maintenance. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The unconventional import is a common pattern and not suspicious. The overall security risk score should be 0, malware score 0, obfuscated score 0, with a very low security risk score of 0.1 justified by the import placement but not indicating actual risk."
