{
  "purpose": "Manage and clean up invisible messages in a Django application using a custom management command.",
  "sources": "The code imports Message model within the handle method, and reads the count of invisible messages via a database query.",
  "sinks": "The code performs a database query and calls a cleanup method on the Message model; no external data sinks or network operations are present.",
  "flows": "The code retrieves data from the database (Message.objects.filter) and then invokes Message.objects.cleanup(), which likely operates on the database records.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no unusual patterns. The import is local within handle(), which is standard for optional dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The script is a typical Django management command that filters Message objects with visible=False, counts them, and then calls a cleanup method. All operations are standard ORM queries and method calls. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, remote network activity, or backdoors. The import within handle() is a common practice to delay import or avoid circular dependencies. No suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward Django management command for message cleanup. It does not contain any malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The logic is standard and safe.",
