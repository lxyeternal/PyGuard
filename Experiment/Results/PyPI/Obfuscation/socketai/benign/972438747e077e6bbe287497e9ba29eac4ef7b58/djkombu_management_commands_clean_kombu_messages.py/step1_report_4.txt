{
  "purpose": "The code defines a Django management command to clean up invisible messages from the djkombu.models.Message model.",
  "sources": "Message.objects.filter(visible=False).count() and Message.objects.cleanup()",
  "sinks": "Database queries and cleanup method, which could affect data integrity or perform resource-intensive operations",
  "flows": "Filtering for invisible messages -> printing count -> calling cleanup method",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious dynamic code, or unusual code patterns observed. The cleanup method is called directly without additional checks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a Django management base class, defines a command with a handle method, and imports a Message model within that method. It queries for messages where visible=False, prints the count, and calls a cleanup method on Message. All operations are typical for a Django app's maintenance task. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, backdoors, or data exfiltration. The code appears straightforward and intended for message cleanup tasks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django management command for cleaning up invisible messages. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It is safe and appears to serve maintenance purposes.",
