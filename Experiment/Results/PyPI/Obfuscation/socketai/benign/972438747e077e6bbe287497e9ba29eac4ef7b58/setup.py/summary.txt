  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with obfuscation and environment-variable reliance. No active malicious behavior or malware signs are detected. The obfuscated package name warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the code is low risk but should be reviewed in context for supply chain security."
