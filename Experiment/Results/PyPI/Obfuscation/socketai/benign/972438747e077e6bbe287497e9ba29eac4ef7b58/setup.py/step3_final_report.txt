  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, performing package discovery, environment configuration, and test execution.",
  "sources": "Filesystem traversal for package and data file collection; environment variables ('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE') for dynamic module import.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic import based on environment variables; sys.path modification; execution of Django management commands.",
  "flows": "Filesystem traversal → package/data collection; environment variables → dynamic import; import execution → test command execution.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated package name 'x0ex6bjbc6v4kvca'; reliance on environment variables for module import; standard setup code with some obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with package discovery, environment variable handling, and test command. The obfuscated package name is suspicious but not malicious. Dynamic import based on environment variables could be exploited if environment variables are manipulated, but this pattern is common in setup scripts. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The reliance on environment variables and obfuscated naming are red flags but do not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate setup configuration with obfuscation and environment-variable reliance. No active malicious behavior or malware signs are detected. The obfuscated package name warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity. Overall, the code is low risk but should be reviewed in context for supply chain security.",
