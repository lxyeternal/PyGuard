  "purpose": "The code appears to perform data processing, initialization, or utility functions without suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables, input functions, stdin, possibly external files or network sources.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writing to files, network sockets, or executing system commands based on input or environment data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user inputs to system calls, network communication, or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscation detected; limited context prevents definitive conclusions.",
  "analysis": "The code shows standard data handling and environment reading with no signs of malicious activity. The lack of explicit network or system calls suggests benign behavior. Confidence is high (0.8). No obfuscation or malware indicators are present. The low security risk score (0.2) aligns with the benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious intent or sabotage. The assessment and scores are consistent with the described behavior.",
