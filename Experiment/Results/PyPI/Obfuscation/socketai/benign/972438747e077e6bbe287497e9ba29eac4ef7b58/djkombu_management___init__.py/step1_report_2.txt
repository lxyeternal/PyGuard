{
  "purpose": "The code appears to initialize some variables, import modules, and perform basic operations. Without further context, it seems intended for general data processing or utility functions.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly visible; no specific input reading functions, environment variables, or user input prompts are present in the visible code.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks such as network connections, file writes, or system commands are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Due to the limited visibility, no source-to-sink data flows are identifiable. The code appears isolated and does not process untrusted data streams.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated sections are detected. The code structure is straightforward and typical for utility scripts.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements, variable initializations, and simple operations. There are no indications of data being received from external or untrusted sources, nor any data being sent to external sinks. The absence of network calls, system commands, or input handling suggests no malicious intent. The code's simplicity and clarity do not raise security concerns. Without additional context or complex logic, no anomalies or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no signs of malicious activity, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, straightforward, and safe for use.",
