  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, network/file operations, external data reads.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file writes, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input) to sinks (network, files), potential data leaks or malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets are minimal or absent, with no evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The assessments are cautious, assigning low malware (0), no obfuscation (0), and low security risk (0.2). Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited information. No suspicious behaviors or anomalies are identified, and the scores are consistent with the code descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The provided reports are reasonable and accurate. There is no evidence of malicious or obfuscated code, and the low risk scores reflect the benign nature of the code snippets. No adjustments are necessary.",
