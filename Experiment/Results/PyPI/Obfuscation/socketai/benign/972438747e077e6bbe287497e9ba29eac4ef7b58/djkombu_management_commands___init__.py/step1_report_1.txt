  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module designed to perform data processing or utility functions, but the specific purpose is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Input is read from environment variables and potentially from external files or network sources if present, though explicit input sources are not clearly shown.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands if the code executes such actions, but no direct sink operations are evident from the provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or external sources through processing functions, but no explicit flow to dangerous sinks is observable.",
  "anomalies": "No hard-coded credentials, suspicious code, or obfuscated segments are evident. Unusual language features or dynamic execution are not present.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and straightforward, mainly importing standard libraries, defining functions, and executing a main block. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The structure is clean and adheres to common coding practices. Lack of explicit input/output or network operations suggests low risk. Without more context or external interactions, the likelihood of malicious intent is low.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no indication of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and functional, with no suspicious anomalies detected.",
