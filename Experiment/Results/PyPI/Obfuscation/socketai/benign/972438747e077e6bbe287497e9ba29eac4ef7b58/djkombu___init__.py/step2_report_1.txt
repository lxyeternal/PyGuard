  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as simple metadata declarations: setting version, author, contact, homepage, license, etc.\n- No input/output, data processing, network activity, or dynamic code execution is mentioned.\n- No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors are observed.\n- The code is static, straightforward, and typical for package metadata.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- **Code presence:** The code snippet only contains variable assignments for metadata; no functions, data flows, or external interactions.\n- **Malware potential:** Given the absence of code execution, external data handling, or suspicious patterns, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation techniques are evident; the code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Security risk:** Since there's no dynamic behavior, data handling, or security-sensitive operations, the security risk should be 0.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and securityRisk scores as 0, which aligns with the code content.\n- Confidence is 1, which is appropriate given the clarity and simplicity.\n- The reports' conclusions are consistent with the code.\n\n**Any inconsistencies or overestimations?**\n- No. The assessments are accurate and reasonable.\n\n**Summary of my own assessment:**\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity or payload.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 — code is clear and straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** 0 — no security risks identified.\n\n**Final note:**\n- The code is purely metadata; it presents no security concern.\n- The reports are thorough and accurate.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nAll scores are appropriate. No changes needed.",
