{
  "purpose": "This code defines package metadata variables such as version, author, contact, homepage, documentation format, and license for the 'django-kombu' package.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from static variable assignments at the module level.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "No data flows exist; the code only initializes static variables without external input or output.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward set of variable assignments serving as package metadata. It contains no functions, data processing, external data reads, network activity, or dynamic code execution. All reports correctly identify this as static metadata with no security risks or malicious intent. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are appropriate and consistent with the code's content. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior, and the code presents no security concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely metadata, with no malicious or security issues. All reports accurately reflect this, and their scores are justified. No modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
