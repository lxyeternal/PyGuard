  "anomalies": "Models with seemingly random, non-descriptive names (XRhGoTwHDcGSIhBjqizBgtBHDQANLRCX, AAIxOFnvpoOsTsgAWEiKdIFeOEyUgEfm) suggest obfuscation or intentional concealment; no other suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports models and registers them to the Django admin site. Model names that appear obfuscated could be an attempt to hide their purpose, which might be suspicious. However, the code itself is straightforward and standard for Django applications. No malicious code, data leakage, or unsafe behavior is present in this snippet. The presence of non-descriptive model names warrants caution but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Django admin registration script with suspiciously obfuscated model names. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this code snippet. The main concern is the use of obscure model names, which could indicate an attempt to conceal malicious models elsewhere in the project.",
