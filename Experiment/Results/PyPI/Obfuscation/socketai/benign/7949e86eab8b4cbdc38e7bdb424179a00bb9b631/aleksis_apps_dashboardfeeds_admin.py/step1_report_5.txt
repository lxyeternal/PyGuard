  "flows": "Import models -> Register models with admin site.",
  "anomalies": "Models have obfuscated or non-descriptive names, which could be suspicious; no other unusual code behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code imports models, including two with seemingly random or obfuscated names, and registers them with Django's admin interface. The registration process itself is standard. The unusual model names may be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply obfuscate. There are no apparent malicious code behaviors such as network calls, file manipulation, or other suspicious activities. The code is minimal and typical for Django admin setup, but the naming could be suspicious, warranting further investigation of the models themselves.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform standard Django admin registrations, but the non-descriptive or obfuscated model names could be suspicious. No direct malicious activity is evident, but model inspection is recommended for safety.",
