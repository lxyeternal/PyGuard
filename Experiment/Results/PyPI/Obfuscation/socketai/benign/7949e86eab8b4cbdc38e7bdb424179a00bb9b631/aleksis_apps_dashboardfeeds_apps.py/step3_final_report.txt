{
  "purpose": "Configuration class containing static metadata, including application info, repository URL, license, and contributor details.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings within class attributes, including names, emails, URLs, and license info.",
  "sinks": "None; static data stored in code, no data transmission or external processing observed.",
  "flows": "Static data assigned to class attributes; no dynamic or untrusted data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name and attribute names; inclusion of personal PII (names, emails) in plain text.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a configuration class with static metadata, obfuscated naming, and embedded PII. No dynamic code, network activity, or code injection present. The obfuscation appears intentional but not malicious. The presence of PII raises privacy concerns but does not indicate malicious intent. No signs of malware such as network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign configuration module with obfuscated identifiers and static metadata, including PII. While privacy issues should be addressed, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
