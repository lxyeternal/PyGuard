  "purpose": "The purpose of this code is not explicitly stated, but it appears to perform some form of data processing, possibly related to network communication or system monitoring.",
  "sources": "Code reads environment variables, input parameters, and possibly network data or file contents.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur via network transmission functions, file writes, or logging mechanisms.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input parameters through processing functions to sinks like network sockets, file outputs, or logs.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious obfuscation detected. Usage of standard libraries is common, and no unusual code structures are present. The code structure appears legitimate and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly from start to finish. It includes standard imports and functions with clear roles. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system damage, or hidden backdoors was observed. The code does not perform unsafe SQL operations, dynamic code execution, or use insecure methods. No suspicious patterns or anomalies were identified. The code appears to be part of a legitimate process, with no indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there are no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues in this code segment. It appears to be benign, with no suspicious activity detected.",
