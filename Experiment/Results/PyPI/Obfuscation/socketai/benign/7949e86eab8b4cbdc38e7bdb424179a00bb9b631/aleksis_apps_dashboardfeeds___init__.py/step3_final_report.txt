  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'AlekSIS-App-DashboardFeeds' package using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "The call to pkg_resources.get_distribution() and access to its attributes.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks; the code only reads package metadata, not untrusted input or data.",
  "flows": "Source: get_distribution() call; Sink: accessing attribute (possibly 'version' or a custom attribute).",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names; access to a non-standard attribute 'tJULNiLOfdRkgCoBgxdSHRLDzkyDNDt' in report 5.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to obtain package version info via pkg_resources, which is benign. The obfuscated variable names and unusual attribute access are suspicious but do not indicate malicious activity. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is evident. The obfuscation suggests concealment, warranting caution. The unusual attribute in report 5 could be used maliciously but currently shows no direct harm.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign, serving to retrieve package info. Obfuscation and unusual attribute access are suspicious but not confirmed malicious. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score around 0.3 due to obfuscation and potential concealment. Further review of the package source is recommended, especially regarding the non-standard attribute.",
