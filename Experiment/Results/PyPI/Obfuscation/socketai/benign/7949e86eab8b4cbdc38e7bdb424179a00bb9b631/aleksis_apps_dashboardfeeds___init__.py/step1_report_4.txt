  "purpose": "Retrieve the version of the 'AlekSIS-App-DashboardFeeds' package or set to 'unknown' if not found.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution() call to access package metadata",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks for untrusted data; the code only retrieves package info",
  "flows": "Input (package name) -> pkg_resources.get_distribution() -> version info stored in variable",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., VmSZZodrUGNlJMnVHRhtnzMInPCyofde) suggest obfuscation; the code does not perform malicious actions but the variable naming is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to obtain the distribution version of a specific package, handling exceptions to assign 'unknown' if not found. The variable names are obfuscated, which is uncommon for benign code, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration or system modification. The use of try-except is standard for robust package info retrieval. No external data sources or dangerous operations are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a straightforward package version check with obfuscated variable names. It does not exhibit malicious behavior, but the obfuscation could be a sign of intent to conceal or avoid detection. Overall, no malicious activity detected.",
