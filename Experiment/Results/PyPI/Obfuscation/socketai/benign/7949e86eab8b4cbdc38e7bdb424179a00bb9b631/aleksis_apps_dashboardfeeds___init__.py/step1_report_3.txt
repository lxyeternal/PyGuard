  "purpose": "Retrieve the version information of the 'AlekSIS-App-DashboardFeeds' package using pkg_resources",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution() call to fetch package info",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no data output or network activity",
  "flows": "Input (package info) from get_distribution to variable assignment",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obscure variable name and indirect access to package data; no suspicious code behavior",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to obtain the distribution details of a specific package. It uses a try-except block to handle potential errors. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which might suggest an attempt to hide intent, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or harmful actions. The code only reads package metadata and does not perform network requests, execute dynamic code, or access sensitive data.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, designed to fetch package version info, albeit with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
