{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to retrieve the version information of the package 'AlekSIS-App-DashboardFeeds' using pkg_resources.",
  "sources": "pkg_resources.get_distribution() call, which reads installed package metadata",
  "sinks": "Assigns to a variable, but no direct data leaks or external outputs are observed",
  "flows": "The distribution version info flows from the package metadata to the variable VmSZZodrUGNlJMnVHRhtnzMInPCyofde",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which could indicate an attempt to hide intent. The code retrieves package information but does nothing malicious explicitly.",
  "analysis": "The code uses pkg_resources to obtain the distribution version of a specific package. Exception handling is in place to assign 'unknown' if the package is not found. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. There are no indicators of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code appears to be benign in function but uses obfuscated variables.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in functionality—retrieving package version info—but employs obfuscated variable names that may suggest an attempt to conceal purpose. No malicious actions or malware indicators are evident.",
