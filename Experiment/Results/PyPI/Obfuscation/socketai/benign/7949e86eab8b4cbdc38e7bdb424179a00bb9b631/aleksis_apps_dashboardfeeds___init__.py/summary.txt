  "conclusion": "The code is primarily benign, serving to retrieve package info. Obfuscation and unusual attribute access are suspicious but not confirmed malicious. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score around 0.3 due to obfuscation and potential concealment. Further review of the package source is recommended, especially regarding the non-standard attribute."
