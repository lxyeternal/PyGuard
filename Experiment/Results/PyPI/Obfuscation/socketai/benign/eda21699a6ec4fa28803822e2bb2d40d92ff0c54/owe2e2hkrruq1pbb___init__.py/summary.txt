  "conclusion": "Based solely on the import statements with obfuscated identifiers, there is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain sabotage. The high obfuscation scores are justified but do not confirm malicious intent. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate given the limited scope. Further investigation should include additional code or runtime analysis to confirm benign or malicious behavior."
