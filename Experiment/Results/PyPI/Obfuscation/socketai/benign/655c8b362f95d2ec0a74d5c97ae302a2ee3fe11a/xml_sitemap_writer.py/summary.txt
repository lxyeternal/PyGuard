  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate sitemap management utility with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware, backdoors, or malicious activity. The low security risk score is appropriate, and the malware score remains at zero. Obfuscation is moderate and primarily affects readability, not security."
