  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package distribution, including reading a README file and defining package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file content.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating untrusted data processing or potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "File read operation (source) is used to load README content but does not flow into any critical sink; the loaded data is not further processed maliciously.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names (e.g., FiwAYdUdvPDZueduEdFkXFhBuycLieAg, ZpiGBHALmFJNaWhJTOIDGalXmGAkgAnF) do not affect functionality but suggest obfuscation or intentional renaming. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code present. No dynamic execution or obfuscation techniques detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup configuration using setuptools, reads a README file with proper encoding, and defines package metadata and dependencies. Variable names are non-descriptive but do not indicate malicious intent. No signs of data exfiltration, malicious logic, or obfuscated malicious code. All operations are typical for package setup scripts.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign setup configuration for a Python package, with no malicious behavior detected. The unusual variable names are likely obfuscation but do not pose security risks.",
