      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and unusual naming, which warrants caution. However, there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity. The suspicious parameter and package name could be used to hide malicious behavior, but further analysis of 'adminfilters' and the purpose of the parameter is needed. The overall security risk is moderate, with a low malware likelihood."

      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated Django admin customization with no concrete evidence of malicious behavior. While obfuscation raises suspicion, static analysis indicates a benign purpose. Continuous monitoring and dynamic analysis are recommended if possible, but current static evidence suggests a low threat level."
