{
  "purpose": "The code is used for setting up a Python package, importing setuptools, defining a version, and calling setup with package details.",
  "sources": "The code reads the version from the 'adminfilters' module via __import__('adminfilters').__version__.",
  "targets": "The setup() function with parameters including a hardcoded package name and version; potential for misuse if parameters are maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Import 'adminfilters' to get __version__, then call setup() with package info, including a hardcoded name and version.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a seemingly random package name 'ys377skz8lklujhp'; parameter 'WJxJbXTussLTTlbInIEOgJkdaSXJVPJJ' is an unusual, nonsensical key with value '1.0.0'; no visible malicious code but obfuscated/unnatural parameter names and values.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a standard setup routine but contains obfuscated and nonsensical parameter names and values, which is suspicious. The retrieval of version from 'adminfilters' is typical, but the unusual parameter key 'WJxJbXTussLTTlbInIEOgJkdaSXJVPJJ' may hide malicious intent or could be an attempt to obfuscate. Overall, no direct malicious activity like network connections or file operations is observed. The main concern is the obfuscated parameters and nonsensical package name, which could be used to hide malicious intent or deceive automated scans.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears primarily as a standard setup script but contains suspicious, obfuscated parameter names and a random package name, which warrants further investigation. No definitive malicious behavior is observed, but the obfuscation and unusual naming suggest possible concealment of malicious intent or sabotage.",
