{
  "purpose": "Assigns a string representing a version number to a variable, likely for package versioning or configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads a hardcoded string literal assigned to the variable 'ArUDWsSdhuiCQBbAHYTsRjKPfXhdNsww'.",
  "sinks": "The variable assignment itself is a sink, but no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The source is the string literal; there are no flows to other parts of the code, no data processing or transmission.",
  "anomalies": "The variable name appears obfuscated, but there are no signs of malicious behavior or suspicious logic. No hidden or malicious code, backdoors, or data leakage observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple assignment of a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no inputs, outputs, or suspicious operations. The obfuscated variable name does not necessarily indicate malicious intent but could be used to conceal code purpose. No other code is present to suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident.",

  "obfuscated": 0.8,
