  "purpose": "Assignment of a version string to a variable, likely part of package metadata.",
  "sources": "Assignment statement setting a string value to a variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name that appears as a random string; no clear context or purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '0.1.3' to a variable with a nonsensical name. There are no imports, function calls, data processing, or external interactions. The variable name does not match typical naming conventions and appears arbitrary, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent, but on its own, it is not inherently malicious. The code is minimal and lacks any functional behavior that could be malicious. Without additional context, this appears as a benign assignment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple variable assignment with an unusual variable name but no evident malicious intent. It appears benign and likely part of larger metadata or configuration.",
