{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes with obfuscated class names and a constructor that passes an original message and additional objects to the base Exception class.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and constructor method (__init__) that takes parameters including a message and additional objects.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted input or data leaks; no network, file, or external system interactions.",
  "flows": "Input parameters in constructor passed directly to Exception superclass without modification; no further data flow analysis needed.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are deliberately obfuscated, and one class contains only a placeholder ('...'), which may indicate incomplete or intentionally concealed code. No actual logic or external data handling is present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of custom exception class definitions with intentionally obscure class names. The __init__ method in one class forwards a message and additional objects to the base Exception class, which is standard practice. The presence of obfuscated class names and placeholder class bodies suggests possible concealment or incomplete implementation, but there is no evidence of malicious code, external data transfer, or suspicious behavior. No source-sink data flow is apparent, and the code does not perform any harmful actions or contain malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated class definitions for custom exceptions, with no indication of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation may be for concealment or code aesthetics, but it does not in itself pose a threat.",
