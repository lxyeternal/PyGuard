  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated exception class definitions with no active malicious logic or external data handling. The high obfuscation score is justified, but there is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The malware score remains at 0, and the overall security risk is minimal. The reports' assessments are consistent and appropriate given the code snippet."
