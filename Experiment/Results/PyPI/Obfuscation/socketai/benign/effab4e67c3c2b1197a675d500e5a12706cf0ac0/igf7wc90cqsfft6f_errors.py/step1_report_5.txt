  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger Python application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and __init__ method; no external input reading or data processing.",
  "sinks": "No apparent data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output points observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes are simple exception subclasses with no active code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and non-descriptive; use of ellipsis (...) suggests incomplete implementation or placeholder code. No actual logic, data handling, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated, non-descriptive names. The __init__ method in one class calls super().__init__ with parameters, but the classes themselves contain no logic or external data processing. The presence of '...' indicates incomplete or placeholder code. No indications of malicious intent, data leaks, or harmful operations. The obfuscation might suggest an attempt to conceal purpose, but nothing inherently malicious is present.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a set of intentionally obfuscated or placeholder exception class definitions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks. The obfuscation alone is not sufficient to conclude malicious intent; the code seems harmless and incomplete.",
