  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated class names for use in Python code.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their __init__ methods, including parameter handling.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data processing, network operations, or external interactions occur.",
  "flows": "Class instantiation and exception raising, which are typical and do not involve untrusted data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are highly obfuscated, and one class has a placeholder '...' indicating incomplete implementation. No meaningful variable names or code comments, which could suggest obfuscation. The code appears intentionally obscure but functionally benign.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four custom exception classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. One class has an explicit __init__ method that simply calls the superclass constructor with passed arguments. The other classes are empty or contain '...' as a placeholder, indicating incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code. There are no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data leaks, or malicious logic. The obfuscation of class names and incomplete class definitions could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply an obfuscation tactic, but there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be primarily obfuscated class definitions for custom exceptions with no malicious behavior or security risks evident. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious activity based on this fragment alone.",
