{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated names, likely for use in larger codebase or modules.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and constructor (__init__) method that calls the superclass constructor.",
  "sinks": "The constructor calls 'super().__init__' with parameters, which could potentially handle untrusted input, but in this code, no actual untrusted data is processed.",
  "flows": "The exception classes are instantiated with message strings; these messages are passed to the base Exception class, but no specific source-to-sink flow is evident here.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are intentionally obfuscated, and the constructor in 'aDsBRrJIMmjGjevsSybjheEZhfiEdjCd' accepts message input but does not process or log it beyond passing to the base class. The other classes use ellipsis, indicating placeholders or incomplete implementation. No suspicious code or behavior such as data exfiltration, network access, or system modification is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes with highly obfuscated names, which could be an attempt to hide their purpose. The primary class includes a constructor that simply forwards the message to its parent class, with no additional logic. The other classes are empty placeholders. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or code injection. The obfuscation may be suspicious but on its own is not definitive proof of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be simple class definitions for custom exceptions, with obfuscated names potentially aiming to conceal their purpose. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment. The code alone is safe but may warrant further review if part of a larger, suspicious context.",
