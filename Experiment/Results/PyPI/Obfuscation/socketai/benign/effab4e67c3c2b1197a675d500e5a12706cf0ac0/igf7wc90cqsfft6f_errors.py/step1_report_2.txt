{
  "purpose": "Define multiple custom exception classes with obfuscated names for use in a Python program.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their __init__ methods, primarily the base Exception class from Python.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input or external data sources; just class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and variable names are highly obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but no malicious code is present. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class declarations inheriting from Exception, with one class defining an __init__ method that calls the superclass initializer with a message and additional arguments. The naming is intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but there is no actual malicious behavior, data processing, or network activity. The code appears to serve as a mechanism for custom exception handling, with obfuscated identifiers. No suspicious patterns such as code injection, data exfiltration, or external connections are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to define custom exception classes with obfuscated names but does not contain any malicious or suspicious behavior. The obfuscation alone is not sufficient to conclude malicious intent; it may be an attempt to hide the purpose, but there are no active malicious actions present.",
