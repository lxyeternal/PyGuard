  "purpose": "Utility class for loading and categorizing nodes from a manifest file, primarily for data pipeline processing.",
  "sources": "Reading the manifest file via the obfuscated function dcqfgfEjuRTRFWFUHXqBetOgsSlvUtAh.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks identified; code operates in-memory without external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the manifest into internal dictionaries filtered by node type, with no external data transmission.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names; no suspicious code or hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a manifest, stores it internally, and provides cached properties to filter nodes by type using external functions. No malicious behavior, code injection, or network activity is evident. Obfuscation is significant but appears to serve proprietary or privacy purposes rather than malicious intent. The code is straightforward and aligns with typical data processing utilities. No vulnerabilities or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate data processing utility with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malware, sabotage, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent and appropriate.",
