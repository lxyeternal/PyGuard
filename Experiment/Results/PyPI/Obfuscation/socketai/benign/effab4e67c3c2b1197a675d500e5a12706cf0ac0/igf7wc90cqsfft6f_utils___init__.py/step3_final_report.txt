  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to load YAML and JSON data from files.",
  "sources": "File input via Path.open() for YAML and JSON files.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data exfiltration points are present.",
  "flows": "File data read -> yaml.load()/json.load() -> return data.",
  "anomalies": "Use of yaml.load() with yaml.FullLoader, which can be risky if the YAML content is maliciously crafted, but not malicious by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file reading and data deserialization with standard safe loaders. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is detected. The use of yaml.FullLoader is generally safe but can execute arbitrary code if the YAML input is malicious. The functions are simple and benign, with minimal security risk if used with trusted data. The primary concern is YAML payloads, which is a known security consideration but does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with a minor security concern related to YAML parsing of untrusted data. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk score should be low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting the YAML parsing concern, but overall the code is safe.",
