{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to load data from YAML and JSON files into Python dictionaries.",
  "sources": "File reads using 'file_path.open()' in both functions.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from 'yaml.load' and 'json.load' functions; potential for executing or processing untrusted data.",
  "flows": "File is opened from 'file_path', then data is loaded into memory via 'yaml.load' or 'json.load'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'yaml.load' with 'FullLoader' is generally safe, but if 'FullLoader' is misused or if the source file contains malicious YAML, there could be risks. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code are present. No dynamic execution, obfuscated code, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for loading data from files into dictionaries. Both functions open the specified file path and parse its contents using 'yaml.load' and 'json.load' respectively. The use of 'yaml.FullLoader' minimizes YAML-specific code execution risks. The functions are straightforward and do not include any network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious commands. No anomalous or suspicious code behavior observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears to be safe utility functions for file parsing. No malicious intent or suspicious behavior detected. Risk of harm is very low, assuming the files being loaded are trusted or validated.",
