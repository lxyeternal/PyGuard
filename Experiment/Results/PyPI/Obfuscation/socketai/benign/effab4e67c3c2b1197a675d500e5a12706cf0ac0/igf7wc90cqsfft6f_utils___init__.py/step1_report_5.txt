{
  "purpose": "The code provides two functions to load data from files, specifically YAML and JSON formats.",
  "sources": "File reading operations using 'file_path.open()' in both functions.",
  "sinks": "Data returned by 'yaml.load()' and 'json.load()' functions, which process untrusted file content.",
  "flows": "The functions read files from provided paths and parse their contents into Python dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code present. Use of 'yaml.FullLoader' is standard but can be risky if loading untrusted YAML (potential for code execution).",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that open and load data from files specified by 'file_path'. Both functions rely on standard library functions for file I/O. 'yaml.load' with 'FullLoader' is generally safe but can be risky if the YAML content is maliciously crafted, as YAML can execute arbitrary code in some loaders. The JSON loader is straightforward and safe in this context. No network activity, obfuscated code, or suspicious logic is present. The code's structure indicates it's meant for data loading rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily providing data loading utilities with no evidence of malicious intent. However, loading untrusted YAML files with 'yaml.FullLoader' can pose a security risk if the data source is untrusted, but this is a common practice and not inherently malicious.",
