{
  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to load data from YAML and JSON files, likely for configuration or data processing.",
  "sources": "File input via file_path parameter in both functions; reading files with open() and loading data with yaml.load() and json.load()",
  "sinks": "Data returned from the functions; no direct data leakage or external communication observed",
  "flows": "Input file_path -> open() -> read file content -> parse with yaml.load() or json.load() -> return data",
  "anomalies": "Use of yaml.load() without restricting to safe loaders is risky; yaml.FullLoader can execute arbitrary code if payload is maliciously crafted",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that read files specified by a Path object and parse their contents as YAML or JSON. yaml.load() with yaml.FullLoader is less dangerous than other loaders but still potentially risky if parsing untrusted data, as FullLoader can execute arbitrary code. json.load() is standard and safe for JSON data. No other suspicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or malicious code detected. No network activity, backdoors, or obfuscation present. The primary concern is the use of yaml.FullLoader, which could be exploited if the input file is maliciously crafted.\n\nOverall, the code is simple data loading utilities with a minor security concern related to YAML parsing.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be straightforward data loading functions with a moderate security risk associated with YAML parsing. No malware, malicious behavior, or significant security threats identified. The main issue is the potential risk from untrusted YAML data, which could be exploited via YAML payloads. No obfuscation or malicious intent detected.",
