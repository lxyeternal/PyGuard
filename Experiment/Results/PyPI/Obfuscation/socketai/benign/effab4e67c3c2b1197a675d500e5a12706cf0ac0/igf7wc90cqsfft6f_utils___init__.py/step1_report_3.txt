  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions to load data from files in YAML and JSON formats.",
  "sources": "file_path.open() in both functions, which reads data from files specified by the input parameter.",
  "sinks": "yaml.load() and json.load(), which parse data from the files into Python dictionaries.",
  "flows": "file_path.open() reads data from the file, then the data is processed by yaml.load() or json.load() to produce dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "Use of yaml.load() with FullLoader is generally safe; no hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code. No malicious behavior detected. No input validation or sanitization observed, but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions for loading YAML and JSON data from files. Both functions open the provided file path and parse its contents. yaml.load() uses FullLoader, mitigating most YAML parsing vulnerabilities. No untrusted data is being sent over the network, no code injection, no suspicious or obfuscated code, no hardcoded credentials or backdoors. The functions are simple data loaders with standard library usage. There are no evident security issues or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions solely to load data from files in YAML and JSON formats. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. The implementation appears safe and straightforward.",
