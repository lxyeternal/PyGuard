{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to load data from files, specifically YAML and JSON formats.",
  "sources": "File input streams opened via Path objects in the functions SZoqpjbKnBChNhPCIjrRwEMIdfzAeFOt and dcqfgfEjuRTRFWFUHXqBetOgsSlvUtAh.",
  "sinks": "The loaded data from YAML and JSON files, potentially used downstream for further processing.",
  "flows": "File streams are opened (sources), data is read and deserialized (potential sink if data is malicious), but no further processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code behaviors such as hardcoded credentials, malicious network calls, or obfuscated code. Usage of yaml.FullLoader is standard and safe when used properly.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions that read and load YAML and JSON data from provided file paths. The functions use safe loading methods (yaml.FullLoader and json.load). No external inputs other than file data are processed. No network activity, command execution, or data exfiltration observed. The code appears straightforward and safe, with no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs basic file reading and data deserialization with safe loaders. There are no indications of malicious or sabotage activity. The functions could be part of a larger application that processes configuration or data files.",
