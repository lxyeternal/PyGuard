  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to a variable, likely indicating a package or dependency version.",
  "sources": "The right-hand side string '0.2.13' assigned directly to the variable.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or security-critical functions.",
  "flows": "Assignment from string literal to variable; no data flow involving external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which is unusual but not malicious; no other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of a single line assigning a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of input handling, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The variable name is unusual, possibly obfuscated, but that alone does not indicate malicious intent. No dangerous functions or data flows are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward variable assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There are no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign.",
