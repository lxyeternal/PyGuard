  "flows": "N/A, as there's only a simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code contains a single assignment with a static version string.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a variable with a hardcoded version number. There are no imports, functions, input/output, or external data interactions. The variable name appears random and does not indicate any malicious intent. The code performs a straightforward assignment, which is typical in version declarations.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, merely setting a version variable with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
