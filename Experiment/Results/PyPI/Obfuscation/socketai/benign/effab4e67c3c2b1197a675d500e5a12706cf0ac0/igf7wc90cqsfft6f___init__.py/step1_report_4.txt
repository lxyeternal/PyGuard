  "purpose": "Retrieve the version number of the 'odd_dbt' package, or return a default value if unavailable.",
  "sources": "Import statement for 'GPNfwtJeBofiJbDSakoSCYZIuVizzbSb' from 'odd_dbt.__version__', and logging warning if import fails.",
  "sinks": "Logging warning could be a sink, but it is only for informational purposes.",
  "flows": "Attempt to import version variable; if successful, return it; if not, log warning and return default.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; dynamic import which could hide malicious code, but here it appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code tries to import a version string from 'odd_dbt.__version__'. If the import succeeds, it returns this version; if it fails, it logs a warning and returns '0.0.0'. The variable names are intentionally obfuscated, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The only operation is version retrieval with error handling. The logging might be a standard warning mechanism, not indicative of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple version getter with obfuscated variable names and standard error handling. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this code snippet.",
