  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and module names; no malicious code or network activity present",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import of a version string, with a fallback to logging a warning and returning '0.0.0'. The obfuscation of identifiers is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection is evident. The import and logging are standard practices. The scores from reports correctly reflect the benign nature: malware score at 0, high obfuscation score (~0.7), and low security risk (~0.2). The obfuscation warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is a benign utility with obfuscated identifiers, and no malicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version retrieval function with obfuscated names. It shows no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation is suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. The current scores are appropriate: malware score 0, obfuscation 0.7, security risk 0.2. Monitoring obfuscation patterns is advised, but immediate concern is unwarranted.",
