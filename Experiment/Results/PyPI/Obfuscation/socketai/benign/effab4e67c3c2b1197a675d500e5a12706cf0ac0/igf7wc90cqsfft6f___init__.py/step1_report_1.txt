  "flows": "Attempt to import version data; fallback to logging and default value if import fails.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and module names; no obvious malicious code functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a version string from a specific module within the 'odd_dbt' package. If the import is successful, it returns this version; otherwise, it logs a warning and returns a default value. The variable names and function names appear intentionally obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to hide functionality. However, the core logic is straightforward: retrieve and return version info or fallback. No malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious payloads are present. The only notable aspect is the obfuscation, which might be used to conceal malicious intent, but based solely on this code snippet, there is no concrete evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version retrieval function with obfuscated identifiers. It performs no malicious actions, and its purpose appears benign. The obfuscation could be suspicious, but without further context, no malicious intent is evident.",
