  "purpose": "Retrieve the version string from the odd_dbt package, or return '0.0.0' if unavailable.",

  "sinks": "Logging warning if import fails; returning version string.",
  "flows": "Import attempt from odd_dbt.__version__ to return statement; fallback to logging and default return.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obscure variable names and function names; no obvious malicious code. The import may be used for version checking, common in legitimate packages.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to import a version string from a module within the odd_dbt package. If the import fails, it logs a warning and returns a default version. Variable names and function names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent. The code performs a simple version retrieval with error handling, which is typical in version management routines. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The only minor concern is obfuscation, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a benign version retrieval function with obfuscated naming. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
