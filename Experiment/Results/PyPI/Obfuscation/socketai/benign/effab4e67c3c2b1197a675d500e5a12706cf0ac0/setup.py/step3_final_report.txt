  "purpose": "Setup configuration for a Python package related to data discovery and dbt integration.",
  "sources": "Static package metadata, dependency lists, and variable assignments; no external input or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; no network calls, file writes, or code execution.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package setup parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, incomplete 'long_description' field, but no malicious code or payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names, likely for concealment. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or embedded payloads are present. The obfuscation appears superficial, and the incomplete 'long_description' seems to be a formatting or editing oversight. Dependencies are common and version-constrained appropriately. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The malware score is correctly assigned as 0, given the absence of malicious activity. The obfuscation score is high (~0.7) due to variable name obfuscation, which is consistent across reports. The overall security risk is low (~0.2), justified by the benign nature of the setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup configuration with superficial obfuscation and no malicious payloads. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No further action is necessary.",
