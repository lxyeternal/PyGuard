  "purpose": "A setup script for a Python package that reads README.md and calls setup() with package metadata.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; variable assignment; setup() function call",
  "sinks": "setup() parameters, particularly the malformed argument line",
  "flows": "File read -> variable assignment -> setup() invocation with parameters",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; malformed argument line 'NMBFQiHbUcKCHclsBNAlYxyViZRdIfyK='text/markdown'' which is invalid syntax",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and a syntactically invalid parameter line. The malformed line appears to be an obfuscation or typo, likely intended to specify 'long_description_content_type'. No malicious code, network activity, or malicious behavior is present. The obfuscation and syntax anomaly are superficial and do not indicate malicious intent but should be corrected for proper execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with superficial obfuscation and a syntax error likely due to a typo. No evidence of malware or supply chain attack exists. The main issue is correcting the malformed argument to ensure proper setup. The overall security risk is low.",
