  "purpose": "Static import of classes and variables from local modules, assigning attributes from an obfuscated object to module-level variables, and defining the public API via __all__.",
  "sources": "Imports from .objects and vznEpVoFlnuEMYLisuxGRVPexGXLaIcB; attribute access from the obfuscated object.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks, network calls, or dynamic code execution detected.",
  "flows": "Static import and assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; no dynamic or external interactions; straightforward static code.",
  "analysis": "The code performs static imports and attribute assignments from an obfuscated object, then exports symbols via __all__. No network, file, or dynamic code execution is present. Obfuscation raises suspicion but is not inherently malicious. The code's simplicity and lack of suspicious operations suggest benign intent. The obfuscation is consistent and likely for code protection or generated code purposes. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or sabotage is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static module setup with obfuscated identifiers, likely auto-generated or protected code. There is no indication of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment. The low malware score (0) and low risk score (~0.2) are appropriate. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious; continued review of the larger package is recommended if obfuscation is pervasive.",
