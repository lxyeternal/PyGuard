      "conclusion": "The code is a static module setup with obfuscated identifiers, likely auto-generated or protected code. There is no indication of malicious activity or security risks in this fragment. The low malware score (0) and low risk score (~0.2) are appropriate. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious; continued review of the larger package is recommended if obfuscation is pervasive."

      "obfuscated": 0.2,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high security risk due to unsafe deserialization with pickle/cloudpickle, which can execute arbitrary code. While no malicious code is explicitly present, the potential for malicious payloads makes this a significant security concern. Obfuscation is minimal but present in function naming. Scores should reflect the high risk, with malware scores increased to approximately 0.6, and overall security risk around 0.8."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated serialization and data handling utilities with no direct signs of malicious activity. However, its complexity and obfuscation could be exploited if misused, especially with untrusted inputs. Overall, it poses a moderate security risk primarily due to potential misuse rather than active malicious behavior."

While no direct malicious activity is confirmed, the obfuscation and reliance on external, opaque modules warrant caution and further review before deployment."
