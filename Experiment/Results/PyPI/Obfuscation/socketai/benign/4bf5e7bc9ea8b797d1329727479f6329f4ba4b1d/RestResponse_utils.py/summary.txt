  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high security risk due to unsafe deserialization with pickle/cloudpickle, which can execute arbitrary code. While no malicious code is explicitly present, the potential for malicious payloads makes this a significant security concern. Obfuscation is minimal but present in function naming. Scores should reflect the high risk, with malware scores increased to approximately 0.6, and overall security risk around 0.8."
