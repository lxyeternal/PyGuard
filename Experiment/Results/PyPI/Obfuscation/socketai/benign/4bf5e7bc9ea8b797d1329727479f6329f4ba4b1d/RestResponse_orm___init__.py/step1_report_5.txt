  "purpose": "The code is exporting the 'sqlalchemy' module for external use, likely as part of a package or library.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a local module named 'sqlalchemy'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks involving untrusted data or external outputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; simply imports and exports a module reference.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a local module named 'sqlalchemy' and exposes it via __all__, which is standard practice for defining public API surfaces in Python packages. There are no signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or unusual constructs. The code's simplicity indicates normal module management without any data leaks, external network activity, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign module that exports 'sqlalchemy' for external use. There are no indications of malicious behavior or security issues.",
