  "purpose": "This code serves as a simple module re-export, importing 'sqlalchemy' from the current package and exposing it via __all__ for external access.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import sqlalchemy' reading the module from the package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the code does not process untrusted data or perform external actions.",
  "flows": "The import source flows into the module's namespace; no data flows to external sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is minimal, straightforward, and follows standard patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module named 'sqlalchemy' and re-exports it via __all__, a common pattern for module exposure. It contains no data processing, network activity, or suspicious constructs. All reports correctly identify it as benign, with no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The assigned scores of 0 for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's simplicity and transparency.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The scores and assessments are accurate and appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
