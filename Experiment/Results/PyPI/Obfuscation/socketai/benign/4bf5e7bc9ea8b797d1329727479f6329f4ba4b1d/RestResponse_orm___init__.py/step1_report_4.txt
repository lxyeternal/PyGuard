{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be re-exporting the 'sqlalchemy' module within the package, likely to simplify imports for users of the package.",
  "sources": "Import statement 'from . import sqlalchemy' which loads the sqlalchemy module from the current package.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code that handle untrusted data or could lead to data leaks or security effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present since the code only imports and defines an export list without processing data.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and straightforward, with no unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements.",
  "analysis": "This code simply imports a module named 'sqlalchemy' relative to the current package and exposes it via the '__all__' list. There are no input sources, no data processing, and no potential sinks. The structure is typical for module re-exporting. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serves as a module re-export, and poses no security risks or malicious intent.",
