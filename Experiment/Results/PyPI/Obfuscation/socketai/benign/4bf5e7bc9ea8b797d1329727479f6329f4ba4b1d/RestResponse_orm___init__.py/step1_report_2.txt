{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be an internal module that imports a submodule named 'sqlalchemy' and exports it via the __all__ list, indicating it is intended to re-export or expose this submodule.",
  "sources": "The code reads the submodule 'sqlalchemy' within the same package or directory.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or untrusted data handling points; the code does not process external input or perform any data output.",
  "flows": "The only flow is importing the internal 'sqlalchemy' module and exposing it, with no data transformation or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and standard for module re-exporting. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code are present.",
  "analysis": "This snippet is a straightforward module that imports another module named 'sqlalchemy' from the current package and makes it available for external use via the __all__ list. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data leakage, or code obfuscation. The simplicity and common pattern suggest benign intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic re-export of a submodule with no malicious or security concern. It appears safe and standard for Python package organization.",
