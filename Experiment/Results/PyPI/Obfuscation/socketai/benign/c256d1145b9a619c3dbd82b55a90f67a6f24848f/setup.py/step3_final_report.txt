  "purpose": "Standard Python setup script for package configuration, reading version, README, and requirements files.",
  "sources": "File reads from local filesystem: VERSION, README.md, requirements.txt",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network or data exfiltration observed",
  "flows": "Reads version info, README content, and requirements, then passes metadata to setup()",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated variable and function names; no malicious code detected",
  "analysis": "The code performs typical setup tasks with obfuscated identifiers. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment but not malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behaviors are evident. The malware score is correctly set to 0; obfuscation score is high (~0.75), reflecting variable name obscurity; security risk is low (~0.2). The analysis aligns with the scores, which are justified given the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. Obfuscation does not imply malicious intent in this context. The current scores are appropriate and justified.",
