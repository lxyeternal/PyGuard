{
  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from files 'VERSION', 'README.md', and 'requirements.txt' located in the package directory.",
  "sinks": "File reading operations and the setup function, which do not directly process untrusted input or output sensitive data.",
  "flows": "The script reads version info and dependencies from files, then passes these to the setup function for package configuration.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, but no suspicious or malicious code behaviors are evident. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup procedures, including reading version and dependency files, and defining package metadata and entry points. The obfuscated identifiers seem to be an attempt at code concealment but do not introduce malicious behavior. No insecure practices or malicious activities are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is safe for use as a package configuration script.",
