{
  "purpose": "This code is designed to set up and configure a Python package named 'b6b3bju9ukc0k3m1', reading version information, requirements, and README content, and defining entry points for installation.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the filesystem: version file, README.md, requirements.txt, and the package's directory.",
  "sinks": "Data read from files is used for package metadata and configuration; no data is sent over the network or written to sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "Version file, README.md, requirements.txt -> package setup configuration; no external data flows identified.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., vYgnMAGQVwIwatHKjDcSYwNOWrLkEasv, ObwgxgDFJRwxQFvAlRNSzifAaxfoUrwz), which suggests intentional concealment. No actual malicious code or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation appears to serve to hinder straightforward understanding rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard package setup routines, reading necessary metadata from files and configuring the package. The obfuscated variable names are unusual but not inherently malicious; they could be an attempt to hide the code's purpose or complexity. No external network activity, credential handling, or suspicious behavior is present. The functions read files and supply data for setup, with no evident malicious sinks. No backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected. Overall, the code appears to be a deliberately obfuscated but benign setup script.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a standard package setup with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident. The obfuscation is likely intended to hinder easy understanding but does not indicate malicious intent.",
