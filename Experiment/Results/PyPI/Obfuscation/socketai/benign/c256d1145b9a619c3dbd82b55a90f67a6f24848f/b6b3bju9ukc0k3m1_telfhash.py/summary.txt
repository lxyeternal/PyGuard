  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate ELF analysis utility with obfuscation techniques to hinder analysis. There is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage from static inspection. The obfuscation warrants caution, but the core functionality aligns with benign ELF analysis tools. The malware score is low (around 0.1-0.4), and overall security risk is low (around 0.2-0.3). Further dynamic or manual review is recommended if used in sensitive environments."
