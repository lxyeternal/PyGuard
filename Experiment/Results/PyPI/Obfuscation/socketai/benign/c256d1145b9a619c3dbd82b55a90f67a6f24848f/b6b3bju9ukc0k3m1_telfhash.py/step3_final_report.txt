  "purpose": "ELF analysis, telfhash computation, grouping for malware/similarity detection.",
  "sources": "Reads version info, ELF files, environment data, symbols, sections, disassembly routines.",
  "sinks": "Outputs to stdout/files, processes ELF segments and symbols, computes hashes.",
  "flows": "ELF parsing -> symbol extraction/disassembly -> hash computation -> grouping -> output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, strange import statements, nonsensical code snippets, suspicious string patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard ELF analysis, hashing, and grouping functions. Heavy obfuscation and nonsensical code segments are present, indicating deliberate obfuscation. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are detected. The core routines are consistent with legitimate ELF analysis tools, but the obfuscation raises suspicion. The suspicious code and variable names suggest possible sabotage or malicious intent, especially in the most obfuscated parts.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a legitimate ELF analysis utility with obfuscation techniques to hinder analysis. There is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage from static inspection. The obfuscation warrants caution, but the core functionality aligns with benign ELF analysis tools. The malware score is low (around 0.1-0.4), and overall security risk is low (around 0.2-0.3). Further dynamic or manual review is recommended if used in sensitive environments.",
