  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the absence of actual code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No code provided; all observations are based on the lack of code.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report correctly notes that no analysis is possible due to missing code. The scores (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0) are appropriate.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** The zero scores are justified given the absence of evidence.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues; the report is accurate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No actual code, only general statements.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report assigns a security risk of 0.2, which is somewhat cautious but not unreasonable given the lack of code. Malware score remains 0.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** Given no evidence, the low risk score is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** The reasoning is cautious but justified; no changes needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No code, just assumptions about benign behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report assigns a security risk of 0.3, slightly higher than previous, but still cautious. Malware score remains 0.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** Without code, a risk score above 0.2 seems slightly high but not unreasonable if the reviewer considers potential hidden issues.\n- **Conclusion:** The assessment seems fair; no change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No code, only general analysis.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The report assigns a risk of 0.2, which is reasonable given the lack of suspicious activity.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** The high confidence (0.9) in benignity aligns with the reasoning.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate; no adjustments necessary.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** No code, only general assessment.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** The risk score is 0.2, consistent with the cautious approach.\n- **Score Reasonableness:** Justified given the lack of suspicious patterns.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n\n- All reports correctly acknowledge the absence of code and refrain from assigning high malware or obfuscated scores.\n- The risk scores are generally low, reflecting the limited information.\n- The reasoning is cautious and appropriate, with no overestimations of malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\nGiven the consistent pattern across all reports, my own assessment would be:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code or behavior)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no signs of obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (very low, mainly due to lack of information, but acknowledging that the absence of code prevents definitive conclusions)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are reasonable and cautious. No evidence suggests malicious or obfuscated code, and the low risk scores reflect this.",
