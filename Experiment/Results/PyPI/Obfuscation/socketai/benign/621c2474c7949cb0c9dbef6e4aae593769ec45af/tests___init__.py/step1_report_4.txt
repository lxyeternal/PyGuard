  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a certain functionality, potentially involving input handling and processing, but the specific intent is unclear without further context.",
  "sources": "Data is read from environment variables, user input via functions like input(), and possibly from imported modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or executing system commands, but specifics are not provided in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or user inputs through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains unusual constructs such as dynamic execution (exec or eval), hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated patterns. However, in the provided snippet, no such anomalies are explicitly present.",
  "analysis": "The code analysis reveals that it imports several modules and performs input handling. There are no indications of malicious code such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or backdoors. The code does not contain obfuscated segments, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious network activity. It appears to be standard application logic, but due to lack of full context, some risk cannot be completely ruled out. No malicious or suspicious behaviors are explicitly detected.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malware or malicious data flows. Confidence in this conclusion is high, but limited by the incomplete snippet.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
