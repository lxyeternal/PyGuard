  "conclusion": "The reports are reasonable and cautious, accurately reflecting the absence of code and malicious indicators. The scoring is consistent with the evidence (or lack thereof). Given the missing code snippets, the assessments are inherently limited but appropriately conservative. No modifications are necessary; the overall security posture appears benign based on available information."
