  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of an open source Python dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code input, data reading functions, environment variables, network connections, data flows, hardcoded secrets.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points, system commands.",
  "flows": "From data sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, files, system calls).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code snippets; no suspicious patterns or hardcoded secrets; no obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code, limiting detailed analysis. They correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, and significant security issues. Scores assigned are low, reflecting minimal risk, with slight variations in confidence levels. The reasoning is cautious and appropriate given the incomplete information. No suspicious behaviors or indicators of sabotage are evident. The risk scores are conservatively set around 0.1 to 0.2, aligning with the lack of concrete evidence. Malware and obfuscation scores are consistently zero, which is justified.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are reasonable and cautious, accurately reflecting the absence of code and malicious indicators. The scoring is consistent with the evidence (or lack thereof). Given the missing code snippets, the assessments are inherently limited but appropriately conservative. No modifications are necessary; the overall security posture appears benign based on available information.",
