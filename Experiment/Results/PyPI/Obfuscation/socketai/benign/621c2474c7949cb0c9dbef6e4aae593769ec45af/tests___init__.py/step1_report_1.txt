  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly clear as no code has been provided. Typically, such scripts are intended for data processing, system interaction, or package functionality.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reading points are present in the provided code (no code supplied).",
  "sinks": "No sinks or points where untrusted data could lead to data leaks or effects are present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are identifiable due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are observable without actual code. Cannot evaluate for hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "Due to the absence of code, no step-by-step analysis is possible. In general, an evaluation would involve examining the code structure, looking for suspicious patterns such as hardcoded credentials, malicious network activity, or obfuscated code. Without actual code, these assessments cannot be performed.",
  "conclusion": "No code provided to analyze; therefore, no malicious behavior, anomalies, or security risks can be identified. The code appears absent, and no assessment is possible.",
