{
  "purpose": "Defines a class for collecting and concatenating output data, and exports certain functions/classes.",
  "sources": "Imports from 'qirrunner._native', specifically 'run' and 'Output'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks present; no untrusted data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "Imported 'Output' object is appended as string to internal list, then concatenated to form a string.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears obfuscated or nonsensical; no obvious malicious logic. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behaviors. No network operations, file operations, or environmental data access.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from a native module, then defines a class with an internal list for storing string representations of 'Output' objects. The class provides methods to add outputs and retrieve the combined output. No dynamic code execution, no data exfiltration, and no suspicious behavior are evident. The class seems designed for output handling without malicious intent. The obfuscated class name may be suspicious but could be placeholder or auto-generated. No malicious patterns detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign output collection class with no signs of malicious behavior. The obfuscated class name is unusual but not necessarily malicious. Overall, there is no indication of malware or security risks.",
