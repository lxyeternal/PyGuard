{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for handling output collection from a module named 'qirrunner._native' and exposes certain functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'run' and 'Output' from 'qirrunner._native'. No other input sources are present within this snippet.",
  "sinks": "The code converts 'Output' objects to strings and stores them internally; no sinks directly process untrusted data beyond storage. No network, file, or external system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Input 'Output' objects are converted to strings and appended to internal list; then concatenated and returned as a string. The flow appears straightforward without external data flows.",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are obfuscated or nonsensical, which could indicate attempts to conceal purpose. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from an external module, then defines a class with methods to store and retrieve output data. The methods perform simple appending and joining operations. The class name and method names appear deliberately obfuscated, which may suggest concealment. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations are present. The code appears benign but suspicious in naming, potentially as an attempt to evade detection.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign-looking output handler with obfuscated identifiers, likely for internal use. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident in this isolated snippet.",
