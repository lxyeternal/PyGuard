  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a testing harness with obfuscated modules and native calls. No direct malicious activity is evident, but obfuscation and native code reliance justify a cautious approach. The malware score is set at 0.2, obfuscation at 0.6, and security risk at 0.3, reflecting a low but cautious threat assessment."
