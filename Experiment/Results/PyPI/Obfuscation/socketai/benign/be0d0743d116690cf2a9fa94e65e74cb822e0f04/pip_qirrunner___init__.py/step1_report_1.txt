{
  "purpose": "Defines a class to collect and concatenate output objects, and re-exports certain functions and classes from a native module.",
  "sources": "Import from 'qirrunner._native' module, and internal class methods that handle output objects.",
  "sinks": "The method 'aBEYTDcaBhHsnNaviTlpZlAQgVIXYsFl' appends stringified output to an internal list; the method 'kjzebxSuqNhSgxcyvFZKNZpeGJeGeLdz' joins and returns the accumulated output.",
  "flows": "Input 'Output' objects are received and converted to strings, stored internally, then concatenated for output.",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which may indicate an attempt to obscure intent. The code simply collects and returns output; no apparent malicious activity is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions and classes from a native module, possibly written in a lower-level language. It defines a class that accumulates output objects by converting them to strings and provides a method to retrieve the combined output. The naming is intentionally obfuscated, but the functionality appears to be straightforward collection and retrieval of output data. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The use of obfuscated names alone does not confirm malicious intent, but it warrants cautious interpretation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple output collector with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected. It appears to be a benign utility class, possibly used within a larger framework.",
