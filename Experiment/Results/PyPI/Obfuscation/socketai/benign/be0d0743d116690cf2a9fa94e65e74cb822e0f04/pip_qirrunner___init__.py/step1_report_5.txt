  "purpose": "Define a class to collect and concatenate output objects, and expose specific functions and classes for external use.",
  "sources": "Import from 'qirrunner._native'; class constructor; method aBEYTDcaBhHsnNaviTlpZlAQgVIXYsFl that appends string representations of 'Output' objects",
  "sinks": "Concatenation of stored outputs; potential exposure of collected data through kjzebxSuqNhSgxcyvFZKNZpeGJeGeLdz method",
  "flows": "Input 'Output' objects → appended as strings to _output list → concatenated and returned",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are obfuscated and non-descriptive; no apparent malicious activity, but the obfuscation raises suspicion about concealment",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'run' and 'Output' from a native module, suggesting potential integration with external native code. The class is designed to store outputs and provide a method to retrieve the combined string. The method names are obfuscated, which is often used to conceal intent, but there are no evident malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection. The code appears to be a simple output collector with obfuscated identifiers, which could be benign or malicious depending on context. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors are evident. The exposure of concatenated output may pose privacy concerns if used maliciously, but it alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an output collection utility with obfuscated naming. It does not contain explicit malicious behavior or malware indicators but the obfuscation warrants cautious review in the broader project context. No immediate security risks are evident from this fragment alone.",
