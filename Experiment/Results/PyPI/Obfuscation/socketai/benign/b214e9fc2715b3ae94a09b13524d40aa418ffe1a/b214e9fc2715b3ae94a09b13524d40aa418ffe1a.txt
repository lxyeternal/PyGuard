      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of 'import *' introduces a minor namespace pollution risk but does not constitute malicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) to reflect the import style concerns."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is a heavily obfuscated, auto-generated wrapper around a YAML processing library, with no evidence of malicious behavior or active security threats. Its primary concern is obfuscation, which complicates analysis but does not imply malicious intent. The supply chain risk is low, but source verification and further review of the underlying library are recommended before deployment in security-sensitive contexts."

      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, obfuscated version info declaration with no malicious behavior. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score approximately 0.75, and low security risk (~0.1). The code does not present any active security concerns."
