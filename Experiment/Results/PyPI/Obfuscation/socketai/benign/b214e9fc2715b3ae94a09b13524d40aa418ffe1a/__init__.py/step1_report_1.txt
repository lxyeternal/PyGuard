{
  "purpose": "The code imports modules or functions from the 'ryml' package and a local 'version' module, likely for data processing or version management.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'ryml.ryml' and local '.version' module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing actions are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable in this minimal code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal and appears to be standard import statements. No hardcoded secrets, unusual code, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements, which are common in Python modules. There are no input operations, no untrusted data sources, and no code execution or data handling logic present. The use of relative imports suggests this is part of a larger package. The overall structure is typical and does not raise any immediate security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of import statements with no malicious behavior or security risks detected in this fragment.",
