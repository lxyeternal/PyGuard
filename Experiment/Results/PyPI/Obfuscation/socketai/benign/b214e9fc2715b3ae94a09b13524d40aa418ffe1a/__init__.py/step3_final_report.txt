  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of the provided Python import code, focusing on potential malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'ryml.ryml' and '.version', which read external modules.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted input or execute data flows that could lead to vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; only static import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' in some instances, which can cause namespace pollution and potential supply chain risks if modules are compromised.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with no executable logic, data processing, or suspicious patterns. The wildcard import ('import *') is discouraged but not inherently malicious; it can pose namespace pollution and potential security concerns if the imported module is compromised. The overall confidence in benignity is high, but the wildcard import warrants a slight increase in perceived risk. No data flow or malicious activity is detected, and the code is straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of 'import *' introduces a minor namespace pollution risk but does not constitute malicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) to reflect the import style concerns.",
