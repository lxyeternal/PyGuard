  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of import statements with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The use of 'import *' introduces a minor namespace pollution risk but does not constitute malicious activity. The overall security risk is minimal, with a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and a slightly elevated risk score (~0.2) to reflect the import style concerns."
