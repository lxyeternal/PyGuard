  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, with an obfuscated conditional block that may alter type annotations based on a flag.",
  "sources": "Reading the boolean flag 'WbeXlufEttvPBVGeskCgvdqxQHkVeNBI' to determine type annotation behavior.",
  "sinks": "Assignments of version string and version tuple; no untrusted data handling or external input sources present.",
  "flows": "The boolean flag controls the type annotations; static assignment of version data. No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of highly obfuscated variable names and conditional code that appears to be a deliberate obfuscation or placeholder; no active malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code sets version information variables for a Python package, with an obfuscated boolean flag controlling whether certain type annotations are used. The flag is hardcoded as False, so the conditional block is skipped, and type annotations default to 'object'. The version strings are statically assigned, with no external input or dynamic data. The obfuscation appears intentional but benign, aimed at complicating readability. No malicious patterns, such as network activity, credential handling, or backdoors, are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a version declaration with obfuscated variable names and no malicious behavior. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent but reduces code clarity. Overall security risk is low.",
