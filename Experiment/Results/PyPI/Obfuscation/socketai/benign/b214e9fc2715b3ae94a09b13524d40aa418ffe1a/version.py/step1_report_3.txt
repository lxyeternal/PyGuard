  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package with conditional type annotations.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuple, conditional import based on a boolean flag.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no untrusted data handling, no external network or file operations.",
  "flows": "Conditional import affects type annotation variable, but no data flows from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, a hardcoded boolean flag that could control behavior, but no malicious activity or backdoors evident.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes version information for a package. It includes a boolean variable with a random, obfuscated name set to False, which controls whether certain typing imports and type annotations are included. The variable names are nonsensical and suggest obfuscation, but there is no indication of malicious intent. The version variables are set to a string and a tuple with version details, standard for package metadata. No external input handling, network activity, or malicious code execution is present. The structure appears to be intentionally obfuscated but harmless.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be an obfuscated, harmless version declaration snippet with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
