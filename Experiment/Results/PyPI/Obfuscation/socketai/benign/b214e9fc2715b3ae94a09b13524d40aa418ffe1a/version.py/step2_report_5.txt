  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**General observations:**\n\n- The code snippets are simple version definitions with obfuscated variable names.\n- The boolean flag controls whether certain type annotations are imported or used.\n- The flag is hardcoded as False in all cases, so the conditional blocks are inactive.\n- No external input, network activity, or data processing occurs.\n- No malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious behavior are evident.\n- The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or code concealment rather than malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 1**\n\n- **Purpose:** Define version info with obfuscated conditional import.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\n**Verdict:** The assessment is accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 2**\n\n- **Purpose:** Version info with obfuscated conditional block.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, just obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 (low risk)\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. The low risk score is appropriate given the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 3**\n\n- **Purpose:** Version info with conditional import based on a boolean flag.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious behavior; obfuscation is superficial.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate. No malicious activity, just obfuscation.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 4**\n\n- **Purpose:** Version info with obfuscated control flow, potential for malicious use.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** Although the conditional could be exploited if the boolean is changed, in this static code, it is inactive. No malicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (slightly higher due to potential misuse if altered)\n\n**Verdict:** The score is acceptable. The code's structure could be misused if the boolean flag is changed, but as is, it’s benign.\n\n---\n\n### **Issue 5**\n\n- **Purpose:** Version info with obfuscated variable names and redundant conditional.\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Analysis:** No malicious activity, only obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1\n\n**Verdict:** Correct. No security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary of scoring consistency:**\n\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malware.\n- The obfuscation is superficial, intended to hinder readability but not malicious.\n- The risk scores are low, reflecting the benign nature.\n- The malware scores are zero across all reports, which is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8 (high obfuscation, but benign)\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (low, due to obfuscation and conditional complexity but no real threat)\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The code is primarily obfuscated version metadata with no active malicious behavior.\n- The conditional blocks and obfuscated variable names seem intended to complicate static analysis but do not perform any malicious actions.\n- The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's actual behavior.\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are accurate in their assessment. No changes needed.",
