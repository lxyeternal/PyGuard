{
  "purpose": "Define version information with obfuscated variable names and conditional type annotations, controlled by a static boolean flag.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuples, conditional import of typing aliases based on a hardcoded boolean.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment without external input.",
  "flows": "Version variables assigned directly; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, redundant conditional blocks that are inactive due to hardcoded False, which could be used to hide malicious code if altered.",
  "analysis": "The code is a benign version metadata snippet with obfuscation for concealment. The conditional import and variable assignments are static and do not perform any malicious actions. The obfuscation reduces readability but does not indicate malicious intent. No external data or network activity is present. The obfuscated flag is fixed as False, rendering the conditional blocks inert. Overall, the code poses no security threat, but the obfuscation could be exploited if the code is modified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a harmless, obfuscated version info declaration with no malicious behavior. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious purposes. The scores are consistent: malware score 0, obfuscated score approximately 0.75, and low security risk (~0.1). The code does not present any active security concerns.",
