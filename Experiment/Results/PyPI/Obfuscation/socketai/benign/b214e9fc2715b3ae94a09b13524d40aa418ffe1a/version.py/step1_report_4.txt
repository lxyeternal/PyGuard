  "purpose": "Define version information with an obfuscated control flow that could be used for conditional behavior.",
  "sources": "Reads no external input or data; only assigns static values.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to security vulnerabilities.",
  "flows": "No data flows from untrusted sources to sinks; the code only assigns static, hardcoded values.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names and a conditional block controlled by a hardcoded boolean flag. The flag is set to False, so the conditional block is skipped, but its existence is suspicious and could be used for malicious purposes if altered.",
  "analysis": "The code sets a flag to False, which causes it to skip a type alias import and define a version string and tuple with obfuscated variable names. The obfuscated control flow and variable names are unusual for typical package metadata. The version information is hardcoded and static. The conditional block could be a backdoor or malicious payload if the boolean is changed at runtime or in altered versions, but in this code, it is inactive. Overall, the code appears to be simple version metadata with obfuscation, with no clear malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily obfuscated version metadata with no active malicious actions. The obfuscation and conditional structure could be used to hide malicious code if modified, but in its current state, it is benign.",
