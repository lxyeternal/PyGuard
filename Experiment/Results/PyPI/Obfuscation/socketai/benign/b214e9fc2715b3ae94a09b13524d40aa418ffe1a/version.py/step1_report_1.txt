  "purpose": "Define version information for a Python package, with an obfuscated conditional import.",
  "sources": "Assignment of version strings and tuple, conditional import based on obfuscated boolean flag.",
  "sinks": "None apparent; no untrusted data processing or external data output.",
  "flows": "The version variables are set directly; no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, conditional import that does nothing in the current context, no actual malicious activity or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines version metadata with intentionally obfuscated variable names. The boolean flag controls whether typing aliases are imported, but the flag is set to False, making the import unnecessary. The version variables are assigned static strings and tuples. No input is read, no data leaks, no external network activity, and no malicious code present. The obfuscation appears to be for code concealment rather than malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple version definition with obfuscation and does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely intended to obscure version info or deter straightforward analysis but does not perform any malicious actions.",
