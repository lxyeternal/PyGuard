  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code snippets, input data, environment variables, network or file operations, dynamic execution points (eval, exec).",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "From sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file system, possibly via dynamic code execution.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, suspicious dynamic execution, obfuscation indicators, hardcoded secrets, or network activity suspicion.",
  "analysis": "Most reports indicate missing or minimal code, leading to low suspicion. Report 3 mentions potential dynamic execution and obfuscation, which are noted but not confirmed. Scores are generally aligned with evidence: zero or minimal for benign cases, moderate suspicion in Report 3. Confidence levels reflect the certainty based on available data. No concrete malicious activity or obfuscation is observed; suspicion remains speculative. The scoring is consistent with the evidence, with adjustments to reflect minimal risk in absence of code and moderate suspicion where mentioned.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates negligible malicious activity across the reports. Suspicion in Report 3 is reasonable but not confirmed. Scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence; no significant revisions needed.",
