{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class with methods for handling astronomical detector data, including loading wavelength solutions, plotting sensitivity, and converting flux measurements.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from files (e.g., FITS files), user-provided flux quantities, and load functions like 'load_vega'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive sinks include plotting functions and calculations that process flux data, but no network communication, file writing, or data exfiltration is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from file input ('fits.open'), function parameters (flux, average flux), and load functions through calculations, plotting, and returning processed quantities. No suspicious or hidden flows are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. Use of obfuscated or misleading variable names is present but not malicious. No evidence of malicious backdoors, data leaks, or hidden behaviors. The code appears straightforward, with normal astronomical data processing functions.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily deals with loading data from FITS files, plotting sensitivity curves, and converting flux values with proper unit handling. There is careful validation of units for flux and magnitude inputs. No network activity, file writing, or data exfiltration code exists. Variable names are obscure but not indicative of malicious intent. The logic follows expected astronomical data processing patterns, with no suspicious control flow or obfuscated code segments. Overall, the code appears legitimate and focused on data analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard astronomical data analysis class with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It processes detector data, plots sensitivities, and performs flux conversions securely. No indicators of malware or security risks are present.",
