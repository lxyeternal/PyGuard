{
  "purpose": "This code provides a class with methods for handling astronomical data, plotting, sensitivity calculations, and magnitude conversions related to spectral data analysis.",
  "sources": "Reads data from FITS files, environment variables, input parameters for methods, and file system checks for FITS data files.",
  "sinks": "Uses plotting functions and performs calculations with data, but no untrusted data is sent over network or written to files.",
  "flows": "Data flows from FITS file reading to attribute setting; input parameters influence calculations; plotting functions visualize internal data; no evident data leaks or external data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code observed. The code performs standard scientific calculations and plotting. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are present. No suspicious network activity or malicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class with methods for reading spectral data from FITS files, plotting spectra, calculating sensitivities, and converting flux/magnitude data. It uses standard libraries and performs calculations typical for astronomical data processing. There are input validation checks for units, proper file existence checks, and data handling consistent with scientific practices. No signs of malicious activity, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, are present. The code appears to be part of an astronomical data analysis pipeline with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears legitimate, intended for scientific spectral data analysis, with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain attacks. It adheres to expected practices for data handling, plotting, and calculation in an astronomical context.",
