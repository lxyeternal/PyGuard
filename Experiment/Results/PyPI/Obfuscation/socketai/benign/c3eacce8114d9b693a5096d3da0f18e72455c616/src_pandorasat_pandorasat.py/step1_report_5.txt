  "purpose": "Declare function arguments related to IRDetector classes for different components (NIRDA, VISDA, Optics, Orbit).",
  "sources": "None present; only argument annotations.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing or output involved.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "The snippet appears to be a fragment of function documentation or a signature with parameter annotations. No executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code fragment consists solely of argument labels and class references, likely part of a function or method signature. No actual implementation, data processing, or external data input occurs here. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, data leaks, or unusual activity. The absence of code logic or operations limits the scope of risk assessment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, merely documenting parameters with no executable content or suspicious patterns. It does not pose any security risk or malware threat.",
