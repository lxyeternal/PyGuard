  "purpose": "Define parameters for IRDetector classes related to NIRDA, VISDA, Optics, and Orbit properties.",
  "sources": "No data input sources are evident in this snippet; only variable annotations.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data output points are present in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; this is merely variable annotation.",
  "anomalies": "Code contains only parameter annotations without actual implementation, data handling, or logic. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious constructs are visible.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a simple set of parameter annotations for class attributes, likely part of a class or function signature. It does not include any executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security issues in this fragment. The code appears benign and standard for defining class properties.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is safe, consisting solely of parameter annotations without any malicious or suspicious content. No security risks or malware indicators are present.",
