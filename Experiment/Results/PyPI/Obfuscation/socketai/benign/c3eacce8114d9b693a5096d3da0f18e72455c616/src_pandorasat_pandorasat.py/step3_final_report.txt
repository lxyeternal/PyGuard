  "purpose": "Parameter declarations for IRDetector instances representing different properties (NIRDA, VISDA, Optics, Orbit).",
  "sources": "Function or class constructor arguments where IRDetector objects are passed as parameters.",
  "sinks": "None; the code does not process untrusted data or perform data leaks.",
  "flows": "Parameter inputs to the constructor or function, with no internal data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns; purely argument annotations with no executable logic.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is a straightforward list of parameter declarations for IRDetector objects, likely part of a class or function signature. There are no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, securityRisk: 0 or 0.1) are appropriate given the benign and declarative nature of the code. The high confidence scores are justified, and no anomalies or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of parameter declarations with no executable logic or malicious intent. The security and malware scores are correctly assigned as zero, and the overall risk is negligible. The reports accurately reflect the benign nature of this code snippet.",
