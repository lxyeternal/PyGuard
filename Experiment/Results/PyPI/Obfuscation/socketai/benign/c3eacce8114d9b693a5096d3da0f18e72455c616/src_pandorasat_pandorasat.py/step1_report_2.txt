{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define function parameters related to infrared detectors (NIRDA, VISDA, Optics, Orbit), likely for a larger application involving IR sensor data processing.",
  "sources": "None in the provided snippet, as it only shows argument declarations.",
  "sinks": "None in the provided snippet; no data processing or output operations are shown.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be inferred from the snippet since it's only parameter definitions.",
  "anomalies": "There are no signs of unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs in this fragment.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is limited to argument annotations for a function or method, indicating the use of IRDetector class instances for different properties. No suspicious behavior, code injection, or malicious patterns are visible. The code does not perform any operations or data handling that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems to be standard parameter declarations for a larger IR-related processing module.",
