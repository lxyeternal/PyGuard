{
  "purpose": "Define function parameters for infrared detector properties, likely part of a larger class or module.",
  "sources": "No explicit data input sources; just class parameters used as arguments",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations observed",
  "flows": "No data flow, input, or output processing within this fragment",
  "anomalies": "Code snippet is incomplete; only argument list without implementation, no suspicious or unusual code behavior present",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a partial argument list for a function or class constructor, listing parameters NIRDA, VISDA, Optics, and Orbit, all of type IRDetector. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and no suspicious or malicious code behavior evident. The fragment appears to be part of a larger, benign code structure intended for setting properties related to infrared detection systems.",
  "conclusion": "The code fragment is a standard parameter list with no indication of malicious activity or security risks. It is part of a typical class or function definition with no suspicious elements.",
