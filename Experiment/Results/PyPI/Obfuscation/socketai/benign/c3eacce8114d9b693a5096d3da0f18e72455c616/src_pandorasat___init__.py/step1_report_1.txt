  "flows": "Check if config file exists -> load or create default -> save configuration back to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code describes standard configuration file handling using configparser. It reads from and writes to disk, creating defaults if the file does not exist. No untrusted data sources, no malicious code behavior, and no external network interactions are present. The description suggests straightforward configuration management without signs of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs typical configuration file handling with no indications of malicious or suspicious behavior. It appears to be safe and non-malicious.",
