{
  "purpose": "This code appears to define functions related to a detector's quantum efficiency and sensitivity, likely for scientific instrumentation or data analysis.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE', which is an ndarray representing wavelength in microns.",
  "sinks": "The functions return arrays of quantum efficiency and sensitivity, but no untrusted data is processed or output to external systems.",
  "flows": "Input 'vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE' is used to calculate 'qe' and 'sensitivity', but there are no external or untrusted data flows or outputs beyond function return values.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs. No obfuscated code, unusual language features, or misleading variable names. The variable names are complex and non-descriptive but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only descriptive comments and function headers for calculating quantum efficiency and sensitivity based on a wavelength array. There is no implementation provided; only function signatures and docstrings. The variable names are unusual and not meaningful but do not suggest malicious activity. The code does not process external data sources, write to files, or communicate over networks. There are no suspicious functions or hidden behaviors. Overall, the code appears to be standard scientific computation setup with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely functional, intended for scientific calculations related to a detector, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The complexity of variable names alone does not imply malicious intent, and the code appears safe.",
