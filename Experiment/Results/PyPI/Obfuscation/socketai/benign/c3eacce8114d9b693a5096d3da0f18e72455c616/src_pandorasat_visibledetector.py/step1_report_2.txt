{
  "purpose": "Document the purpose of the code as defining functions or methods related to the Pandora Visible Detector's quantum efficiency and sensitivity calculations.",
  "sources": "The code reads input parameters, specifically an array of wavelengths in microns, likely passed to functions as arguments.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks where untrusted data is used in a way that could cause security issues, such as network transmission, file writing, or command execution.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters (wavelength array) into the functions that calculate quantum efficiency and sensitivity, with no indication of further data handling or output manipulation that could introduce security risks.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are evident. The code appears to be straightforward documentation for scientific calculations without obfuscated or malicious elements.",
  "analysis": "The code provides docstrings for two functions related to the Pandora Visible Detector, describing input parameters and output values. It includes no executable code, no data handling beyond parameter description, and no security-sensitive operations. The parameters involve arrays of wavelengths with units specified, and the functions return efficiency and sensitivity arrays. There are no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be standard scientific documentation for functions calculating detector properties. No malicious or security-threatening behavior is evident based on the provided snippet.",
