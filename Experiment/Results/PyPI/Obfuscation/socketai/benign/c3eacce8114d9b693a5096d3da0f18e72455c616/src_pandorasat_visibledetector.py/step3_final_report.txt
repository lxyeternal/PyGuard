  "purpose": "Documentation for functions calculating quantum efficiency and sensitivity of the Pandora Visible Detector based on wavelength input.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, specifically the ndarray 'vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE' representing wavelength data.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external communication; purely descriptive docstrings.",
  "flows": "No executable code; only documentation describing input-output relationships.",
  "anomalies": "Typo 'Calulate' instead of 'Calculate'; highly non-descriptive variable name 'vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE'.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of docstrings with no executable logic, data processing, or external interactions. The variable name is complex and non-descriptive, which could suggest obfuscation or poor coding practice but not malicious intent. No signs of malware, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are present. The typo is a minor documentation error. The reports' high confidence scores and zero malware/security risk scores align with the benign nature. The variable naming is poor but not malicious; the code appears to be scientific documentation or stub functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, purely descriptive, with no malware or security risks. The only issues are a typo and poor variable naming, which do not impact security. The malware score remains 0, obfuscated score is around 0.1 due to naming, and security risk is 0.",
