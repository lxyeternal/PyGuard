{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions for calculating the quantum efficiency and sensitivity of the Pandora Visible Detector based on wavelength inputs.",
  "sources": "Input parameter `vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE`, which is an array of wavelengths in microns.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that handle untrusted data or perform sensitive operations like network communication, file writing, or executing commands.",
  "flows": "Input array (source) is used within calculations to produce output arrays for quantum efficiency and sensitivity.",
  "anomalies": "The code includes unusual variable names (e.g., `vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE`) that are non-descriptive, which can be a sign of obfuscation or poor coding practices. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations are visible. There is a misspelling in the word 'Calculate' as 'Calulate', indicating poor documentation rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet provides documentation for two functions: one for calculating quantum efficiency and another for sensitivity. The parameter naming is obscure but consistent with array inputs. There are no network operations, data leaks, or code injection points. The variable names do not suggest malicious behavior, and no suspicious operations are evident. The code's structure and comments imply scientific computations rather than malicious activity. The unusual naming could be accidental or due to obfuscation but does not inherently indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be standard scientific code related to detector characterization. It does not contain any evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. The unusual variable names are likely poor coding style rather than an attack vector.",
