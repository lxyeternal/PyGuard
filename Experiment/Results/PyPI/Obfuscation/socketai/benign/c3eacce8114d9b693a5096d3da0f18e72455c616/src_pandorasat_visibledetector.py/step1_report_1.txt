{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be documentation or a docstring describing functions related to a Pandora Visible Detector, specifically calculating quantum efficiency and sensitivity based on wavelength inputs.",
  "sources": "Input parameter vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE, which is an ndarray representing wavelengths in microns.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present; the functions return arrays of detector properties. No untrusted data processing or external communication is evident.",
  "flows": "Input wavelength array -> calculations within functions -> output arrays of quantum efficiency and sensitivity.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains a typo: 'Calulate' instead of 'Calculate', but no malicious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are evident. The code is purely descriptive, likely part of a docstring.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a docstring describing two functions: one for calculating quantum efficiency and another for sensitivity of a detector, both accepting an ndarray of wavelengths. There are no actual executable code snippets, no data processing, no external calls, or any suspicious operations. The only notable issue is a spelling mistake in the second function description. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "This is documentation describing detector parameter calculations. There are no signs of malware, malicious code, or security vulnerabilities. The code is benign and purely descriptive.",
