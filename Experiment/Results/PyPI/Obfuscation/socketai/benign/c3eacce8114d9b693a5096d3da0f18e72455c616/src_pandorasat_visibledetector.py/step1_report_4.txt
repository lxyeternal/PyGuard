  "purpose": "Provides functions for calculating the quantum efficiency and sensitivity of the Pandora Visible Detector based on wavelength input.",
  "sources": "Input parameter vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE, which is an ndarray of wavelengths in microns.",
  "sinks": "The functions return ndarrays of quantum efficiency and sensitivity, which are outputs based on the input data.",
  "flows": "Input wavelength array -> Calculation functions -> Output arrays of quantum efficiency and sensitivity.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors detected. No obfuscated code or unusual dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard scientific computation setup with functions designed to calculate physical parameters based on wavelength inputs. There are no indications of malicious activities such as network calls, data exfiltration, or system modifications. The parameters and returns are consistent with scientific measurements, and no security risks or anomalies are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign scientific calculation module with no malicious intent. It simply provides functions to compute detector properties based on wavelength input, with no suspicious or malicious code present.",
