  "conclusion": "The dependency appears generally safe, with most reports indicating no malicious intent. The only notable concern is report 3, where dynamic code execution raises suspicion but lacks definitive malicious activity. Adjusting the malware score in report 3 to 0.3, obfuscated to 0.4, and risk to 0.3 would better reflect the cautious suspicion. Other reports' scores are appropriate and justified."
