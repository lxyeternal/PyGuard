{
  "purpose": "The code provides parameter definitions and documentation for reading a distortion CSV file used in astronomical image correction, and for generating pixel coordinate arrays in both distorted and undistorted frames.",
  "sources": "Reading the 'distortion_file' CSV file, input parameters such as target RA/Dec, theta, and the detector object.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the CSV file contents if maliciously crafted, but no data is transmitted or exfiltrated by the code itself.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and the CSV file are used to generate pixel coordinate arrays; no external data flows or network activity are present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, obfuscation, or hardcoded secrets; the code is standard for scientific distortion correction routines.",
  "analysis": "The code consists mainly of parameter documentation and descriptions for reading a CSV distortion grid and computing pixel positions. There is no executable logic, network activity, or suspicious behavior. The references and parameter descriptions align with standard astrophysical procedures. The potential risk arises from reading external files, but this is typical in scientific workflows and does not constitute malicious activity. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the security risk is minimal (around 0.1), reflecting standard file handling. No anomalies or obfuscation are detected. Overall, the code appears benign and consistent with supply chain security best practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard documentation and parameter handling for distortion correction in astronomical imaging, with no malicious intent or security vulnerabilities evident. The assigned scores are appropriate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). It poses no significant supply chain security threat.",
