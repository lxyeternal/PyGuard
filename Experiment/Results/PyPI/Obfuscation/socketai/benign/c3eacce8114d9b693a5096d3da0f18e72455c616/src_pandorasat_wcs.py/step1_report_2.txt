{
  "purpose": "This code appears to handle astronomical image distortion correction by reading a distortion CSV file and computing pixel positions in distorted and undistorted frames.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'distortion_file', 'target_ra', 'target_dec', and 'theta'. Reading the CSV file specified by 'distortion_file'.",
  "sinks": "None identified explicitly in the provided code snippet; no network, file write, or sensitive data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Reads 'distortion_file' -> processes CSV data to produce pixel arrays X, Y, Xp, Yp.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or unusual behavior detected. The code's focus on processing astronomical distortion data is standard; no obfuscation or hidden logic evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is primarily documentation and parameter definitions with no executable logic. It describes reading a CSV distortion file and computing pixel positions for astronomical imaging. All parameters and return descriptions are related to image distortion correction. No network activity, credential handling, or suspicious operations are present. The code appears to be a straightforward implementation of a known astrophotography correction method, referencing standard documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation related to astronomical image processing without malicious intent. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks in the provided snippet.",
