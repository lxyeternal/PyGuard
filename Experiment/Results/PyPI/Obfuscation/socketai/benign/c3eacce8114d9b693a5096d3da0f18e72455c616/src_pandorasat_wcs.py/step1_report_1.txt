{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be related to astronomical image processing, specifically building a World Coordinate System (WCS) using detector data, target coordinates, and optional distortion corrections.",
  "sources": "Reads parameters such as detector object, target RA/Dec, theta, and a distortion CSV file path. Also reads from the CSV file for distortion data.",
  "sinks": "Returns numpy arrays of pixel positions; no apparent data sinks or external data transmissions are present.",
  "flows": "Inputs (detector, target RA/Dec, theta, distortion file) are used to process and generate pixel coordinate arrays; no data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns observed. The code is mostly documentation and parameter definitions with CSV reading instructions.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly consists of parameter descriptions and a function outline for reading distortion data from a CSV file, which is standard in astronomical image calibration. No executable logic, network calls, or suspicious constructs are present. The documentation aligns with normal practices for distortion correction in FITS images, referencing official SIP distortion standards. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be standard documentation and parameter handling for an astronomical calibration routine. No malicious intent, suspicious behavior, or security risks are detected.",
