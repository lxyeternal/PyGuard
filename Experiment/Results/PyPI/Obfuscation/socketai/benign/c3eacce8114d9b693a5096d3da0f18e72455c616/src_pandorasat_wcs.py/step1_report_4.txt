{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions for reading distortion files and computing coordinate transformations related to astronomical image processing, specifically for correcting pixel distortions using SIP polynomial models.",
  "sources": "Input parameters include 'distortion_file' (file path), and potentially external modules or data sources for detector and coordinate information.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include reading the distortion CSV file from disk, which could be manipulated or malicious if the file contents are controlled by an attacker.",
  "flows": "From 'distortion_file' input (source), the code reads and processes the CSV data (sink) to generate pixel coordinate arrays. The flow is straightforward file reading and data processing.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code structures detected; standard parameter documentation and CSV reading logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or obfuscated code observed. The code is consistent with typical image distortion correction functions.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to define parameter descriptions and return values for functions related to distortion correction. It emphasizes correct handling of CSV files containing distortion grid data. There are no signs of malicious code, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of external libraries like 'astropy' and 'numpy' is normal for scientific computing. No anomalies like hardcoded secrets or unusual behaviors are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code fragment appears to be a standard implementation for handling distortion correction in astronomical images. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks. It is safe from a supply chain security perspective.",
