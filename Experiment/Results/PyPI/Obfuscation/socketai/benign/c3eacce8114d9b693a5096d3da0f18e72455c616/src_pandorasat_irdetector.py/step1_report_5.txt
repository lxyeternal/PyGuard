  "purpose": "The code provides functions to calculate the quantum efficiency and sensitivity of the Pandora IR detector based on wavelength input.",
  "sources": "Input parameter vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE, which is an ndarray representing wavelength in microns",
  "sinks": "Returns arrays for quantum efficiency (qe) and sensitivity, potentially used downstream for analysis or display",
  "flows": "Input ndarray -> Calculation functions -> Output ndarray for qe and sensitivity",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code behaviors observed. Function definitions are straightforward and document their purpose clearly. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of function docstrings describing parameter types, return types, and the purpose of the functions. There are no executable statements, data processing, or external calls shown. The absence of actual implementation code minimizes risk. The parameter name appears obfuscated but is consistently used in documentation; no malicious behavior can be inferred from this alone. Since only docstrings are present, there are no evident security risks or malicious activities. It appears to be a well-documented interface or placeholder for actual calculation functions.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided documentation, the code appears to be a benign interface for detector calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks within these docstrings. The code's purpose is clear and does not involve any suspicious activities.",
