  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions for calculating the quantum efficiency and sensitivity of a Pandora IR detector based on wavelength input.",
  "sources": "Input parameter 'vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE', which is an ndarray of wavelength values in microns.",
  "sinks": "The functions likely return numpy arrays of computed quantum efficiency and sensitivity, but no direct sinks for untrusted data are evident in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "Input 'vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE' is used to compute 'qe' and 'sensitivity' through mathematical operations within functions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains repeated spelling errors in 'Calculate' (misspelled as 'Calulate') which may indicate hastily written or unpolished code, but no suspicious or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is primarily documentation for two functions, with no actual implementation provided. It defines input parameters and return types for functions that calculate detector properties. There are no code snippets executing external commands, reading sensitive data, or performing suspicious operations. The misspelling of 'Calculate' does not imply malicious intent. Overall, the code appears to be standard scientific calculation documentation without malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is simple documentation for scientific calculations with no signs of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malicious code. The only notable issue is a spelling mistake, which does not impact security.",
