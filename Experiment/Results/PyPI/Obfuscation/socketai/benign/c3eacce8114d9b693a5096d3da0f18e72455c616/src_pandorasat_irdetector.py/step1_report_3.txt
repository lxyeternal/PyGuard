{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions for calculating the quantum efficiency and sensitivity of the Pandora IR detector based on wavelength input.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters, specifically an ndarray representing wavelength values in microns.",
  "sinks": "There are no evident sinks such as network connections, file writes, or data exfiltration points in the provided fragment.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the input parameter (wavelength array) into calculation functions that output arrays of quantum efficiency and sensitivity.",
  "anomalies": "The code snippet lacks implementation details; it only contains docstrings and parameter descriptions. There are no hardcoded credentials, unusual code constructs, or obfuscated segments. The inconsistent spelling of 'Calculate' (misspelled as 'Calulate') is noted but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is purely descriptive, consisting of docstrings outlining function purposes, parameters, and return values. There is no actual logic, code execution, or suspicious behavior present. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious data handling are evident. The absence of executable code limits the ability to analyze potential security risks fully. The focus is solely on defining detector characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment contains only documentation for functions related to detector parameters without any executable or malicious code. It does not pose security risks or malware concerns based on the provided content.",
