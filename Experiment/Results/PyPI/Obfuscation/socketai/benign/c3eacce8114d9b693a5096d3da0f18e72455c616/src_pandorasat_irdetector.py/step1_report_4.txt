{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define functions related to a Pandora IR detector, specifically calculating quantum efficiency and sensitivity based on wavelength input.",
  "sources": "Input parameter vXFYUCmMmKCSSbMqwBLCJLieZAZcTzPE, which is an NDArray representing wavelength in microns.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks found; the code returns arrays for quantum efficiency and sensitivity, likely for further processing or analysis.",
  "flows": "Input wavelength data flows into functions that calculate quantum efficiency and sensitivity, then outputs arrays without data leakage or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "There are typographical errors in the comments (e.g., 'Calulate' instead of 'Calculate'), but no unusual code behaviors, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious logic are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is mostly descriptive comments and function signatures indicating calculations related to a detector's properties. No actual implementation details are provided, and there are no signs of data manipulation, code injection, or malicious logic. The parameters and returns are standard for scientific computation involving NDArray data. No external data sources, network communications, or hidden behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a straightforward, scientific description of functions for a detector's quantum efficiency and sensitivity calculations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activity. It seems to be a legitimate, non-malicious module focused on scientific calculations.",
