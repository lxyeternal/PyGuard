The only notable concern is report 3, where dynamic code execution raises suspicion but lacks definitive malicious activity. Adjusting the malware score in report 3 to 0.3, obfuscated to 0.4, and risk to 0.3 would better reflect the cautious suspicion. Other reports' scores are appropriate and justified."

The assigned scores are appropriate, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score of 0, and a very low security risk score (~0.1). It poses no significant supply chain security threat."

The obfuscation warrants caution, and further sanitization and analysis are recommended before deployment. The malware score is low, but the obfuscation score is moderate to high, and the security risk is moderate due to potential injection points."
