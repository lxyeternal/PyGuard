{
  "purpose": "Module export definitions with obfuscated import identifiers, likely for internal or autogenerated use.",
  "sources": "Imports from relative modules: .aio_pika_instrumentor and .version",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks present; no data leaks or external effects observed",
  "flows": "Import statements as source; no data flow or execution flow leading to external effects",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated, nonsensical class/variable names; minimal code structure; no active logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports two elements with nonsensical, obfuscated names from internal modules, then defines __all__ with string identifiers not directly present in the snippet. No network activity, data handling, or malicious code is evident. The obfuscated identifiers suggest possible concealment or autogenerated code, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0.2, obfuscation: 0.7-0.8, security risk: 0.2-0.3) are consistent with the evidence. The code appears benign but warrants further review of the imported modules to rule out hidden malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, syntactically correct module with obfuscated import names. No active malicious behavior is detected, but obfuscation raises suspicion. The current scores are appropriate; further inspection of the imported modules is recommended to ensure no malicious code is concealed. Overall, the snippet appears benign but should be monitored for obfuscation patterns.",
