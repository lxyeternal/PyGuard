{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform standard data processing tasks, likely related to data collection or transformation, with no clear malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Potential data input points include environment variables, user inputs, or file reads (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential data output points include network transmissions, file writes, or logs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs) through processing functions to sinks (outputs or external communication).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network connections, or obfuscated code detected. The code structure is straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code shows typical Python constructs with standard library usage. There are no indications of malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or code injection. The absence of obfuscation, suspicious network activity, or secret keys suggests low likelihood of malicious intent. The code's purpose and data flow do not reveal any anomalies or malicious patterns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears safe and free from malware or malicious supply chain components.",
