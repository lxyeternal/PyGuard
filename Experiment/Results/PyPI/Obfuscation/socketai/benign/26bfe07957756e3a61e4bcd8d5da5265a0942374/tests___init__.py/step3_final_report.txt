  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, config files, command-line arguments, dynamic imports, eval/exec statements, hardcoded suspicious strings, network-related code.",
  "sinks": "Logging outputs, subprocess/system commands, environment variables, dynamic code execution points, network connections.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables and dynamic imports flow into eval/exec or network functions, potentially leading to malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, dynamic module imports, hardcoded suspicious strings (domains/IPs), obfuscation indicators, reading environment variables for sensitive data.",
  "analysis": "The code in the majority of reports appears benign, with straightforward logic, no suspicious network activity, and no obfuscation. Reports 1-4 show typical application patterns with no malicious indicators, justified by malware scores of 0 and low security risks. Report 5 exhibits red flags: dynamic code execution, suspicious strings, environment variable usage, and obfuscation, warranting high malware (0.75), obfuscation (0.7), and security risk (0.8) scores. The reasoning aligns with common malicious indicators, and the scores are justified by the described behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "Most code is benign with appropriate low scores. Report 5 contains suspicious patterns indicative of malicious intent, justified by high scores. Overall, the scoring is consistent with the analysis; no adjustments are necessary.",
