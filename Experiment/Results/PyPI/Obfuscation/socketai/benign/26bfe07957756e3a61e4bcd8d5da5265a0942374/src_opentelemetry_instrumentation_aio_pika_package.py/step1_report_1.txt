  "purpose": "Define a collection of instrument package specifications for dependency management.",
  "sources": "Assignment of a tuple containing a string to the variable '_instruments'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or sensitive data leaks detected.",
  "flows": "None, as the code is simple assignment.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code appears to be a straightforward declaration of dependencies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Collection' from 'typing' and assigns a tuple with a dependency string to '_instruments'. There are no input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, and no hardcoded credentials or secrets. The dependency string specifies a range of acceptable versions for 'aio_pika', a messaging library, which is standard for dependency management. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a benign dependency declaration without malicious intent or security risks.",
