  "purpose": "Define a collection of instrument package dependencies with version constraints.",
  "sources": "The variable '_instruments' is assigned a tuple of dependency strings.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only assigns static strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses a leading underscore in '_instruments', indicating internal use, but no suspicious behavior is observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Collection' from 'typing' for type hinting, then assigns a tuple containing a dependency string with version constraints to '_instruments'. The dependency string appears standard for specifying package requirements. There are no signs of hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or obfuscated patterns. The code is minimal, straightforward, and does not perform any operations beyond static assignment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is a simple declaration of package dependencies using standard Python syntax. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation.",
