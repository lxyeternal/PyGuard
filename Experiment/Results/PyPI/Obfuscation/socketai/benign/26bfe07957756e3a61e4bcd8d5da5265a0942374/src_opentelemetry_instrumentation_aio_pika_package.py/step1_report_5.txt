  "purpose": "Define a collection of instrument package dependencies with version constraints.",
  "sources": "The assignment of the tuple to the variable _instruments.",
  "targets": "No untrusted data source or external input involved.",
  "flows": "N/A, no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Use of tuple syntax with parentheses but assigning to a variable with a colon, which is a syntax error in Python; the code appears incomplete or malformed.",
  "analysis": "The code attempts to assign a tuple containing a string with package name and version constraints to a variable. The syntax used is incorrect; parentheses are used as if defining a tuple but with no trailing comma, which results in a string, not a tuple. There is no input/output, no dynamic code execution, and no malicious behavior. The code appears to be a fragment with a syntax error rather than malicious code. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is a syntactically incorrect fragment intended to define a package dependency list. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. It is likely incomplete or malformed, but based on current analysis, it is benign.",
