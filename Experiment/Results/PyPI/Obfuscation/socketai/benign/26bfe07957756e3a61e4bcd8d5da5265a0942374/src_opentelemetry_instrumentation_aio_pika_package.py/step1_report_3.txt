  "purpose": "Declare a collection of package dependencies with specified version constraints.",
  "sources": "The variable '_instruments' assigned a tuple containing a dependency string.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or perform I/O with external sources are present.",
  "flows": "The code simply assigns a tuple to a variable; no data flow involving external inputs occurs.",
  "anomalies": "The dependency string appears standard for specifying package versions; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an immutable collection of dependencies as a tuple with one string. No input/output operations, no dynamic code execution, no obfuscated or unusual constructs. It is a typical dependency declaration fragment. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malicious intent within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a straightforward declaration of a package dependency with version constraints. It poses no security risks, contains no malware indicators, and does not exhibit obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
