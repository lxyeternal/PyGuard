{
  "purpose": "Simple dependency declaration specifying version constraints for 'aio_pika'.",
  "sources": "The string 'aio_pika >= 7.2.0, < 10.0.0' within the tuple assigned to _instruments.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static assignment only.",
  "flows": "N/A - static data assignment with no data flow from external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Parentheses used without a trailing comma, leading to a string instead of a tuple; syntax issue present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward dependency list with a syntax flaw in the form of missing comma, which causes the parentheses to not create a tuple but a string. No malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior is present. The syntax error could lead to runtime issues but does not indicate malicious intent. The dependency string itself is standard and safe. The syntax flaw is minor and does not impact security but should be corrected for proper functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign and intended for dependency specification. The only concern is a syntax error that results in malformed code, which should be fixed. No malware or obfuscation detected. The security risk is minimal, primarily related to code correctness rather than security threat.",
