{
  "purpose": "Define a collection of package dependency specifications as a module-level variable",
  "sources": "Assignment of the tuple containing dependency string to the variable _instruments",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data output",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code uses standard type annotations and simple tuple assignment",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Collection' from 'typing' and assigns a tuple with a dependency string to '_instruments'. The dependency string specifies version constraints for the 'aio_pika' package. The code does not perform any data processing, network operations, or dynamic code execution. There are no signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior. The code appears to be a simple configuration or dependency list declaration.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward declaration of a package dependency list with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. It likely serves as a configuration reference within a larger project.",
