{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version or build identifier to a variable with an obfuscated name, likely for placeholder or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input, data reading, or data flow; only a variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no untrusted data processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Single source (variable assignment) with no data flow to other parts of code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; the string resembles a version identifier rather than malicious payload.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward variable assignment with an obfuscated name and a string value that appears to be a version or build identifier. No external inputs, outputs, or functions are present. The obfuscation is likely intentional or placeholder, not malicious. No signs of malicious activity, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified due to the variable name, but it does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is minimal, and malware likelihood is zero. The code's simplicity and lack of external interaction suggest benign behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscation likely used for placeholder or obfuscation purposes. No malicious activity or security risks are detected. The assigned scores are consistent with the analysis, and no further action is necessary.",
