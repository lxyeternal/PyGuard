{
  "purpose": "Configuration setup for RabbitMQ connection using obfuscated variable names and external parameters.",
  "sources": "External variables SERVER_USER, SERVER_PASS, SERVER_HOST, SERVER_PORT used in URL; import alias from aio_pika; input data not directly read in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential reliance on external variables for credentials and connection parameters; no direct data sinks or malicious data flows observed.",
  "flows": "External variables (SERVER_USER, SERVER_PASS, etc.) feed into URL construction; no active data flow or malicious payload execution demonstrated.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import alias 'sCABLMUfNsntopSsrPvxzyhXxdRXUWXk'; nonsensical variable names; reliance on undefined external variables; no direct malicious activity but suspicious obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily sets up configuration for RabbitMQ connection with heavily obfuscated naming and import alias. No active malicious actions are evident, but the import alias and variable names suggest concealment. The URL depends on external variables not defined here, which could be manipulated externally. The version parsing appears benign. Overall, the code is a configuration snippet with suspicious obfuscation but no direct malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and reliance on external, undefined variables, which could be exploited in a broader context. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present within this fragment. The obfuscation warrants caution, but the actual behavior appears benign. The overall security risk is moderate, and further review of the broader codebase and runtime context is recommended.",
