{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be setting up connection parameters and configuration objects for RabbitMQ messaging using the aio_pika library and URL construction.",
  "sources": "The only input source is the 'aiopika_version' string, which is split into a tuple. No other input or data reading mechanisms are present.",
  "sinks": "The main sink is the URL object 'QrBrCxORFcreCXPMMVRQGKgJDEjuYCvY' which constructs an AMQP URL using variables, but these variables ('SERVER_USER', 'SERVER_PASS', etc.) are not assigned or used elsewhere in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There is no flow of untrusted data from input sources to sensitive sinks; variables are assigned static strings and imported module attributes, with no data transformations or network transmissions shown.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated import alias 'sCABLMUfNsntopSsrPvxzyhXxdRXUWXk' for 'aio_pika', and variable names appear nonsensical or randomly generated, indicating possible obfuscation. Many variables are assigned static strings or empty dictionaries, with no functional code logic.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of importing modules, defining variables with static or placeholder values, and constructing a URL object for AMQP connection. The import alias for 'aio_pika' is unusual and obfuscated, but no malicious behavior such as network transmission, data exfiltration, or command execution is evident. No user input or external data sources are processed, and no sensitive operations are performed. The code structure suggests configuration setup rather than active logic. The presence of obfuscated names and unused variables indicates potential obfuscation, but not necessarily malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a configuration or setup snippet for RabbitMQ messaging, with obfuscated naming and no active malicious behavior detected. No data leaks, network connections to suspicious domains, or harmful actions are evident. The obfuscation may be an attempt to conceal intent but does not necessarily indicate malicious activity.",
