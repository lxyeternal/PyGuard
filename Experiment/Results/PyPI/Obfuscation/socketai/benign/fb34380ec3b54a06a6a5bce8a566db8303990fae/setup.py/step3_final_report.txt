{
  "purpose": "The code is a setup script for packaging a Python module named 'ruxfuntn0gf8m3tt', using obfuscated variable names but static strings, with no dynamic or malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments to obfuscated variables, including package name, version, download URL, keywords, and classifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, user input, or external data flows are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code only assigns static strings and calls setup().",
  "anomalies": "Superficial obfuscation of variable names; no malicious code, dynamic execution, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The script is a standard setup.py with obfuscated variable names containing static package metadata. The download URL is constructed via string concatenation but points to a legitimate GitHub resource. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or untrusted input is present. The obfuscation appears superficial and intended for concealment but does not impact security. All reports correctly identify the static nature and superficial obfuscation, assigning low malware and security risk scores. No evidence suggests malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard package setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no malware or malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the package appears safe for use.",
