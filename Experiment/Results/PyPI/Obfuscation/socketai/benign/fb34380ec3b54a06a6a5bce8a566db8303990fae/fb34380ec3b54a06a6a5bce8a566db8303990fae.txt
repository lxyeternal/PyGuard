      "conclusion": "The code is a benign implementation of varint encoding/decoding routines with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, external communication, or security vulnerabilities. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent based on current analysis. The supply chain risk is low, primarily due to obfuscation, which warrants cautious monitoring but does not justify blocking or removal."
