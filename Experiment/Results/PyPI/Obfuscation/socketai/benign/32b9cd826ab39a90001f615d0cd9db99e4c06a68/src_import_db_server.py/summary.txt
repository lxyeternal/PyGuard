  "conclusion": "The code is insecure, obfuscated, and capable of remote command execution, posing high security risks if exploited. While no explicit malware payloads are present, its design allows for malicious misuse. The high obfuscation and lack of validation justify elevated risk and malware scores. It should be treated as high risk, requiring thorough review, validation, and proper security controls before deployment."
