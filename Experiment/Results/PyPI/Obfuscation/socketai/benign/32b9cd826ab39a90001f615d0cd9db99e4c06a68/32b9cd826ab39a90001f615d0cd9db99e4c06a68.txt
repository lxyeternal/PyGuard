      "confidence": 1,
      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with an unnecessary import. There is no malicious activity or security vulnerability. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is justified by the unused import, which is harmless but slightly suspicious as placeholder or incomplete code."

      "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analyses, and overall security risk is minimal. Slight caution is warranted for dynamic execution concerns, but no actual malicious activity is detected. The assessments are justified and aligned with the provided summaries."

      "obfuscated": 0.75,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is insecure, obfuscated, and capable of remote command execution, posing high security risks if exploited. While no explicit malware payloads are present, its design allows for malicious misuse. The high obfuscation and lack of validation justify elevated risk and malware scores. It should be treated as high risk, requiring thorough review, validation, and proper security controls before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and handles credentials insecurely, raising suspicion but lacking concrete evidence of malicious activity. Scores are appropriately cautious, emphasizing the need for further analysis of the called function to determine potential malicious behavior."
