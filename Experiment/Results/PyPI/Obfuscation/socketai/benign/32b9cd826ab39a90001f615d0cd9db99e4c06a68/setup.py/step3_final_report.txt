{
  "purpose": "A minimal setup script for package configuration, primarily setting version information.",
  "sources": "Import of 'environ' from 'os' (unused), and the 'setup' function call.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; the code does not process input or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the import is unused and the setup call is static.",
  "anomalies": "Unused import of 'environ' which is not utilized in the code; no other anomalies.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'environ' but does not use it, indicating either placeholder code or incomplete implementation. The 'setup' function is called with a static version string, typical for package configuration scripts. There are no data processing, user input handling, or security-sensitive operations. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks are present. The import of 'environ' is benign but unnecessary, leading to a very low security concern. The code's simplicity and lack of obfuscation confirm its benign nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign setup script with an unnecessary import. There is no malicious activity or security vulnerability. The minimal security risk score of 0.1 is justified by the unused import, which is harmless but slightly suspicious as placeholder or incomplete code.",
