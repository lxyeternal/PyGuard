  "purpose": "Setup script for packaging a Python project, specifying version 1.0.0.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables (via 'environ' from 'os'), used as a standard method to access environment data.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "Environment variables could potentially influence setup if used, but not in this code as written.",
  "anomalies": "The 'environ' import is unused, indicating potential unnecessary code or preparation for future use. No malicious or suspicious code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'environ' from 'os' but does not utilize it; it only runs a basic setup with a fixed version number. There are no code injections, data leaks, or malicious behavior. The presence of an unused import is benign but might suggest incomplete implementation or placeholder for future environment-based configuration.",
  "conclusion": "This is a minimal setup script with an unused import. It does not contain malicious behavior, malware, or security risks based on the current content.",
