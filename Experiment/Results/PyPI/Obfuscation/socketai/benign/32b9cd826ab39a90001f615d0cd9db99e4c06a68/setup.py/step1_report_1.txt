{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, primarily used to define package metadata and install configurations.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables via 'os.environ' (though not used explicitly in the code), imports 'setup' from 'setuptools'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks present; the code does not process user input or untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply calls setup() with a static version string.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The import of environ is unused but harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'environ' from the 'os' module but does not utilize it, indicating potential preparation for environment-based configuration, yet currently unused. The setup() function is called with a static version string, typical for package setup scripts. There is no malicious logic, no data processing, and no suspicious operations. The presence of the unused 'environ' import might be a placeholder but does not impact security.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script with no malicious behavior or security issues. The code is minimal, standard, and safe.",
