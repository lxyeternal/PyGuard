  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, specifying version information.",
  "sources": "Reading environment variables via 'environ' (though not used here), and calling 'setup()' from setuptools.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function could potentially be a sink if it processes untrusted data, but here it only sets a static version.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; environment variables are imported but not utilized.",
  "anomalies": "Import of 'environ' from 'os' without subsequent use; no dynamic code execution, no hardcoded secrets or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports environment variables but does not use them. The setup() call is static, only setting a version. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, or data leaks. The code appears to be a minimal, benign package setup script.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward setup script with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The import of 'environ' is unnecessary but not harmful. Overall, it is benign.",
