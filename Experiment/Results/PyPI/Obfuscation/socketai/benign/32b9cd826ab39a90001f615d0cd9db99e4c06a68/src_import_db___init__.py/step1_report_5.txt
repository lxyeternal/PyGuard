  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a standard Python script performing some data processing or utility functions. There is no explicit indication of malicious intent based on the visible content.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from standard input, environment variables, and possibly external files or network resources (if present). Specific input sources are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output to standard output, files, or network connections. There is no evidence of dangerous operations such as executing untrusted code or writing sensitive data to suspicious locations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as user input or environment variables through processing functions to sinks like output or storage. No explicit flow patterns indicating malicious behavior are observed.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are evident. No backdoors, code injection, or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code shows typical Python programming patterns with standard library usage. No malicious or sabotage code, such as network exfiltration, system compromise, or cryptomining activities, is present. The code structure and formatting are normal, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious tricks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a benign utility script with no suspicious or malicious intent.",
