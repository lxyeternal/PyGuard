  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules, filesystem/network interactions, external data inputs.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communications, external file access, dynamic code execution points (eval/exec).",
  "flows": "Sources to sinks via data processing, environment variable reads, potential eval/exec calls.",
  "anomalies": "Potential use of eval/exec without sanitization, external data handling, no explicit malicious payloads but possible risky constructs.",
  "analysis": "All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns based on their summaries. The malware scores are consistently 0, aligning with the lack of evidence. The security risk scores are low (0.1-0.3), with Report 4's slightly higher risk justified by mention of potential dynamic execution concerns. Confidence levels vary appropriately with the amount of information; high where code is straightforward, lower where details are limited. No logical flaws or inconsistencies are observed. The cautious approach in Report 4 regarding eval/exec is justified, but without concrete evidence, the risk score could be lowered further.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious code or obfuscation. The scores are consistent with the analyses, and overall security risk is minimal. Slight caution is warranted for dynamic execution concerns, but no actual malicious activity is detected. The assessments are justified and aligned with the provided summaries.",
