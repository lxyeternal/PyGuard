{
  "purpose": "The code imports various modules and classes from the openfisca_tools package, likely for simulation, modeling, and testing purposes.",
  "sources": "Import statements from openfisca_tools modules, reading static module/class definitions.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, external communication, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static imports, so no source-to-sink data flow exists.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical class and function names, which are suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, indicating static dependencies without active code execution. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious behavior. No evidence of malicious intent, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities is present. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain low due to the absence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of static import statements with obfuscated names. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The overall security risk is minimal, and the malware score should be 0.",
