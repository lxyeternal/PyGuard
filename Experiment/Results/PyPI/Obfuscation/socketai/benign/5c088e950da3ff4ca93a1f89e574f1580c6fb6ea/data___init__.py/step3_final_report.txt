  "purpose": "Analyze import statements with obfuscated variable names from openfisca_tools modules for potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Import statements from openfisca_tools.data.private, public, dataset, and cli modules.",
  "sinks": "None present in the code snippet; potential concern if these variables are used maliciously downstream.",
  "flows": "Import statements as sources; downstream usage could be sinks if variables are exploited or exfiltrated.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, import from private modules, absence of further code or context.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements with obfuscated names, which raises suspicion but does not demonstrate malicious activity. The import of private data modules warrants caution. Scores assigned in reports are generally consistent; malware scores are low or zero, reflecting no direct malicious behavior. Obfuscation is notable but not conclusive of malicious intent. The confidence levels are high, given the limited context. No active malicious actions are evident, but the obfuscation and private data access justify cautious monitoring.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation but suspicious due to obfuscated variable names and private module imports. Scores are appropriate; no evidence of malware or active security threats is present. Continued observation and further code review are recommended if more context becomes available.",
