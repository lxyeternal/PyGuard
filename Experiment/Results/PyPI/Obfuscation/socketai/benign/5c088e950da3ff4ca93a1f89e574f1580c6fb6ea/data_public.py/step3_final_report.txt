{
  "purpose": "The code defines a class for downloading datasets from URLs stored in a dictionary, streaming the content, verifying size, and saving to disk. It also includes a method to prevent automatic uploads, indicating manual handling.",
  "sources": "The URL retrieved from 'self.url_by_year' based on the input year; the HTTP response headers for content-length; the streaming content from the requests.get call.",
  "sinks": "Writing the downloaded content to a local file; raising an exception to prevent automated upload.",
  "flows": "The method retrieves the URL from 'url_by_year', performs an HTTP GET request, streams data into a file, and verifies the size matches the content-length header.",
  "anomalies": "Class and method names are obfuscated and non-descriptive, which could hinder readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network activity are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard dataset download operations with proper error handling and size verification. The obfuscation of class and method names is superficial and likely for obscurity, not maliciousness. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious network activity are evident. The explicit exception in the second method indicates deliberate design to prevent automated uploads. The logic is straightforward and aligns with legitimate data retrieval utilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign dataset downloader with obfuscated naming but no malicious behavior. It does not pose supply chain risks or malware threats. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and appropriate for its purpose.",
