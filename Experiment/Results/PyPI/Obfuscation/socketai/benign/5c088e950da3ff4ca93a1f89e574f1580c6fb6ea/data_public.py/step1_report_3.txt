{
  "purpose": "This code extends a dataset class to download files from URLs specified by year, saving them locally with progress tracking and size verification.",
  "sources": "The code reads URLs from the 'url_by_year' dictionary and the 'content-length' header from HTTP responses.",
  "sinks": "The code writes downloaded data to files using 'open' and writes network response content directly to files.",
  "flows": "URL from 'url_by_year' -> HTTP GET request -> streamed content -> file write",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no suspicious domain connections, and no obfuscated code. The download process uses standard libraries and progress bars. No apparent backdoors or hidden behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from an imported dataset class, with a method to download files based on a year key. It retrieves the URL, performs an HTTP GET request with streaming, and writes the content to disk while tracking progress. The method includes a size check to ensure file integrity. The other method explicitly raises an exception for uploads, indicating uploads are not supported. No use of untrusted data beyond standard request handling, and no suspicious activity or malicious code detected. The code appears straightforward, implementing a download with verification.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a standard file download operation with progress reporting and size verification, with no evidence of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It appears to be a legitimate data handling utility.",
