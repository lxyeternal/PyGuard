  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and cross-verify with the code.\n\n**Overall code assessment:**\n- The code defines a class inheriting from an external dataset class.\n- It has a method to download datasets from URLs stored in `url_by_year`.\n- The download method performs an HTTP GET request with streaming, progress bar, size verification, and writes to disk.\n- Another method raises an exception, indicating manual upload is not supported.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code (except for class/method names), or suspicious network activity are evident.\n- The logic appears standard for dataset download functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Report 1:\n- **Purpose & flow:** Accurate; describes downloading datasets from URLs, streaming, progress, size check.\n- **Anomalies:** None observed.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior, no secrets, standard data download.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues. \n\n---\n\n### Report 2:\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; similar to Report 1.\n- **Anomalies:** None; no secrets, no obfuscation.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; straightforward download with validation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate. No issues.\n\n---\n\n### Report 3:\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; similar description.\n- **Anomalies:** None; standard download process.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious behavior or suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 4:\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct.\n- **Anomalies:** None; standard download with size verification.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no malicious intent or suspicious network activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.2, Obfuscated 0, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Report 5:\n- **Purpose & flow:** Correct; notes obfuscated class/method names but clarifies they are likely for obscurity, not malicious intent.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated names, but no malicious behavior.\n- **Analysis & conclusion:** Correct; no signs of malicious activity, just obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, Risk 0.1, Obfuscated 0.8, Confidence 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable; obfuscation is present but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code correctness:** No issues; all reports agree the code is standard dataset download logic.\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Slightly higher in report 5 due to obfuscated class/method names, which is acceptable.\n- **Risk score:** Low, reflecting minimal security risk, primarily due to the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.8 — obfuscation exists but is not malicious.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 — low security risk, standard data download utility.\n\n**In conclusion:**\nThe reports are consistent and accurate. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious behavior. The risk score should remain low, reflecting the benign nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n**My final estimates:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.8\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and the detailed review.",
