{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a class that downloads datasets from URLs based on a year, saving them locally, and possibly handling data retrieval operations for a larger project.",
  "sources": "The code reads URL data from the 'url_by_year' dictionary, and makes HTTP GET requests using the 'requests' library. It reads headers and content from responses.",
  "sinks": "Data is written directly to files using the 'open' function. The URL strings are used directly in requests without sanitization.",
  "flows": "Data flows from URL lookup ('url_by_year'), through 'requests.get' (source), into the response content (stream), then written into local files (sink).",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unnecessary dynamic execution observed. The 'requests.get' call uses stream and checks content-length, which is standard. No suspicious network activity or data leaks are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a class inheriting from a dataset class, with methods to download datasets from URLs specified in a dictionary. The method 'ijSEndJTCdBicHppVWUDDbsHVYIhtBBD' performs an HTTP GET request, streams data, tracks progress with tqdm, and writes data to disk, verifying the total size. The method 'TNqGKZWvsqpqDKmOvIbBRyBfEUxgeuCt' raises an exception, indicating manual upload is required, not automation. There are no hardcoded secrets, suspicious URL handling, or network behaviors. The code appears standard for dataset download functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate dataset download utility with no evident malicious behavior or security risks. It handles data securely with proper error checking. No indicators of malware or malicious activities are present.",
