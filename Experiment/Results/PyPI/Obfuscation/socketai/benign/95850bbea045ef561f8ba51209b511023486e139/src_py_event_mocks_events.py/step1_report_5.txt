{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle event templates and merging data into template files based on event types, likely for event processing or configuration management.",
  "sources": "The code reads from JSON files located in the 'events' directory, specifically files named based on the event_type input.",
  "sinks": "The code loads JSON data from files; however, it does not write or send data externally. No direct sinks that could leak data or cause harm are present.",
  "flows": "The event_type input influences the filename path, which is read and then merged with optional body data. The data flows from input parameters through file loading and merging operations.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious obfuscation are detected. The code uses straightforward file handling and JSON merging. Variable names are obfuscated but do not suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports necessary modules, sets up logging, and defines functions for handling event templates. It constructs file paths based on event_type, replacing ':' with '/', and loads JSON templates. It then merges optional body data into these templates using a safe merging strategy. No user input is executed or injected into code logic beyond filename generation. No network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious commands are present. The code appears legitimate for configuration or event handling purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard utility for handling event templates, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names do not correlate with malicious intent, and there are no suspicious external interactions or sensitive data handling beyond reading JSON files.",
