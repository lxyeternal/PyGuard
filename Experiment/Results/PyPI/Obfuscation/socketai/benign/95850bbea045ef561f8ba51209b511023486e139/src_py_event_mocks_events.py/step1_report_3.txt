{
  "purpose": "The code appears to load and merge JSON event template files based on event types, likely for configuring or processing event data.",
  "sources": "The code reads JSON files from the filesystem, specifically from paths constructed based on the event type.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct sinks such as network transmission, database writing, or command execution. Data merging occurs internally without external output.",
  "flows": "Input event_type influences the filename path; this file is opened and loaded; optional body data is merged into the JSON content; result is returned.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious logic. The filename construction is straightforward and based on input, which could be manipulated if untrusted input is used externally.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically constructs a filename from the event_type parameter, replacing colons with slashes and appending '-template.json'. It then reads and loads this JSON file, merging additional data if provided. The merging uses an 'additive' strategy, which is standard for combining JSON data structures. No external network communication, system modification, or obfuscated code is present. The code appears to be a utility for managing event templates with no apparent malicious intent or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard file-based JSON loading and merging based on event types with no malicious behavior or security threats detected. Its simplicity and straightforward logic suggest it is safe, assuming the event_type input is sanitized if coming from an untrusted source.",
