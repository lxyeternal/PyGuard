{
  "purpose": "Import a specific object or function from the 'events' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads the 'events' module to access 'ekbmNmmafuaHsXugALNrMErJtFgrBESh'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially using the imported object elsewhere; no direct untrusted data sink observed in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads the 'events' module, then accesses 'ekbmNmmafuaHsXugALNrMErJtFgrBESh'.",
  "anomalies": "The imported object name 'ekbmNmmafuaHsXugALNrMErJtFgrBESh' appears to be a nonsensical, random string, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No other code present to clarify its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import statement from the 'events' module. The object name is a long, nonsensical string, which is suspicious and may suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. There are no other code actions, data handling, or security-sensitive operations visible. Without additional context, this import could be benign or part of malicious obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code alone is minimal but the imported object's name raises suspicion due to its randomness, which might be used to hide malicious behavior or obfuscate intent. Further analysis of the 'events' module and usage of 'ekbmNmmafuaHsXugALNrMErJtFgrBESh' is necessary to determine malicious intent.",
