  "purpose": "Import a specific object or function from a local module named 'events'.",
  "sources": "The code imports 'ekbmNmmafuaHsXugALNrMErJtFgrBESh' from a local module 'events'.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present in this snippet; it only performs an import.",
  "flows": "N/A – this is a single import statement with no data flow from source to sink beyond the module import.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'ekbmNmmafuaHsXugALNrMErJtFgrBESh' appears to be a random or obfuscated identifier, which may suggest obfuscation or concealment of malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a symbol with a highly obfuscated name from a local module. There are no other operations, data processing, or external communications. The obfuscated name could be benign if the code is intentionally obscured, but it could also be indicative of malicious intent or an attempt to hide malicious functionality. Without additional context, the use of such a random name warrants suspicion. The code is minimal and does not show malicious actions directly, but the obfuscation raises concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple import statement with an unusually obfuscated identifier. While it does not demonstrate malicious behavior directly, the obfuscation could be used to conceal malicious functionality or backdoors. Further review of the surrounding code and context is recommended.",
