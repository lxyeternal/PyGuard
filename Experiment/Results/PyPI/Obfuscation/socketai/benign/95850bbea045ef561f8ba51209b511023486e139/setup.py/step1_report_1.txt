{
  "purpose": "To set up and install a Python package using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Importing the 'setup' function from the 'setuptools' library.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain any sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present; the code merely calls setup() with default parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, straightforward, and standard for Python package setup. No anomalies or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and executes setup() without any arguments. This is typical for a minimal setup script. There are no hardcoded credentials, no dynamic code execution, and no data input or external network interactions. The script does not include obfuscation, malicious behavior, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard minimal setup script for Python packaging with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
