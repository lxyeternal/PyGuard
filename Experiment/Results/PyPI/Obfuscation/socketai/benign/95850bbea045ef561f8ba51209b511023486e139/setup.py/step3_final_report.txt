  "purpose": "Minimal setup script for Python packaging using setuptools.",
  "sources": "Import statement from setuptools module.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external inputs; no data leaks or effects.",
  "flows": "Import of setup function, invocation with no arguments; no data flow to external systems.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or unusual patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward, standard minimal setup script. It imports 'setup' from 'setuptools' and calls it without arguments, which is common in Python packaging. There are no data inputs, network activity, or dynamic code execution. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The code's simplicity and standard pattern indicate a benign purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly assess its harmless nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The assessments are consistent and appropriate given the code's straightforward structure.",
