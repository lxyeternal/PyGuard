      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal setup script with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports correctly assess its harmless nature, assigning malware scores of 0, obfuscated scores of 0, and very low security risk scores. The assessments are consistent and appropriate given the code's straightforward structure."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The import statement itself is benign; the obfuscated name warrants further review of the 'events' module. Current scores are appropriate given the limited information, with suspicion primarily due to obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity is present at this stage, but caution is advised until further analysis confirms the nature of the imported object."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward JSON template loader with an obfuscation aspect and a minor security concern regarding unvalidated input leading to potential path traversal. There is no malware or malicious behavior present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; I recommend implementing input validation to mitigate the path traversal risk but otherwise consider the code safe."
