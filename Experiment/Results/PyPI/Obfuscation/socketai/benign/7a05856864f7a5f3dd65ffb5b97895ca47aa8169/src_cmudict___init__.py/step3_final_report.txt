{
  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading and parsing linguistic resource files such as dictionaries, phonemes, symbols, and license information.",
  "sources": "Resource files and local data files read via resource management functions.",
  "sinks": "No external network, system modifications, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from resource files into in-memory data structures through parsing functions.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and function names, no user input or network activity, which is suspicious but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily a set of resource loaders and parsers for linguistic data, with no signs of malicious activity such as network communication, code injection, or system modification. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment or minification purposes. The functions handle internal data processing only, and no external or untrusted input is processed. The high obfuscation score is justified by the nonsensical variable names, but the malware score remains low due to the lack of malicious behavior. The overall structure indicates a benign utility module with obfuscation as the main concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign resource loader for linguistic data, with heavy obfuscation that raises suspicion but no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The low malware score and low to moderate risk score are appropriate, and the obfuscation score is justified.",
