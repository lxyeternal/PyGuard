  "purpose": "Initialize an SvtImageApi instance with a dependency parameter for testing purposes.",
  "sources": "The parameter 'SnHtLNDxUZUNqQiWprdIMIAWKJBCvgcG' used to instantiate SvtImageApi.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data or external data flows; no data leaks or malicious sinks present.",
  "flows": "Input parameter flows directly into SvtImageApi constructor; no further data flow or processing observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no other anomalies or suspicious behaviors detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward pytest fixture that creates an API instance with a parameter. The parameter name is obfuscated, which could suggest auto-generation or intentional obfuscation but does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The code performs no operations beyond object instantiation, and the import statements are standard. The obfuscation score is moderate due to variable naming but does not imply malicious behavior. The malware score is zero, consistent with the benign nature. The security risk is minimal, given the simplicity and lack of external interactions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign test fixture with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is likely due to auto-generation or code obfuscation practices but does not pose a security threat. Scores should reflect low malware risk (0), moderate obfuscation (around 0.6), and minimal security risk (~0.1).",
