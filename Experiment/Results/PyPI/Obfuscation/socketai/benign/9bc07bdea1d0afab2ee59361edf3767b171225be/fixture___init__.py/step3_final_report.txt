  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source Python dependency based on provided reports, focusing on malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "No code provided; limited data, primarily assessments and descriptions.",
  "sinks": "Potential external interactions, environment variables, input/output functions, network/file operations (mentioned but not evidenced).",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables/input to network or file sinks, but no concrete flows are demonstrated due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious anomalies or hardcoded secrets identified; reports acknowledge limited visibility.",
  "analysis": "All reports lack actual code snippets, limiting definitive analysis. Scores for malware and obfuscation are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of suspicious features. Risk scores are low (~0.2), justified by benign descriptions and lack of evidence. Confidence levels range from 0.6 to 0.9, appropriate given the limited data. Some reports suggest potential external interactions but do not identify concrete vulnerabilities or malicious intent. Recommendations include maintaining current low scores and updating risk assessments if code or suspicious patterns are provided.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation, with low security risk. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the reports' content. No further action is necessary unless new code or evidence emerges.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
