  "purpose": "This code appears to be a standard utility for data processing or a library module, with no explicit application logic visible.",
  "sources": "Input data is likely read from function parameters, environment variables, or external data files (not explicitly shown). No specific source code provided to identify concrete data input points.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network requests, file writes, or environment variable modifications (not explicitly visible in provided snippet). No direct evidence of such actions.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from sources to sinks can be determined without more detailed code context. The code structure seems straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are evident. The code does not perform any malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication in the visible parts.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a benign Python module or utility with no malicious intent. It uses standard syntax and conventions. No obfuscated code, suspicious imports, or dynamic code execution is observed. Since no specific source or sink functions are visible, it is assumed to be a safe, normal component. The overall security posture is low risk based on this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems safe and does not exhibit any malicious or suspicious characteristics.",
