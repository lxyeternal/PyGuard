  "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated async HTTP client wrapper with no explicit malicious activity detected. Obfuscation is high, which warrants caution, but no evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The current scores (malware ~0.1, obfuscated ~0.75, risk ~0.3) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
