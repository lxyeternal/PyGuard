  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, network requests, subprocess calls, environment variables like 'API_KEY'.",
  "sinks": "Network endpoints, system commands, file outputs, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input sources (environment variables, user inputs) to sinks (network, subprocess, file operations).",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for secrets, subprocess and network operations without explicit input validation, no obfuscation or hardcoded secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets show typical data handling and network interactions. No malicious code such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads is evident. The use of environment variables and subprocess calls introduces potential security concerns if inputs are untrusted, but no active malicious activity is detected. The absence of obfuscation and malicious patterns supports a benign assessment. The risk primarily stems from potential injection or misuse if inputs are maliciously crafted, warranting a moderate security risk score.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity. The main concern is potential injection or misuse due to unvalidated inputs, but no active threats are present. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with a slight increase in security risk for the report highlighting input handling vulnerabilities.",
