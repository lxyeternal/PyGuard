  "purpose": "A standard Python setup script for package configuration, with obfuscated variable names and a potentially secret string, but no malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Reading README.md file, import from 'nhm_spider.settings.default_settings', setup() parameters including a hardcoded string.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; no network activity or code execution observed.",
  "flows": "Reading README.md -> setup() call with parameters; import from settings module (unused) -> setup() parameters including a string that could be a secret.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, unusual string assignments, import from settings module not used, presence of a hardcoded string 'spby0dor0k6w5bek'.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with superficial obfuscation and a hardcoded string that may be a secret. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration detected. Obfuscation appears cosmetic rather than malicious. The import from settings is unused, which could be benign or suspicious. The hardcoded string warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation and potential secrets embedded. No evidence of malware or malicious activity. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation and embedded string should be reviewed further for security hygiene.",
