  "purpose": "Import modules/functions from the 'nhm_spider' package, likely for web crawling or data extraction tasks.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing obfuscated modules and functions/classes from 'nhm_spider'.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow or execution paths are demonstrated; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and function/class names, which could conceal malicious intent but are also common in proprietary or security-focused code.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated identifiers, with no executable logic, data processing, or network activity shown. The high obfuscation scores are justified due to the nonsensical names, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The malware score should be zero, as no malicious actions are demonstrated. The security risk remains low, but the obfuscation warrants cautious review. The scores across reports are consistent with the evidence, and no active threats are apparent in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in isolation, containing only obfuscated import statements without any malicious activity or vulnerabilities. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no concrete evidence of malicious intent. Further analysis of the imported modules and subsequent code execution is necessary for a comprehensive security assessment.",
