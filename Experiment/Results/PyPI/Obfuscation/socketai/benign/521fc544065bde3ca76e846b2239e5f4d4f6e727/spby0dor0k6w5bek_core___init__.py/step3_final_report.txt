  "purpose": "Assess the supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing provided code snippets for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, network communication, file operations, environment variables, and external library usage.",
  "sinks": "Network transmissions, file writes, subprocess calls, environment variable access, and data leaks.",
  "flows": "Sources such as input or environment variables to sinks like network or file operations, potentially indicating malicious data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded credentials, suspicious network domains, obfuscated code, unnecessary dynamic execution, or unusual variable naming.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets across all reports are either minimal, empty, or standard scripts with no suspicious patterns. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscation is absent, and security risks are minimal (around 0.1 to 0.2). Confidence levels are appropriate given the limited context. No anomalous behaviors or malicious indicators are detected. The scores align with the benign assessments, with a slight adjustment in Report 1's risk score from 0.2 to 0.1 to better reflect the minimal threat level.",
  "conclusion": "All reports are consistent and indicate no malicious activity or obfuscation. The overall security posture is benign, with very low risk scores. Minor adjustment in Report 1's risk score improves accuracy. No further action required unless additional code or context is provided.",
