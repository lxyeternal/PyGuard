  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and a class for handling settings with validation info.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources; code defines classes and constants.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leak points; no untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; class methods are simple and do not process external input.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-like class and variable names; no evident malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or suspicious code segments.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of class and enum definitions with cryptic naming, which could suggest obfuscation. The classes inherit from exception and custom exception subclasses. The main class includes a string representation method that outputs debug info. No data input, network activity, or data processing occurs. No suspicious logic, external calls, or sensitive data handling identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility classes and enums with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. No external data processing, network communication, or hardcoded secrets detected.",
