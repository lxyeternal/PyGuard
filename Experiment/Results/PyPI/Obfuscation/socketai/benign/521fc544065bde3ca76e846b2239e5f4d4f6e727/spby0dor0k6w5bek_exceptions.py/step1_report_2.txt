{
  "purpose": "Defines several custom exception classes, an enum, and a class for settings validation, likely used for configuration or error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data input, environment variables, or data sources detected in the code.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks or data outputs that process untrusted data; no network or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code primarily declares classes and constants without data flow logic.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-looking class names and variable names, but no malicious code or backdoors are evident. The class attributes appear to be constants or configuration parameters.",
  "analysis": "The code defines several custom exception classes inheriting from built-in exceptions, and an enum with a non-English string. The class 'iGzDHXccPammTBovQEyUiqmNOJclrmsi' manages internal state related to settings validation and provides a string representation. No external input handling, network operations, or cryptic behavior are present. The variable names seem deliberately obfuscated, but this alone is insufficient to indicate malicious intent. There are no code injection points, no suspicious data leaks, or behaviors typical of malware. The code appears to be part of a larger application’s configuration or error handling module without any malicious characteristics.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit malicious behavior, supply chain security risks, or obfuscation indicative of malware. It primarily consists of class and enum definitions with obfuscated identifiers, which is common in proprietary or intentionally obscured code but does not imply malicious intent.",
