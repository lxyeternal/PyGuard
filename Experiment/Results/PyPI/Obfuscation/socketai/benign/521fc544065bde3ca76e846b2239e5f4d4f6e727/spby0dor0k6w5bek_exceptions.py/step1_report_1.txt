{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and an enum for object types, along with a class for handling settings with type validation.",
  "sources": "Class constructors (__init__), string representations (__str__), and class attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data leak points; no external resource access or untrusted data processing observed.",
  "flows": "No evident data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks; mostly class and attribute definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of classes with obfuscated or non-descriptive names; class attributes contain seemingly random strings; no apparent user input or data parsing observed.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of class definitions, including an enum and several custom exceptions, some with obfuscated or non-meaningful names. The class 'iGzDHXccPammTBovQEyUiqmNOJclrmsi' includes a constructor that stores key, value, and type but does not perform any operations beyond attribute assignment and a formatted string. There are no external inputs, network operations, or dynamic code execution present. The attributes with seemingly random strings do not exhibit malicious behavior or suspicious logic. The code appears to serve as structural or configuration scaffolding rather than functional or malicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is largely structural, with no signs of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. Its obfuscated class names and random attribute values do not indicate malicious intent but may suggest code obfuscation or lack of clarity. There are no active data flows, external communications, or suspicious logic detected.",
