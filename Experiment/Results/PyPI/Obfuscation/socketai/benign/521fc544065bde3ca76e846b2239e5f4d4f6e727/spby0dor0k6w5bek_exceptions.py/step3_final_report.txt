{
  "purpose": "The code defines several classes, including an enum for object types, custom exception classes, and a settings class with attributes and a string representation method.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, enum declarations, and constant string assignments within classes.",
  "sinks": "No external data inputs, network connections, or data processing functions are present; thus, no sinks exist.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code is purely structural with attribute assignments and class definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names, non-descriptive identifiers, and the presence of random strings suggest obfuscation but no malicious activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class and enum definitions with obfuscated naming conventions. No external data handling, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed. The classes serve as structural or configuration scaffolding. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not imply malicious intent. The absence of suspicious logic, data leaks, or external interactions indicates a benign nature. The obfuscated identifiers are consistent with code that may be auto-generated or protected, but they do not exhibit malicious patterns such as backdoors, data exfiltration, or system disruption.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, primarily structural with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is likely for proprietary or protective reasons rather than malicious intent. The supply chain security risk is minimal.",
