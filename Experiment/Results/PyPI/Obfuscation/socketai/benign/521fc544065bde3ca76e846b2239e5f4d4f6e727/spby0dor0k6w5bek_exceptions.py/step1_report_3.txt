  "purpose": "Define custom exceptions and an enum class for handling specific object types and error conditions.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading detected.",
  "sinks": "No potential data leak points or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flows from sources to sinks; primarily class and exception definitions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of class names with seemingly random characters and obfuscated-looking variable names; no clear malicious intent or suspicious behavior in code logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with a non-English string, several custom exception classes, and a class that appears to handle configuration or settings with private attributes. The class __str__ method provides formatted output, and some classes inherit from custom exceptions. No network activity, code injection, or suspicious data handling present. The naming conventions are unusual but do not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code patterns are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of utility or configuration classes with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is likely part of a larger application framework. The unusual naming does not imply malicious intent but suggests obfuscation or code generated programmatically.",
