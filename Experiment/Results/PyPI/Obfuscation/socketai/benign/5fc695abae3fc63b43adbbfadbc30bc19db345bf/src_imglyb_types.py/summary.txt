  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility for type mapping in image processing, with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity or vulnerabilities. The malware score should be 0, and the security risk score should be low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation. It warrants cautious review in a supply chain context but is not inherently malicious."
