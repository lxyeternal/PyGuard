  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate high-performance data conversion utility with significant obfuscation and unsafe memory access. There is no evidence of malicious intent or payloads, but the obfuscation and unsafe memory operations should be monitored. The malware score remains at 0, with a higher obfuscation score (~0.75) and a low security risk (~0.3)."
