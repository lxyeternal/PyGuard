  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high complexity, obfuscation, and unsafe low-level memory handling, which elevate security risks. However, there is no direct evidence of malicious payloads. The overall security risk is moderate to high, with a low to moderate malware likelihood. The current scores are justified and reflect the potential for misuse if the code is exploited or misused."
