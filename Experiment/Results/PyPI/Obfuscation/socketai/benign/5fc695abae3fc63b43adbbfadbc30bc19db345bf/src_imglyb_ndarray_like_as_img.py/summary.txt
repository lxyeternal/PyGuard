  "malware_score": 0.6,
  "security_risk": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates significant obfuscation and unsafe memory handling, which could be exploited maliciously. While no explicit malicious activity is evident, the patterns observed warrant caution. The overall security risk is moderate to high, and the malware likelihood is elevated due to the obfuscation and unsafe operations."
