  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malicious payloads but poses a high security risk due to executing external scripts or modules without validation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. No malware is detected. The obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. The overall security risk score should be around 0.6, reflecting the danger of unvalidated dynamic code execution in supply chain contexts. Malware score remains 0."
