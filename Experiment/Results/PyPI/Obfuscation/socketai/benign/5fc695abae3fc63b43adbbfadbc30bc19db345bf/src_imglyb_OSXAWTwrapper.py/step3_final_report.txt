  "purpose": "A wrapper script that executes external Python scripts or modules specified via command-line arguments, and optionally initializes a macOS GUI application using PyObjC and AppKit.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments for script/module names, environment variables, imported modules such as runpy, objc, AppKit, and AppHelper.",
  "sinks": "runpy.run_path and runpy.run_module functions for executing external code, GUI event loop via AppHelper.runEventLoop().",
  "flows": "User supplies script/module name -> code executes via runpy -> GUI event loop runs (if applicable).",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, dynamic execution of user input without validation, minimal input validation, no validation of external scripts, no sandboxing or validation mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The script accepts user input via command-line arguments to specify scripts or modules to run, executing them dynamically with runpy without validation. It also sets up a macOS GUI application using PyObjC, which appears benign. The primary security concern is executing untrusted external code, which could be malicious if inputs are compromised. The obfuscated variable names are suspicious but not inherently malicious. No network activity or malicious payloads are present. The code's structure and logic are straightforward, but the lack of validation introduces a significant security risk in untrusted environments.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself does not contain malicious payloads but poses a high security risk due to executing external scripts or modules without validation, which could be exploited for malicious purposes. No malware is detected. The obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. The overall security risk score should be around 0.6, reflecting the danger of unvalidated dynamic code execution in supply chain contexts. Malware score remains 0.",
