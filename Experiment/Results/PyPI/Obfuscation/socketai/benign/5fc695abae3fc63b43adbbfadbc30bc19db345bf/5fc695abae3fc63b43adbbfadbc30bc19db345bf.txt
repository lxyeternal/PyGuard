There is no direct evidence of malware or malicious payloads. The overall risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic behavior, but the current evidence does not indicate active malicious intent."

While no explicit malicious activity is evident, the patterns observed warrant caution. The overall security risk is moderate to high, and the malware likelihood is elevated due to the obfuscation and unsafe operations."

No malware is detected. The obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. The overall security risk score should be around 0.6, reflecting the danger of unvalidated dynamic code execution in supply chain contexts. Malware score remains 0."
