  "purpose": "The code appears to retrieve a version number for a package or component, possibly for configuration or compatibility checks, and allows updating and retrieving this version via environment variables and functions.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'IMGLIB2_IMGLYB_VERSION' and the get_version('imglyb') function call",
  "sinks": "The variable UssDUddiCsqBTWRtfBovdWabADnncvtZ is overwritten by external inputs, which could influence subsequent code behavior if used elsewhere",
  "flows": "get_version('imglyb') -> assignment to internal variable -> optional override via environment variable -> update function BzBpUPZbdgSSIXLziOHVQBBRyKIrayrz -> retrieval function zQTSRhCaqSyPcpXtdEwcUMqEvlqnGHkm",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable names and function names; no immediate malicious code execution or suspicious behavior evident; the code simply manages a version variable",
  "analysis": "The code imports a version function and retrieves a version string, then sets a default or environment-provided version. It defines a setter and getter for this version, with obfuscated identifiers. There are no network operations, data exfiltration, or malicious code present. The obfuscation appears to be an attempt to hide simple version management logic, not malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious operations are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily concerned with managing a version variable through environment variables and functions, with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in this snippet.",
