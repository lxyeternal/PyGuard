  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with hardcoded string attributes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data reads observed.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data output or effect seen.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple classes with unusual class names and long, seemingly random string attributes; no clear functional purpose or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three custom exception classes inheriting from Exception, each with a single class attribute assigned a seemingly random string. The class names are obfuscated and do not follow typical naming conventions. The string attributes are also random and hard to interpret, with no functions or methods that utilize these attributes. There are no data inputs, network operations, or other typical behaviors associated with malicious activity. The code appears to be obfuscated or intentionally meaningless, possibly as a form of code camouflage or placeholder code, but it does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security threats.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists of obfuscated class definitions with no operational logic, data handling, or malicious activity detected. It appears benign but intentionally obscure, likely for obfuscation or placeholder purposes.",
