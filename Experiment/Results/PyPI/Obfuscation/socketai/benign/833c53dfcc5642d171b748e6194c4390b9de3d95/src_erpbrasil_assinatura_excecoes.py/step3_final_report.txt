  "purpose": "Static definition of obfuscated exception classes with embedded string constants, likely for concealment or obfuscation purposes.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments within each exception class, containing static string literals.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, input/output, or external interactions; no sinks present.",
  "flows": "None; static constants with no data flow or external influence.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and attribute values; no active logic or data processing; static strings that appear random or nonsensical.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names and static string attributes. There are no functions, data flows, network calls, or dynamic behaviors. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal intent, but in isolation, the code is benign. The static nature and lack of active malicious actions indicate low suspicion. The obfuscation could be used to hide malicious payloads elsewhere, but this cannot be confirmed without additional context. The scores assigned in the reports (malware around 0.2 or 0, security risk low, obfuscation high) are consistent with this static, obfuscated, but seemingly harmless code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated but does not exhibit active malicious behavior or vulnerabilities in isolation. The scores in the reports are appropriate and conservative. Unless additional context indicates malicious activity elsewhere, the code appears benign.",
