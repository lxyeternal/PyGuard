  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with hardcoded string attributes, possibly for identification or categorization purposes.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read; attributes are assigned static string values within class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows to untrusted destinations or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; classes only define static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated class names and attribute values that appear to be random strings; no clear functional purpose or documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with cryptic names. Each class has a single class variable assigned a seemingly random string. The code does not perform any operations, input/output, or data handling. The obfuscated class and variable names, combined with the static string attributes, could be used to hide malicious intent or serve as markers. However, without additional context or code, these classes alone do not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. They are unusual but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to define obfuscated custom exceptions with static data attributes. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks within this fragment alone. The obfuscation could be suspicious if part of a larger malicious framework, but based solely on this snippet, it is likely benign.",
