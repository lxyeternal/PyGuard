{
  "purpose": "Defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated attribute values, potentially for internal error handling.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks, system modifications, or external communications are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows; the code only defines classes and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "The class names and attribute names are obfuscated and resemble intentionally scrambled code. No obvious functional logic or external interactions. The attribute values appear as random strings, possibly indicating obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, each with a single class attribute set to a seemingly random string. There are no functions, no input/output, no network operations, or other suspicious activity. The obfuscated naming could be an attempt at hiding malicious intent, but without any active behavior or external interactions, the code appears benign. The presence of obfuscation alone does not imply malicious behavior; it could be for code protection or stylistic reasons. No malicious code, backdoors, data exfiltration, or harmful actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely benign and consists solely of obfuscated class definitions for custom exceptions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks within this fragment.",
