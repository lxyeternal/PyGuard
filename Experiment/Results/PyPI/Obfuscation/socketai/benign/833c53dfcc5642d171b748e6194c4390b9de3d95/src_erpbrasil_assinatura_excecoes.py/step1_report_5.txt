  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with hidden string attributes.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and attribute assignments.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks for untrusted data or malicious activity.",
  "flows": "Class attributes are assigned static strings; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and attribute values appear obfuscated or nonsensical; no external data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three custom exception classes, each with an attribute assigned a seemingly random string. There are no input sources, no data processing, no network calls, or other typical malicious behaviors. The obfuscated class and attribute names suggest possible concealment, but without dynamic execution, external data handling, or suspicious logic, this appears to be obfuscated but benign code. No indications of malicious intent, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are observed.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists of obfuscated exception class definitions with static attributes. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. It may be intentionally obfuscated, but based on the provided fragment, it appears harmless.",
