  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with embedded hardcoded string constants.",
  "sources": "Class attribute assignments within each exception class.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks that process untrusted data or perform harmful actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; classes only define constants.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of multiple obfuscated-looking class names and attribute names, with seemingly random string constants; no clear functional purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three custom exception classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. Each class contains a class attribute assigned a seemingly random string. There is no actual logic, data processing, or usage shown. The use of obfuscated identifiers and hardcoded strings could be intended to hide malicious intent or data, but as presented, these are static constants within exception classes. No functions, input processing, or network operations are present. The code appears to be obfuscated but does not perform any malicious actions by itself. It may be part of a larger malicious payload or attempt to hide malicious intent via obfuscation, but in isolation, it lacks active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "This code consists solely of obfuscated class definitions with hardcoded strings, without any active malicious behavior or security threats. However, the obfuscation and hidden strings could be a sign of intent to conceal malicious payloads elsewhere. Caution is advised if part of a larger codebase, but based solely on this snippet, no malicious actions are detectable.",
