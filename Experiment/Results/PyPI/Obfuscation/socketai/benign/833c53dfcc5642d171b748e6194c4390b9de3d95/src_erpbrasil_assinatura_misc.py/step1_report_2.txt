  "purpose": "Generate a self-signed X.509 certificate with an RSA private key, serialize it with encryption, and encode it in base64.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the function: JgsFeRNmHZaXcrfiiOqOsisKpCtOfCgX, DuxhhcekhhVnJQGwcoMuBQFgCxveWzzQ, nCXziqeFXjQmBhmnlLZmjZLpwacUvNGd, jsPzuWZjiNQyBTUCGmdJgDcjxdqEOcYL, MobNTVkrxBggdgyAmxRcFAngqXYTgfdo",
  "sinks": "Serialization function serialize_key_and_certificates, base64 encoding of the output",
  "flows": "Parameters provided to the function → certificate builder attributes and validity period calculations → key serialization → final base64 encoding",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamically generated variables with obfuscated or non-descriptive names, repeated function calls with complex date logic, and a high level of code complexity that obscures intent",
  "analysis": "The code generates an RSA private key and creates a self-signed certificate with specified subject and issuer details. It sets validity periods based on input flags, serializes the key and certificate, encrypts the private key with a provided password, and encodes the output in base64. Variable names are obfuscated, and the date calculation logic is convoluted, likely to hide the purpose. The code does not connect to external servers or perform any network activity, nor does it contain obvious backdoors or malicious data theft mechanisms.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard certificate generation routine with obfuscated variable names and complex date logic. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or sabotage. Its primary purpose is to generate and serialize cryptographic material, which is common in secure applications.",
