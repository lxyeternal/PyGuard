  "purpose": "The function generates an RSA private key, creates a self-signed X.509 certificate with specified subject and issuer details, and serializes the key and certificate into a PKCS#12 archive, then encodes it in base64.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: JgsFeRNmHZaXcrfiiOqOsisKpCtOfCgX, DuxhhcekhhVnJQGwcoMuBQFgCxveWzzQ, nCXziqeFXjQmBhmnlLZmjZLpwacUvNGd, jsPzuWZjiNQyBTUCGmdJgDcjxdqEOcYL, MobNTVkrxBggdgyAmxRcFAngqXYTgfdo",
  "sinks": "Serialization functions (serialize_key_and_certificates) with sensitive data; encoding the output in base64; use of cryptography library functions",
  "flows": "Input parameters used for certificate subject/issuer details and encryption password -> RSA key and certificate generation -> serialization -> base64 encoding",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names that seem obfuscated; the function dynamically creates and signs a self-signed certificate; use of timestamp logic to set certificate validity period; no external network activity or data leakage observed",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that creates an RSA private key and a self-signed X.509 certificate with customizable subject and issuer details, and with validity periods adjusted based on an input boolean flag. The generated key and certificate are serialized into a PKCS#12 archive, encrypted with a provided password, then base64-encoded for output. The code appears to perform standard cryptographic operations without any network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Variable names are obfuscated, but the operations are consistent with legitimate certificate handling. No malicious behaviors, such as secret theft or malicious communication, are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard implementation for generating and packaging a self-signed certificate with a private key, with no apparent malicious intent. Obfuscated variable names and internal logic do not indicate sabotage or malware. Overall security risk is minimal.",
