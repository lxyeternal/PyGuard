  "conclusion": "The code is a benign cryptographic utility with obfuscated variable names and some date handling issues. There is no evidence of malware, malicious sabotage, or malicious data exfiltration. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the overall security risk remains low. The malware score should be set to 0, with an obfuscation score around 0.75, and a low security risk score (~0.2)."
