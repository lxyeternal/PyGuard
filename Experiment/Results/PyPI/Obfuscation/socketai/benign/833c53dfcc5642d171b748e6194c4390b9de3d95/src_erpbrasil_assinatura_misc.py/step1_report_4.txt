{
  "purpose": "Generate a self-signed X.509 certificate, serialize it along with a private key, encrypting the private key with a password, and encode the result in base64.",
  "sources": "Function parameters providing strings for subject/issuer names and password; internal library functions generating keys and certificates; environment or external input is not directly read.",
  "sinks": "Serialization of key and certificate data; encryption of private key with user-provided password; outputting base64-encoded certificate bundle.",
  "flows": "Parameters used for certificate subject, issuer, and encryption password flow into serialization and encryption functions; key generation and certificate signing are internal operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; conditional date adjustments based on input parameter; dynamic certificate validity period; no hardcoded secrets or credentials; no external network communication or data exfiltration observed.",
  "analysis": "The code generates an RSA private key and creates a self-signed X.509 certificate with specified subject and issuer attributes. It sets certificate validity based on a boolean parameter, signs the certificate with SHA3-512, serializes the key and certificate, encrypts the private key with a password provided as a parameter, and encodes the final PKCS12 bundle in base64. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network communication, backdoors, or data leaks is evident. The variable names are deliberately obscure, but their usage appears consistent with standard cryptographic procedures. The code primarily performs cryptographic key and certificate management, typical for secure applications.",
  "conclusion": "This code implements standard cryptographic operations for generating a self-signed certificate and encrypted key package. It contains obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious intent or malicious behavior. It is a typical utility for secure certificate handling without evident security risks or malware activity.",
