  "purpose": "Import necessary modules for digital signature and certificate handling from the erpbrasil library",
  "sources": "Import statements from erpbrasil.assinatura modules",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data usage identified",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only import statements with obfuscated identifiers",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and module names; no clear purpose or explanation for such naming conventions; no visible functionality or data handling",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from the erpbrasil library, with variable and module names intentionally obfuscated. There are no functions, data processing, or network calls. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide functionality, but without additional code, no malicious activity can be determined. The presence of imports related to digital signatures and certificates is typical for security-related modules but does not imply malicious intent by itself. The code does not show any malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or system compromise.",
  "conclusion": "This code only imports obfuscated modules from a legitimate library related to signatures and certificates. No malicious activity or security risks are evident based on these imports alone. The obfuscation might be suspicious, but without further context or code, it is not possible to conclude malicious intent.",
