  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, involving only module imports from a legitimate package with obfuscated variable names that do not indicate malicious activity. The malware score is set to 0, and security risk is very low. The obfuscation level is moderate but not sufficient to suggest malicious intent without further context."
