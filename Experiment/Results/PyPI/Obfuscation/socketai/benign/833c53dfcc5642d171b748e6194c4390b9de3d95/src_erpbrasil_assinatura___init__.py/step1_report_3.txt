  "purpose": "Importing modules related to digital signature and certificate handling from the erpbrasil library.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'erpbrasil.assinatura' modules.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow from source to sink identified.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual behavior are present.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports specific modules related to digital signature and certificate management. The variable assignment at the start appears to be a version string or a placeholder. The imports seem standard for a library dealing with digital signatures. No dynamic execution, network activity, or suspicious behavior is evident. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a normal import setup for digital signature operations with no malicious intent or security risks detected.",
