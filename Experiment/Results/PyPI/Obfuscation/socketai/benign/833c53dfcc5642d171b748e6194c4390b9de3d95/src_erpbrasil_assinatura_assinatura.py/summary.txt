  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate cryptographic utility for signing and verifying XML and PDF documents. Obfuscation is present but appears to serve concealment rather than malicious sabotage. No evidence of malicious activity, backdoors, or vulnerabilities is detected. The assigned scores—malware=0, obfuscated=0.75, risk=0.2—are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
