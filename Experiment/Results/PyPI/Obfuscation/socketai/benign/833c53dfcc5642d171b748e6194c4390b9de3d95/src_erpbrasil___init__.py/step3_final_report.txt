  "purpose": "Declare namespace package using pkg_resources or pkgutil fallback.",
  "sources": "The top comment line, which appears obfuscated or random, but is a comment and does not influence execution.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted input, data leaks, or external system interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code simply declares a namespace.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or seemingly random comment line at the top; no impact on code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Python namespace declaration pattern. The comment line is obfuscated but is a comment only, not affecting execution. No external inputs, network activity, or malicious code detected. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly a marker or signature, but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is minor (~0.2-0.3), and security risk is minimal (~0.1-0.2).",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a typical namespace package declaration with superficial obfuscation in comments. No malicious activity or security issues are present based on this fragment.",
