  "purpose": "Cryptographic certificate and key management, loading from files, bytes, or strings, and exposing certificate attributes.",
  "sources": "File system (reading certificate files), base64 decoding, in-memory bytes/strings",
  "sinks": "Temporary files for private keys and certificates, property accessors for certificate details",
  "flows": "Input data (file/bytes/string) -> load certificates/keys -> expose properties -> write to temp files",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, suspicious method `datetime.datetime.DZmkqfWUUEtouraDXLfGhtrVgmDLJXyv()` which is invalid syntax, potential code errors or obfuscation",
  "analysis": "The code handles cryptographic certificates, loading them from various sources, decoding, and creating temporary files for keys and certificates. The obfuscated naming and the invalid syntax in the expiration check suggest obfuscation or code corruption. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system sabotage is evident. The use of temp files for sensitive data is standard but should be managed securely. The obfuscation and syntax issues warrant caution but do not directly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a certificate management utility with obfuscation that could be used to hide malicious behavior, but no evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. The primary concern is the obfuscation and handling of sensitive data, which should be reviewed for security best practices. The syntax anomalies suggest obfuscation or errors but do not imply malicious intent.",
