  "purpose": "The code prints the command-line arguments received by the script.",
  "sources": "The 'argv' parameter, which defaults to sys.argv, reading input from the command line.",
  "sinks": "The print function, which outputs the 'argv' data to standard output.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sys.argv (source) to the print function (sink), displaying command-line inputs.",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'ObBOWNEFRqBPhWZNWnRXmXCKkxyLwqqc' appears obfuscated and does not indicate a clear purpose. No hardcoded credentials, malicious code, or suspicious behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a function that prints command-line arguments. The obfuscated function name raises suspicion but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The code does not perform any network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification. It simply outputs provided arguments, which is typical in debugging or informational scripts. No other anomalies or malicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a straightforward task of printing command-line arguments. The obfuscated function name is suspicious but not malicious in this context. No malware or security risks are evident.",
