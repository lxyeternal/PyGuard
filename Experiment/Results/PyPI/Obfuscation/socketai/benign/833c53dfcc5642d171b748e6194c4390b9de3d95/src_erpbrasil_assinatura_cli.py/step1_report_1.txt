  "purpose": "The function appears to print the command-line arguments passed to the script.",
  "sources": "sys.argv, which is a standard way to access command-line arguments",
  "sinks": "print(argv), which outputs the arguments to standard output",
  "flows": "sys.argv (source) → print(argv) (sink)",
  "anomalies": "The function name 'ObBOWNEFRqBPhWZNWnRXmXCKkxyLwqqc' is obfuscated and not descriptive. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code are present. The function simply prints command-line arguments.",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and defines a function with a long, nonsensical name that takes command-line arguments or defaults to sys.argv. It prints the arguments to stdout. No data is sent over the network, stored insecurely, or used maliciously. The obfuscated function name might be suspicious, but it does not indicate malicious intent itself. The code's behavior is benign and typical for debugging or informational purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is harmless and simply outputs command-line arguments. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
