  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that prints command-line arguments passed to it.",
  "sources": "The code reads command-line arguments via the sys.argv list.",
  "sinks": "The code prints the arguments to the standard output.",
  "flows": "sys.argv (input) -> print(argv) (output)",
  "anomalies": "The function name is a nonsensical string, possibly obfuscated or auto-generated. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious logic are evident. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The script imports the sys module and defines a function that takes command-line arguments (defaulting to sys.argv). It prints the arguments and returns 0. There are no suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection. The function name appears obfuscated but that alone is not malicious. The code does not perform any harmful operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign, serving solely to print command-line arguments. No signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are present.",
