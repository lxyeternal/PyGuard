  "purpose": "A function that prints command-line arguments, likely for debugging or informational purposes.",
  "sources": "sys.argv (command-line arguments)",
  "sinks": "print(argv) (outputs to stdout)",
  "flows": "sys.argv (source) -> print (sink)",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function name; no malicious code or network activity present",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys, defines a function with an obfuscated name that defaults argv to sys.argv, and prints the arguments. The behavior is benign, with no network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious operations. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, with scores reflecting low risk and no malware detected. The obfuscation score is moderate due to the naming, but the overall behavior is safe.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious activity detected. The obfuscated function name is suspicious but not malicious. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score is zero. The obfuscation score is moderate, reflecting suspicion but not evidence of malicious intent.",
