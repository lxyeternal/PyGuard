  "purpose": "Prints the command-line arguments received by the script",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments via sys.argv",
  "sinks": "Print statement outputs to stdout",
  "flows": "sys.argv (source) -> print() (sink)",
  "anomalies": "The function name appears obfuscated and non-descriptive; no other suspicious code is present. The function does nothing malicious but the name could be used to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the sys module and defines a function with an obfuscated name that takes command-line arguments as input (defaulting to sys.argv). It prints these arguments to standard output and returns 0. No other code, data leaks, network activity, or malicious behaviors are present. The obfuscated function name could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but in this context, it appears benign. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious data flows are observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and appears harmless, primarily printing command-line arguments. The obfuscated function name is unusual but does not inherently indicate malicious intent or malicious behavior. There is no evidence of malware or security risks.",
