  "purpose": "A wrapper function that formats Python code strings using the 'black' formatter.",
  "sources": "The 'unformatted' string input to the function.",
  "sinks": "The 'black.format_str' function processes the input; no untrusted data is executed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "Input 'unformatted' flows into 'black.format_str' which returns formatted code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; unused version string variable; '_info_str' parameter is unused.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a legitimate formatting library 'black' and defines a function that formats a code string. The variable names are obfuscated, but the code does not execute untrusted code, connect to networks, or perform malicious actions. The unused variable and parameter suggest obfuscation or placeholder code but do not introduce security risks. The function's purpose is benign, simply formatting code snippets. No vulnerabilities, malicious behaviors, or malicious patterns are present. The obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0.2-0.3, risk=0.1) are consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility that formats code snippets using 'black'. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious activity. No security issues or malicious behaviors are present. The current scores are appropriate; the malware score remains at 0, obfuscation score around 0.2-0.3, and risk score at 0.1.",
