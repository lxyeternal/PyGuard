{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a simple utility that formats Python code strings using the Black formatter library.",
  "sources": "The code reads input through the 'unformatted' parameter of the 'KuDrFIdzxTQTuYUccVACNBCpRfMrkBde' function.",
  "sinks": "The code calls 'black.format_str', which processes the input string; no external data sinks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input string 'unformatted' flows into 'black.format_str', which returns a formatted version. No other data flows or external communications are present.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'YNstLuyZfjVsvqQNHvoVZhEWkwRQadJM' is assigned a version string but is unused elsewhere, which appears extraneous but not malicious. The code does not contain hardcoded credentials or suspicious code. The import of 'black' is standard for code formatting tasks.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'black' library and defines a function that formats a given code string using black's formatting mode. The variable 'YNstLuyZfjVsvqQNHvoVZhEWkwRQadJM' seems unrelated to the main functionality, possibly a remnant or obfuscation attempt. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is detected. The function's purpose is benign and straightforward, serving as a code formatter wrapper.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, benign utility for formatting code strings with no malicious intent. The extraneous variable does not indicate malicious behavior. Overall, the code is low risk with no signs of malware.",
