      "conclusion": "The script appears to be a typical setup configuration with obfuscation in import statements and variable names. The obfuscated import is suspicious and warrants further investigation into the actual module 'gLaIgupnRLxhCtOmpVspuobESUyBsjzX'. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation increases the risk profile. Proceed with caution and verify the imported module's integrity."
