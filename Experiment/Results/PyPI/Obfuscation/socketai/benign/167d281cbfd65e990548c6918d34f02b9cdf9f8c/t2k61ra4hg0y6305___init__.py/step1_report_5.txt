{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define variables related to generating or referencing codenames and includes metadata such as version and description.",
  "sources": "None explicitly reading external input or data; all variables are assigned static string values.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; variables are assigned static values with no further processing or output.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names of imported functions are obfuscated or auto-generated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. The code lacks executable logic or data manipulation beyond variable assignment.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions with seemingly random or obfuscated names from a module named 'codenamize' but does not invoke them. Variables are assigned static strings, including metadata like description and version. There are no signs of data processing, external communication, or sensitive information handling. The import and variable assignments are benign and typical for configuration or metadata setup. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "This code is simple variable assignment with an import statement. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated function names are not inherently suspicious, as they could be part of a package that employs code obfuscation for legitimate reasons. Overall, the code appears safe and non-malicious.",
