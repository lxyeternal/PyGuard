{
  "purpose": "The code appears to import specific functions or variables from a local module named 'codenamize' and define some string variables, likely related to naming or versioning.",
  "sources": "The source of data is the local module '.codenamize' from which functions or variables are imported.",
  "sinks": "The code assigns string literals to variables, which do not pose immediate risks. No data is being sent or used in a way that affects external systems.",
  "flows": "The imported functions or variables are not invoked or used further in this fragment; the string variables are set but not used in any data flow that leads to external actions.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious imports, or unusual code structures are present. The imported identifiers are obfuscated, but this alone is not malicious. The variable 'vwnVzjgMuRVzWvuyqzOWkKFqaUHyIRLV' appears to be a label or metadata.",
  "analysis": "The code imports obfuscated function or variable names from a local module, then assigns descriptive strings to variables. There is no dynamic execution, data transmission, or suspicious activity observed. The code is minimal and appears benign, possibly part of a larger module focused on naming conventions or versioning. No evidence of malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are present in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, involving imports and variable assignments related to naming or versioning. There are no indications of malicious intent, supply chain attack, or security risks in this snippet.",
