  "flows": [
    "Importing functions from a local module (potentially malicious or benign depending on context).",
    "Assigning static string values to variables."
  ],
  "anomalies": [
    "Use of highly obfuscated function and variable names without context.",
    "No actual function calls or data processing beyond static assignments.",
    "No indication of malicious activity, such as network access or data exfiltration.",
    "The imported functions are not invoked."
  ],
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions from a local module 'codenamize' using obfuscated names. It then assigns three static string constants to variables with similarly obfuscated names. There are no function calls, data processing, or interactions with external systems. The import and variable assignments alone do not indicate malicious intent. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but without further code or context, it appears benign. No clear malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears to be benign, consisting solely of importing functions and defining static strings with obfuscated names. No malicious activity or security risks are detected based on the provided snippet.",
