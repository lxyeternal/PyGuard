{
  "purpose": "Import obfuscated functions from a local module and define static variables related to codenames and author info.",
  "sources": "Static variable assignments; import statements for functions with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input/output, no external communication or data processing.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static imports and variable definitions without invocation or external data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; no function calls or external interactions; static data only.",
  "analysis": "The code imports three functions with obfuscated names, assigns static strings including a person's name, description, and version. There are no function calls, data processing, or external communication. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The code appears benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscated identifiers are moderate and justified by the context, with no active malicious activity present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, involving static imports and variable definitions with obfuscated names. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The obfuscation is likely for concealment or stylistic purposes rather than malicious intent.",
