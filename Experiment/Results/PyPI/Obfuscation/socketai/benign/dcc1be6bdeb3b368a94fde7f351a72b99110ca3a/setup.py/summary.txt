  "conclusion": "The script is a typical build and upload setup with some unsafe command execution practices but no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The main concern is the use of os.system() without validation, which should be replaced with safer subprocess calls. The random strings and variable names are noise rather than malicious obfuscation. Overall, the code is benign but should be reviewed for safer command execution."
