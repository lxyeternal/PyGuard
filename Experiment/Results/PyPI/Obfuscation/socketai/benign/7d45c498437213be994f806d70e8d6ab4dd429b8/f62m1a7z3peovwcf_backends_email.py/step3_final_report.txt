  "purpose": "An obfuscated Python class designed to send emails via Django's send_mail, loading configuration from external modules.",
  "sources": "Input parameters 'email_address' and 'DtuvqOQeZmpUigYnbtVvDMtOgpcazuid' passed directly to send_mail without validation; external configuration loaded via obfuscated function.",
  "sinks": "send_mail function with unvalidated email content, potential for email injection or spoofing if inputs are malicious.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow directly into send_mail as email body after encoding; no sanitization or validation performed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated module and variable names; direct use of untrusted input in email content; external configuration loaded via obfuscated function.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an email backend class that loads configuration from an obfuscated source. It sends emails by passing user input directly into send_mail after encoding, without sanitization. Obfuscated names suggest concealment, but no explicit malicious payloads are present. The main security concern is potential email injection due to lack of input validation. The obfuscation and external dependencies increase the risk profile but do not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard email backend with obfuscation and potential input handling issues. No direct malware is evident, but obfuscation and unvalidated inputs warrant cautious review. The malware score is low, but the obfuscation and input handling suggest moderate risk.",
