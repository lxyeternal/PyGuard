{
  "purpose": "The code appears to extract the version number from the __init__.py file of the django_notifications package and then sets up the package for distribution using distutils.",
  "sources": "The code reads the content of __init__.py in the django_notifications directory, specifically searching for the __version__ variable.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write or execute untrusted data; it only reads a version string and calls setup() with static parameters.",
  "flows": "The version string extracted via regex is evaluated with eval(), then used as a parameter in setup().",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on a regex-matched string from a file introduces potential security risks if the file contents are manipulated maliciously. The code opens and reads a potentially untrusted __init__.py file without validation.",
  "analysis": "The script imports os and re modules, compiles a regex to find __version__ in __init__.py, and opens __init__.py for reading. It searches line-by-line for the version declaration. If found, it evaluates the captured string with eval() — a risky operation if the file contents are compromised. The code then closes the file and proceeds to call setup() with static and hardcoded parameters. No network or system modifications occur, and no user input is processed. The eval() usage is the main concern, as it could execute malicious code if the __init__.py file is tampered with.\n\nOverall, the code's main security concern is the eval() on external data, which can lead to code execution if the __init__.py file is maliciously altered. There are no other suspicious behaviors or indicators of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The script's primary security risk is the unsafe use of eval() on the version string extracted from __init__.py. If an attacker can modify that file, they could execute arbitrary code during setup. Aside from that, the code is straightforward and does not perform malicious actions. Its overall malware risk is low but the eval() usage warrants caution.",
