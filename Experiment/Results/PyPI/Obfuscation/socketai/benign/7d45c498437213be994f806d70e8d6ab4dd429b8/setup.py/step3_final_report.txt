  "purpose": "Extracts the __version__ variable from __init__.py using regex, evaluates it with eval(), and uses it in setup() for package configuration.",

  "sinks": "eval() on the extracted version string, used in setup() call.",
  "flows": "Read file -> regex search -> eval() -> use in setup()",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval() on data from an external file, which could be malicious if the file is tampered with.",
  "analysis": "The code reads __init__.py, searches for __version__ assignment, extracts the version string, and evaluates it with eval(). The main security concern is the use of eval() on external data, which could execute arbitrary code if __init__.py is maliciously modified. No malicious payloads or obfuscation are present. The code is straightforward and standard for package setup. The risk stems from potential exploitation if the version string is manipulated. Malware score is 0, as no malicious activity is detected. Obfuscated score is 0, code is clear. The security risk score should be around 0.6 due to the unsafe eval() usage, which could lead to code execution if the source is compromised.",
  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the unsafe use of eval() on external data, which could allow arbitrary code execution if __init__.py is maliciously altered. No malware or obfuscation is evident. The overall risk score should be approximately 0.6, reflecting a moderate vulnerability that warrants refactoring to safer parsing methods.",
