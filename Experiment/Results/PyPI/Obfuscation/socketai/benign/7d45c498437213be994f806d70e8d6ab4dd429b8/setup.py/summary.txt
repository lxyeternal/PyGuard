  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the unsafe use of eval() on external data, which could allow arbitrary code execution if __init__.py is maliciously altered. No malware or obfuscation is evident. The overall risk score should be approximately 0.6, reflecting a moderate vulnerability that warrants refactoring to safer parsing methods."
