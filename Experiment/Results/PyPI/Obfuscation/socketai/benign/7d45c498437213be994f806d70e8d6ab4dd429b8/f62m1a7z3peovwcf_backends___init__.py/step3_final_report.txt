  "purpose": "Manage notification backends via dynamic module imports and attribute access, based on configuration data.",
  "sources": "Configuration dictionary entries, sys.modules, and string manipulations to derive module and class names.",
  "sinks": "Dynamic __import__ calls, getattr attribute access, and sys.modules lookups that can execute arbitrary code if data is maliciously crafted.",
  "flows": "Configuration data influences module names; these are imported via __import__, then attributes are accessed via getattr, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, use of string slicing to derive module/class names, undefined variables like 'module_name', minimal validation, and reliance on dynamic import without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code heavily relies on dynamic module import (__import__) and attribute access (getattr) based on configuration data, with obfuscated naming patterns. The use of string slicing to construct module/class names and the absence of validation or sanitization mechanisms pose significant security risks. The code's structure suggests potential obfuscation or malicious intent, especially given the incomplete or placeholder variables like 'module_name'. The reliance on sys.modules to access modules further increases the risk if module names are manipulated. No explicit malicious payloads are present, but the pattern of dynamic, unvalidated code execution is a common vector for supply chain attacks or malicious sabotage.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and uses dynamic import and attribute access mechanisms that could be exploited to execute malicious modules if inputs are untrusted. While no explicit malicious payloads are identified, the structural risks warrant caution. The scores assigned in the reports—malware around 0.5-0.6, obfuscation around 0.7-0.8, and security risk around 0.7—are justified given the potential for malicious code execution through these patterns.",
