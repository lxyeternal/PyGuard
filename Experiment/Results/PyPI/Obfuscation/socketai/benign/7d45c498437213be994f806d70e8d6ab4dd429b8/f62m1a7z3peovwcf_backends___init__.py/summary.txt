  "obfuscated": 0.8,
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and uses dynamic import and attribute access mechanisms that could be exploited to execute malicious modules if inputs are untrusted. While no explicit malicious payloads are identified, the structural risks warrant caution. The scores assigned in the reports—malware around 0.5-0.6, obfuscation around 0.7-0.8, and security risk around 0.7—are justified given the potential for malicious code execution through these patterns."
