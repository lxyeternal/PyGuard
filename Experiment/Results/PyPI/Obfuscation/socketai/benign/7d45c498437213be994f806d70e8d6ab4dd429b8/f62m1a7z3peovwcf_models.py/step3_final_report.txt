  "purpose": "Defines Django models for notification subscriptions, signal handlers, and utility functions to trigger background tasks based on model events.",
  "sources": "Model instance attributes, signal handlers (post_save, post_delete), dynamic attribute access via __dict__, docstring parsing for command extraction.",
  "sinks": "Background task invocation via delay(), indirect command execution through reflection and string parsing.",
  "flows": "Model instance data -> signal handlers -> utility functions -> background tasks (delay())",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, use of deprecated 'iteritems()', dynamic attribute access, command extraction from __doc__, indirect invocation of tasks, unused import from 'backends'.",
  "analysis": "The code manages notification models with signal handlers that trigger background tasks. Obfuscated naming and dynamic attribute access obscure intent but do not explicitly indicate malicious activity. The use of indirect invocation and command parsing could hide malicious behavior if the background tasks or commands are malicious. The obfuscation level is high, and outdated syntax suggests code is either legacy or intentionally obscured. No evidence of data exfiltration, network calls, or system damage is present in the snippet. The scores assigned in the reports reflect the obfuscation and indirect invocation, with higher suspicion in the heavily obfuscated sections. Overall, the code appears as a notification management system with potential for malicious use if the background tasks are malicious, but no direct malicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and employs indirect invocation patterns that could be exploited maliciously. However, there is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or activities within this snippet. The high obfuscation and dynamic command extraction warrant caution, but the overall malicious intent cannot be confirmed without further context on the background tasks. The assigned malware score (~0.2–0.4), obfuscation (~0.7), and moderate risk (~0.3–0.5) are justified based on the observed patterns.",
