  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and contains logic that could be exploited to disable or hide data, raising moderate security concerns. No direct evidence of malware or malicious payloads is present. The primary risks stem from obfuscation and the toggle mechanism, which should be reviewed further. Overall, the code warrants cautious review but does not currently pose an active threat."
