  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, if obfuscated, notification client. While no malicious activity is demonstrated, the obfuscation and silent import failures are suspicious and merit further review of external dependencies and deployment environment. The malware score is set low due to the absence of malicious payloads, but the obfuscation justifies a moderate security risk score."
