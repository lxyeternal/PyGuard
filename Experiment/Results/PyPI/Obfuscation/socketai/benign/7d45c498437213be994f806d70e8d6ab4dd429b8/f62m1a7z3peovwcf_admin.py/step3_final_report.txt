  "purpose": "Assessment of Django admin code with obfuscated identifiers, evaluating for malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "sources": "ContentType model lookups, ORM methods, class and variable definitions, data retrieval functions.",
  "sinks": "ContentType retrieval, object representations, count functions, related object filters.",
  "flows": "From ContentType queries to object fetches and related object counts, with no external network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, but no malicious code, external calls, or data leaks detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard Django admin setup with obfuscated identifiers, utilizing ContentType for dynamic object retrieval and ORM for related data counts. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code patterns are present. Obfuscation appears to be for concealment rather than malicious intent. The functions perform typical data retrieval and display tasks without security issues. Scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, risk: very low, obfuscation: high) are consistent with the code's behavior and structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical Django admin configuration with obfuscation. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score remains at zero. Overall, the code appears benign, and the reports' assessments are accurate.",
