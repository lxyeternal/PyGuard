  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated testing harness that orchestrates external script execution without embedded malicious payloads. The primary security concern is the trustworthiness of external scripts, not the code itself. Malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (~0.6), and overall security risk is low (~0.3)."
