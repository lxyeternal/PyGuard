{
  "purpose": "Run all tests from the 'test.all_tests' module and exit with a status code indicating success or failure.",
  "sources": "Imports 'sys', 'test.all_tests', and 'unittest'. Uses function calls to 'test.all_tests.LeowMjyDaWKfTKDsXzYaSrUhmngYjbQc()'.",
  "sinks": "Calls 'unittest.TextTestRunner().djSjsPkdASAlPRJTShRzFqunlpUDeVxD()' with test suite; exits with sys.exit().",
  "flows": "Imports data from 'test.all_tests.LeowMjyDaWKfTKDsXzYaSrUhmngYjbQc()', passes it to 'TextTestRunner', then exits with status.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function names and method names such as 'djSjsPkdASAlPRJTShRzFqunlpUDeVxD'. These could be attempts to hide intent. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious strings detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and a test module. It defines a function with a non-descriptive name that calls a similarly obfuscated method from 'test.all_tests'. It then runs the tests using 'unittest.TextTestRunner', with an obfuscated method 'djSjsPkdASAlPRJTShRzFqunlpUDeVxD'. Based on the structure, it appears to run tests and exit accordingly. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide the test execution logic but does not indicate malicious activity. No external network activity, no data exfiltration, no credential handling, and no system manipulation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard test runner with obfuscated method names. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware is present. The obfuscation might be an attempt to conceal code intent, but functionality remains benign.",
