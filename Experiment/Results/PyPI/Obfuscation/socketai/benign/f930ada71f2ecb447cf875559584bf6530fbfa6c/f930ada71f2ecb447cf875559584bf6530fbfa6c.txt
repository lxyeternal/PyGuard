      "conclusion": "The script is a benign web automation tool with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The current scores are justified but could be slightly adjusted to reflect the absence of malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code is benign import statements with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The current malware score of 0.1 and security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate, reflecting low likelihood of malicious behavior but acknowledging the obfuscation. Further review of the imported modules' contents is recommended to confirm their benign nature."

      "obfuscated": 0.6,
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward web scraper with heavily obfuscated variable names but no signs of malicious behavior or malware. The security risk is low, primarily related to URL manipulation potential, which is typical in scraping scripts. The malware score is 0, and the obfuscation is moderate. Overall, the code is safe for use with standard precautions."
