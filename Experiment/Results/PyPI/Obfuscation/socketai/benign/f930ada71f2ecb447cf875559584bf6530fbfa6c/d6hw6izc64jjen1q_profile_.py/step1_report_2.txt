  "purpose": "Retrieve and parse club profile information from a specific URL using club ID.",
  "sources": "User-provided 'club_id' input, URL construction, HTTP GET request to the URL, HTML content parsing.",
  "sinks": "None identified for untrusted data leading to data leak or harmful actions.",
  "flows": "club_id -> URL construction -> HTTP request -> response content -> BeautifulSoup parsing -> data extraction.",
  "anomalies": "The URL is constructed dynamically, but there's no evident malicious logic such as code injection or data exfiltration. The code handles errors properly. No hardcoded credentials or secrets detected.",
  "analysis": "The code retrieves club profile data by constructing a URL with a provided club ID, performs an HTTP GET request, and parses the HTML content for specific information. It employs standard libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup) with appropriate error handling. The functions parse HTML tags safely and raise exceptions when expected elements are missing or incorrectly typed. No obfuscated or suspicious code features are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data theft, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The structure and logic appear standard for web scraping tasks.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a typical web scraper designed to fetch and parse specific data from a public website. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. The code is well-structured, with proper error handling, and does not contain obfuscated or malicious code segments.",
