  "conclusion": "The script is a benign web automation tool with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The current scores are justified but could be slightly adjusted to reflect the absence of malicious intent."
