  "purpose": "Import specific classes and variables from 'britishcycling_clubs.manager' and 'britishcycling_clubs.profile_' modules, and define exportable symbols.",
  "sources": "Import statements from two modules with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "None; code only performs imports and defines __all__.",
  "flows": "No data flow; purely import and export declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of nonsensical, obfuscated variable names for imported identifiers.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with obfuscated names, indicating possible concealment or auto-generation. No logic, data processing, or external communication is present. The high obfuscation score (0.9) is justified given the nonsensical identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution is observed. The import pattern is typical for modules that may be intentionally obfuscated or auto-generated, but without further context, these do not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign import statements with obfuscated identifiers. While obfuscation raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious intent or activity. The current malware score of 0.1 and security risk score of 0.2 are appropriate, reflecting low likelihood of malicious behavior but acknowledging the obfuscation. Further review of the imported modules' contents is recommended to confirm their benign nature.",
