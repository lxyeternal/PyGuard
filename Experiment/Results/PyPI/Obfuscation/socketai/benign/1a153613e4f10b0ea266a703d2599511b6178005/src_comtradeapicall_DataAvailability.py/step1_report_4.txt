  "purpose": "The code provides functions to interact with a public API for trade data, fetching various datasets based on parameters, and handling API requests with optional proxy support.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to functions, including subscription keys, data types, codes, dates, and optional proxy URLs; data received from API responses.",
  "sinks": "API request execution via urllib3 request method; potential data processing via json.loads and pandas.json_normalize; printing of error messages.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction and request setup -> API request -> response processing -> data normalization or error printing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs and parameters; no explicit hardcoded credentials, but functions generate dynamic request URLs; proxy parameter may indicate network interception, but not malicious alone; no suspicious or obfuscated code found.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs API request URLs based on input parameters, with some functions setting default parameters or calling others. It performs network requests using urllib3, with optional proxy support. The response handling checks status codes and decodes JSON data, normalizing it for return. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious network activities are evident. Proxy usage could be for legitimate network configuration or monitoring. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns are present. The purpose appears to be data retrieval from a public API, with proper error handling. There are no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for legitimate data retrieval purposes from a public API. It does not contain malicious or suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or backdoors. Proxy parameter may be used for network configuration but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code appears safe and purpose-driven.",
