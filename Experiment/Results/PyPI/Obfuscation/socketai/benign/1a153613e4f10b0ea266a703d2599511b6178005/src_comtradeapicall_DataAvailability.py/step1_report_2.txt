{
  "purpose": "This code provides functions to interact with the UN Comtrade API for data retrieval, including specific endpoints for different data types and formats.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters such as subscription keys, data types, codes, and date parameters; makes HTTP requests via urllib3 to external URLs.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request functions that send constructed URLs and parameters to external servers; data returned is parsed and normalized.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction based on parameters -> HTTP GET request -> Response handling and JSON parsing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of hardcoded URLs; no validation or sanitization of input parameters; the functions mainly assemble URLs and make requests without internal validation.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs URLs dynamically for API endpoints based on input parameters, including conditional URL segments for different data types and formats. It employs urllib3 for HTTP requests, with optional proxy support, and handles responses by checking status codes and parsing JSON data. There is no evidence of hardcoded credentials beyond the subscription key parameter, nor any hidden code or obfuscation. The functions primarily serve as wrappers around API calls, with no suspicious or malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The use of exception handling for request errors is standard. The code's purpose is legitimate API interaction; no malicious intent is apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of API wrapper functions designed for data retrieval from the UN Comtrade API. It does not contain malicious behavior, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code. The URL and request handling are standard, with no signs of malicious activity or sabotage.",
