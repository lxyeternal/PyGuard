The primary concern is the obfuscation and flexible network configuration, which could be exploited if endpoints or proxies are maliciously controlled. Overall, the code's behavior is consistent with a data collection tool with moderate risk due to obfuscation and network activity."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation but no direct malicious activity. The suspicion is justified due to the obfuscated identifiers, but without further analysis of the imported modules, malicious intent cannot be confirmed. The current scores are reasonable; a malware score of approximately 0.2, obfuscation score around 0.75, and overall risk near 0.4 appropriately reflect the situation. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to determine if they contain malicious code."

The security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible. The obfuscation is superficial and not malicious. The overall security assessment is that the code is safe for use, with a low security risk score."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API data retrieval function with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security concern is the use of print statements for data and error output, which could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."

However, obfuscation and lack of input validation could be exploited if inputs are malicious. The overall security risk is moderate, and the code should be reviewed carefully before deployment in sensitive environments."
