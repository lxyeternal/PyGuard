{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for retrieving trade or tariff data from an external API, processing JSON responses, and consolidating data into pandas DataFrames.",
  "sources": "Data sources include user inputs for subscription keys, data type parameters, and URLs constructed based on parameters; input data is primarily from function arguments and external API responses.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include printing error messages, making HTTP requests via urllib3, and returning pandas DataFrames. No direct data leaks or malicious data exfiltration is evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments into URL construction and request payloads, then from API responses into JSON parsing and DataFrame creation, with error handling involving request retries and sleeps.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials or secrets; it performs repeated API requests with retries and sleep, which is typical for robustness, not malicious. No obfuscation or misleading code structure is present. The variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API request operations, including URL construction based on input parameters, request execution with error handling, JSON parsing, and DataFrame creation. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors. The functions seem to be part of a data retrieval pipeline, with retries for reliability. No suspicious network activity, code injection, or credential theft observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical API data retrieval module for trade data, with standard error handling and data processing. There is no evidence of malicious intent, backdoors, or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate data access layer with normal operational logic.",
