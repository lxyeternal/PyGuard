  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code, the logic, and the scores assigned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Describes standard API data retrieval; sources are function arguments and responses.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** No data leaks or malicious exfiltration; data flows from API to pandas DataFrame.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscation, no malicious behavior. Variable names are obfuscated but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate data retrieval code, no malicious activity.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, given the nature of the code)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- Similar to Report 1, emphasizing API data fetching, JSON parsing, and DataFrame creation.\n- No signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.\n- Retry logic with sleep is standard for robustness.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (appropriate)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- Focuses on the same pattern: API requests, JSON parsing, retries.\n- No malicious behavior or obfuscation.\n- Use of pandas and urllib3 is legitimate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- Similar to previous reports, describing API wrapper functions for trade data.\n- No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation.\n- Retry logic and URL construction are standard.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- Same overall pattern: API requests, JSON responses, data processing.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation.\n- Retry logic with sleep is typical.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0  \n- Obfuscated: 0  \n- Risk: 0.2\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of observations:\n\n- **Code presence of malicious activity:** None detected. The code performs legitimate API data retrieval, parsing, and DataFrame handling.\n- **Obfuscation:** Variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent; they are likely for code brevity or obfuscation, not malicious purposes.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (0.2), which aligns with the code's functionality and the reports' conclusions.\n- **Malware scores:** All are 0, which is justified given the lack of malicious behavior.\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent with the reports.\n- No higher scores are warranted unless new evidence of malicious activity emerges.\n- The high confidence levels (0.9) are justified given the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0** (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0** (variable names are obfuscated but not malicious)  \n**Estimated risk score:** **0.2** (low, typical for API wrappers)\n\nThe current scores are appropriate; no adjustments are necessary.",
