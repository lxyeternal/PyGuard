{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to fetch tariff and trade data from a remote API, process it, and handle retries on failure.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as subscription_key, tradeDataType, typeCode, freqCode, clCode, and various other parameters; environmental data is not explicitly read.",
  "sinks": "Data fetched from the API; potential for untrusted data processing, but no sensitive data leaks or insecure data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Inputs like subscription keys and parameters are used to construct API requests; data flows from API responses through JSON parsing and pandas dataframes, with no evident untrusted data affecting system behavior beyond data processing.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains extensive use of dynamic string concatenation for URL construction and API request handling, but no obfuscated or suspicious code structures. Retry logic with sleep delays is standard for API calls.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple functions that generate API URLs based on input parameters and fetch data from a remote server using urllib3. Data fetched is parsed from JSON and converted into pandas dataframes. Retry logic is implemented on exceptions with a sleep delay. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are detected. The code does not perform any harmful actions such as system modification, data exfiltration, or network malicious activity. Usage of external libraries pandas and urllib3 is legitimate. There are no signs of obfuscation, malware payloads, or malicious behavior.\n\nOverall, the script appears to be an API client for trade data with retry handling; no malicious or sabotage code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a data-fetching client with retry logic, constructed URL requests, and data processing. There is no evidence of malicious intent, sabotage, or malware. The logic is consistent with a data retrieval utility, with no suspicious or harmful behavior detected.",
