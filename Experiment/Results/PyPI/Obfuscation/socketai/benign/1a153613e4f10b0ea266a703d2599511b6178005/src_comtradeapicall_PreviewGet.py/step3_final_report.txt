{
  "purpose": "The code provides a set of functions to construct API request URLs, perform HTTP GET requests to the UN Comtrade API, parse JSON responses, and return the data as pandas DataFrames. It is designed for retrieving trade data, with retry logic for network robustness.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for API URL construction, external API responses, and JSON data returned from the API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "The data flows from API responses into JSON parsing and pandas DataFrames; no data leaks or exfiltration are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL construction -> API request -> JSON response -> parsing -> pandas DataFrame output.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets; variable names are obfuscated but do not indicate malicious intent; use of broad exception handling masks specific errors; no suspicious code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard API client for trade data retrieval, with functions for URL building, request handling, JSON parsing, and data normalization. No malicious payloads, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Error handling with retries is typical. Variable obfuscation does not imply malicious intent. The network activity targets legitimate endpoints. The overall structure and behavior are consistent with benign data access code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, well-structured API client with no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The current malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk score (~0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
