  "purpose": "Function to fetch data from an external API endpoint with configurable parameters and return normalized JSON data.",
  "sources": "Subscription key parameter, URL construction with parameters, environment variables for proxy configuration, request data from external API.",
  "sinks": "HTTP request execution, JSON parsing, print statements for error reporting.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (including subscription key and optional proxy) used to build request headers and URL → HTTP request → response handling → JSON normalization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for error reporting, dynamic URL construction, optional proxy configuration, no explicit validation of subscription key or other sensitive parameters, no validation or sanitization of inputs. No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL and request parameters dynamically, then performs an HTTP GET request using urllib3, optionally via a proxy. It includes a subscription key in headers. Error handling captures request errors and logs them with print. The function processes the response data as JSON and normalizes it for return. There are no signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The print statements are used for debugging or error reporting but do not appear malicious. No hardcoded credentials besides the subscription key parameter are present. The code interacts only with the specified API endpoint and performs standard data fetching.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard API client function with no evident malicious intent. It performs typical operations: constructing a request, optionally using a proxy, handling responses, and returning normalized data. No malicious behavior or sabotage detected.",
