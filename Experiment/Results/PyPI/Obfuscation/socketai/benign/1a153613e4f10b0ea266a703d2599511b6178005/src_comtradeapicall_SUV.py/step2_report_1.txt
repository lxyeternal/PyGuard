  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and evaluate the code and their assessments.\n\n**1. Presence of Malicious or Malicious-Like Behavior:**\n\n- The code constructs URLs dynamically based on parameters, includes a subscription key, optionally uses proxies, and processes JSON responses.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets besides the subscription key parameter.\n- No obfuscated code, code injection, or suspicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system sabotage are evident.\n- The code's purpose is to fetch and normalize data from an external API, which is a common pattern.\n\n**2. Potential Security Concerns:**\n\n- Use of environment variables for proxies and dynamic URL construction are standard practices, though they can be misused if inputs are malicious.\n- The print statements for errors and data could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed, but this is not malicious per se.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious code execution.\n\n**3. Scores Evaluation:**\n\n- All reports assign malware scores of 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- Obfuscated scores are low (mostly 0 or 0.2), reflecting minimal obfuscation.\n- Security risk scores are low (~0.2), considering the potential for data leakage via logs but not malicious activity.\n- Confidence levels are high (0.9), indicating the reviewers agree on the benign nature.\n\n**4. Logical Flaws or Mistakes in Reports:**\n\n- The reports correctly identify the code as standard API client code with no malicious intent.\n- They note potential issues like data leakage via print statements but do not consider this malicious.\n- No false positives or overestimations are evident.\n\n**5. Recommendations:**\n\n- The overall assessments are reasonable.\n- The only adjustment I might suggest is to explicitly note that the print statements, while not malicious, should be replaced with proper logging with access controls to prevent accidental data leaks.\n\n---\n\n### Final Justification and Personal Estimate:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No malicious code or behavior detected.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation evident.\n\n**Risk Score:** 0.2 — Slightly elevated due to logging practices, but not a security risk in itself.\n\n**Overall Conclusion:**\n\nThe code is a standard, well-structured API client function with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The reports correctly identify this, and their scores are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type      | Final Estimate |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Malware         | 0              |\n| Obfuscated      | 0              |\n| Security Risk | 0.2            |\n\nThe code appears safe, with minor considerations for logging practices but no malicious intent.",
