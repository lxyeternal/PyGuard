  "purpose": "This function constructs and sends an HTTP GET request to an external API endpoint, retrieves JSON data, and normalizes it for further processing.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: subscription_key, typeCode, freqCode, clCode, aHvJHnQupAdWNpnqXrHGkIUNuSkvjTUr, pTdFGpLOuWMgHSNgdCPwqXcqqYBqZZQu, IRspPZFtTmvXndyQjkbRAeKXripkmGIX, qtyUnitCode, eLIYENNMEdAjNyWpLLaIOoJREkbblGXN; Environment variables potentially used for proxies.",
  "sinks": "Network request via urllib3 (GET request); potential data exfiltration if malicious code modifies data or endpoint.",
  "flows": "Input parameters -> URL and request data construction -> HTTP request -> Response handling -> JSON parsing and normalization.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic URL construction with user-controlled parameters; inclusion of optional proxy configuration; printing of error and response data directly, which could leak information if output is exposed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL using provided parameters, adds a subscription key, and filters out None values before making a network request. It supports optional proxy configuration. The request is wrapped in a try-except block handling urllib3.RequestError. On successful response, it parses JSON data and normalizes nested data. No hardcoded secrets beyond the subscription key are present. Proxy configuration and request handling appear standard. The print statements for errors and data could leak sensitive info if the output is exposed externally. The code does not include any obfuscation, backdoors, or suspicious logic. Overall, the code performs typical API data retrieval without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard API request function that safely constructs and sends a request, processes the response, and normalizes JSON data. No malicious or suspicious behavior was detected. Use of print statements for error and data logging could potentially expose sensitive information but does not constitute malicious activity.",
