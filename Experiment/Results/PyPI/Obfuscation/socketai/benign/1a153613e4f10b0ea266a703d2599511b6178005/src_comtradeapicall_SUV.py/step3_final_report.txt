{
  "purpose": "Fetches data from an external API endpoint constructed dynamically based on input parameters, processes the JSON response, and normalizes it into a pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for URL construction, subscription key, optional proxy configuration, and response data from the HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "Print statements outputting data and errors; JSON response data processed and returned; potential data leakage via logs.",
  "flows": "Parameters used to build URL and headers (source); request sent via urllib3 (sink); response data parsed and normalized (sink).",
  "anomalies": "Use of print statements for error and data output, obscure variable names, dynamic URL and proxy configuration, but no hardcoded secrets or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL based on parameters, adds a subscription key, optionally uses a proxy, performs an HTTP GET request, handles errors, and processes JSON data. No signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or backdoors are present. The print statements could leak sensitive info but are typical for debugging. Proxy usage is standard. Variable naming is obscure but not malicious. Overall, the code functions as a standard API client with no malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API data retrieval function with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security concern is the use of print statements for data and error output, which could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
