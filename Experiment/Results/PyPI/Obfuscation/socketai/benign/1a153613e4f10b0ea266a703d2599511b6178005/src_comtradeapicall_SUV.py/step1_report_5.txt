{
  "purpose": "The function constructs a URL and makes an HTTP GET request to an external API, processing the JSON response into a normalized pandas DataFrame.",
  "sources": "Reads input parameters (subscription_key, typeCode, freqCode, clCode, and optional parameters), environment variables for proxy settings, and the response data from the HTTP request.",
  "sinks": "Potentially outputs or processes the HTTP response data. No direct data leaks or untrusted data sinks are apparent beyond the API request.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to build the URL and request headers; the request is sent; response data is processed into JSON and normalized.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual use of dynamic URL construction; no hardcoded credentials besides 'subscription_key' which is passed as argument; the response handling includes a print statement for errors but no evident malicious payloads or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code dynamically constructs a URL for an API endpoint, includes a subscription key in headers, and uses optional proxy settings for the request. It performs an HTTP GET request and processes JSON data into a pandas DataFrame. There are no signs of obfuscation, code injection, or malicious data exfiltration. The code does handle request errors by printing, but this is standard error handling. No hidden backdoors or suspicious behaviors are evident. Proxy usage is configurable, which could be misused if controlled externally, but alone does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate API request and data processing function with no clear malicious behavior or security risks. It responsibly handles errors and uses standard libraries. No indicators of malware or malicious intent are present.",
