  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API data retrieval function with no evidence of malicious activity or obfuscation. The minor security concern is the use of print statements for data and error output, which could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed. The scores of malware=0, obfuscated=0.2, and securityRisk=0.2 are appropriate and consistent with the analysis."
