  "review": "Let's analyze the reports step-by-step and compare them with the provided code.\n\n**Code Summary:**\n- The function constructs a URL based on parameters.\n- Adds a subscription key to request headers.\n- Supports optional proxy configuration.\n- Performs an HTTP GET request with a 120s timeout.\n- Checks response status; logs data if not 200.\n- Parses JSON response and normalizes data.\n- Handles RequestError exceptions.\n- Uses print statements for errors and response data.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations and Discrepancies:\n\n**Presence of Issues in Code:**\n- No hardcoded credentials beyond the subscription key (passed as parameter).\n- No obfuscated code; variable names are obscure but consistent.\n- No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration.\n- Uses standard libraries and practices for API requests.\n- Error handling is basic; print statements are present but not malicious.\n- Proxy configuration is optional and standard.\n\n**Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in Reports:**\n- All reports correctly identify the code as a standard API client.\n- They note the use of dynamic URL construction, optional proxy, and print statements.\n- No report mentions any actual malicious activity or code injection.\n- Slightly overemphasize the potential for data leakage via print statements, but this is a common concern, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### Score Justifications:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign 0, citing no malicious behavior.\n- This aligns with the code's functionality.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- Slightly varied (0.2 to 0.2), due to variable naming.\n- The code is not intentionally obfuscated but has obscure variable names, which is not malicious.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- All reports assign 0.2, citing standard data retrieval with minor concerns about print statements leaking info.\n- Given the code's nature, this seems reasonable.\n\n**Potential for Higher Scores?**\n- No, the code does not exhibit malicious intent or vulnerabilities warranting higher scores.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Analysis:\n\n- The code does not perform any malicious actions.\n- No signs of malware, obfuscation, or backdoors.\n- The only concern is the use of print statements for error reporting, which could leak sensitive info if logs are exposed, but this is not malicious.\n- Proxy configuration is standard and not suspicious.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.2 (variable names are obscure but not malicious)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 (standard API request, minor info leakage potential via print statements)\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code is a typical API client function with no signs of malware or malicious intent. The scores given in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate.\n- No adjustments needed.\n- The code is safe from a supply chain security perspective based on the provided analysis.\n\n**Note:** Always recommend removing or replacing print statements with proper logging in production to prevent info leaks.",
