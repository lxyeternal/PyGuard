  "purpose": "This function retrieves AIS data from a remote API endpoint, using specified parameters and an API key, and processes the response into a normalized JSON format.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: subscription_key, typeCode, freqCode, clCode, countryareaCode, vesselTypeCode, IRspPZFtTmvXndyQjkbRAeKXripkmGIX, dateFrom, dateTo, QZQEeCrRKjBrpexZRusDfxYKXGuXUkxG, eLIYENNMEdAjNyWpLLaIOoJREkbblGXN; Data fetched via HTTP GET request to the constructed URL.",
  "sinks": "The code sends an HTTP GET request to an external API endpoint, potentially transmitting the subscription_key and request parameters over the network.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (including subscription_key and request filters) are used to construct URL and request data; the request is sent over the network; response data is received and parsed into JSON.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials are present; URL and request parameters are dynamically constructed; use of urllib3 with optional proxy configuration; error handling only for RequestError; no obvious malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a URL for an API request using input parameters, including the subscription key, which could be sensitive. It filters out None values from request data before sending. It supports optional proxy usage, which is typical in network requests. The request is wrapped in a try-except block for network errors. The response is checked for HTTP status code 200 before parsing; otherwise, it prints the error data. The JSON response is normalized for further use. There are no signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity. The function primarily performs a data retrieval operation with standard libraries.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to perform a legitimate API data fetch and processing task without malicious intent or suspicious behavior. It does handle network requests securely, with error handling and dynamic parameters, and does not exhibit malware-like characteristics.",
