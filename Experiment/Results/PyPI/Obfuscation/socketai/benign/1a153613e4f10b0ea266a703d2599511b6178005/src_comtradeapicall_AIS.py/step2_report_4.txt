  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, the logic, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Clearly describes a function fetching data via API with an API key, processing JSON response.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data flows from input parameters to network request, then to JSON normalization.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded credentials; use of optional proxy; error handling for network issues; no malicious code detected.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report states the code performs legitimate data retrieval with no malicious intent. It emphasizes the use of standard libraries, dynamic parameters, and proper error handling.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scores are appropriate. No change needed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar API data fetch, with parameters including subscription key.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Data transmitted over network; potential data leaks if parameters are exposed.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of dynamic URL; inclusion of subscription key in request data; no hardcoded secrets.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious activity; standard API call. Proxy configuration is normal.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar purpose, obfuscated variable names but no malicious intent.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** API request with optional proxy; response normalization.\n- **Anomalies:** Obfuscated variable names impair readability but do not imply maliciousness.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Legitimate data fetch; no malicious behavior detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0.7, risk=0.2 seem reasonable.\n\n**Note:** The obfuscation score is higher here due to variable naming, which is acknowledged as impairing readability but not malicious.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** API request with parameters, response handling.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Standard request, response processing, error printing.\n- **Anomalies:** Use of print statements for errors; no input validation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Typical API request; no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** No issues. The scoring aligns with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources:** Similar API data fetch, with multiple parameters.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Network request, response processing.\n- **Anomalies:** No input validation; dynamic URL construction; use of urllib3 with optional proxy.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Straightforward data retrieval; no signs of malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 seem justified.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Observations:\n\n- **Code confirmation:** The code is a legitimate API data fetcher, with no signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscation:** Variable naming is inconsistent and sometimes obfuscated, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign malware=0, which is consistent with the analysis.\n- **Risk scores:** All are low (0.2), which seems appropriate given the code's purpose.\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- The code performs standard API data retrieval, with optional proxy support, dynamic parameters, and error handling.\n- No evidence of malware, obfuscation, or security risk beyond typical API interaction concerns.\n- The high obfuscation score in report 3 is justified due to variable naming, but not malicious.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.6 (variable names are obfuscated, but not malicious)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (standard API interaction, minimal security risk)\n\n**Summary:** The reports are consistent, and the scores are reasonable. No adjustments needed. The code appears safe and legitimate.",
