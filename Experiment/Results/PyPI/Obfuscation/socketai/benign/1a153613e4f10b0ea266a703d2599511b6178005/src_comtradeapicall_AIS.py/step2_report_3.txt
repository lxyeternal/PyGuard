  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their findings with the provided code.\n\n**General observations about the code:**\n- The function constructs a URL dynamically based on input parameters.\n- It includes a subscription key in the request, which is standard for API authentication.\n- It filters out None values before sending.\n- It supports optional proxy configuration.\n- It handles network errors with a try-except block.\n- It checks for HTTP 200 status before parsing JSON.\n- It normalizes JSON data before returning.\n- Variable names are obfuscated, but this appears to be a code style choice rather than malicious intent.\n- No hardcoded credentials or secrets are present.\n- No signs of code injection, malicious payload, or backdoors.\n\n---\n\n### Review of each report:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- Purpose: Data fetch from API, process into normalized JSON.\n- No hardcoded credentials, no malicious code.\n- Uses standard libraries.\n- **Security risk score: 0.2** — low, justified.\n- **Malware score: 0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — variable names are obfuscated but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate data retrieval, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. No issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n- Purpose: Retrieve AIS data with customizable parameters.\n- Notes potential data leaks if subscription key is exposed.\n- No hardcoded secrets.\n- Uses standard network request practices.\n- **Security risk score: 0.2** — justified.\n- **Malware score: 0** — no malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — obfuscation present but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard API fetcher, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct. No concerns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n- Purpose: Retrieve and normalize AIS data.\n- Obfuscated variable names, but no malicious intent.\n- Proxy configuration is standard.\n- No hardcoded secrets.\n- **Security risk score: 0.2** — appropriate.\n- **Malware score: 0** — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated: 0.7** — high obfuscation, but not malicious.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate data fetch, no malicious activity.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate. Obfuscation is a style issue, not malicious.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n- Purpose: Fetch AIS data, process, and return.\n- Uses print statements for error reporting.\n- No malicious code or backdoors.\n- Proxy configuration is optional.\n- **Security risk score: 0.2** — justified.\n- **Malware score: 0** — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Standard API request, no malicious intent.\n\n**Assessment:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n- Purpose: Data retrieval from external API.\n- Uses urllib3, handles response and errors.\n- No signs of malicious activity.\n- Input parameters include sensitive data, but this is typical.\n- **Security risk score: 0.2** — justified.\n- **Malware score: 0** — no malware.\n- **Obfuscated: 0** — no obfuscation.\n- **Conclusion:** Legitimate data fetch, no malicious behavior.\n\n**Assessment:** Accurate.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code correctness:** All reports agree that the code performs a legitimate API data fetch.\n- **Malware potential:** None of the reports or the code indicate malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscation:** Variable names are obfuscated, but this is not inherently malicious.\n- **Security risk:** Low, mostly due to handling of sensitive API keys and optional proxy configuration.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The **malware score** should remain at **0**, as there is no evidence of malicious activity.\n- The **obfuscated score** could be considered **0.7 to 0.8** due to variable naming, but since obfuscation alone isn't malicious, a moderate score is acceptable.\n- The **risk score** should stay at **0.2**, reflecting the low security risk.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7 (consistent with the reports)\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is a standard, legitimate API data retrieval function with no malicious intent. The obfuscation is a code style choice, not an indicator of malicious activity. The low security risk score is justified given the context.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** No changes to the scores are necessary. The analysis aligns with the reports and the code's behavior.",
