{
  "purpose": "Fetches AIS data from an external API, processes JSON response, and normalizes data into a structured format.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as subscription_key, typeCode, freqCode, clCode, dateFrom, dateTo, and optional proxy configuration.",
  "sinks": "Network request to the constructed URL with parameters; response data which is decoded and processed.",
  "flows": "Parameters are assembled into a dictionary, filtered, and sent via HTTP GET request; response data is decoded, checked, and normalized.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names impair readability; no hardcoded credentials; optional proxy support; limited error handling.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a dynamic URL based on input parameters, includes a subscription key, and makes an HTTP GET request. It filters out None values before sending. Proxy support is optional. Error handling is limited to request exceptions and response status checks. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious payloads are detected. Obfuscation is superficial and does not imply malicious intent. The code performs standard API data retrieval with proper response validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API data fetcher with no signs of malware or malicious activity. Obfuscation affects readability but not security. The overall security risk is low. Scores are consistent with the analysis, with malware=0, obfuscated=0.7 (due to variable naming), and risk=0.2.",
