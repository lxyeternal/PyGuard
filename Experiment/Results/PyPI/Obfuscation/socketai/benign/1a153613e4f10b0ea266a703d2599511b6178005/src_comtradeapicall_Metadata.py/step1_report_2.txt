{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the UN COMTRADE API to retrieve metadata, reference data, and country area codes, primarily for data analysis or processing tasks related to international trade data.",
  "sources": "Inputs include subscription keys, type codes, category names, country ISO codes, and optional proxy configurations; data is fetched via HTTP GET requests from external URLs and API endpoints.",
  "sinks": "Data flows include fetching JSON responses from external APIs, decoding JSON data, normalizing JSON into pandas DataFrames, and processing or returning filtered data sets.",
  "flows": "Inputs (API keys, category, country codes) → HTTP requests to external URLs → JSON response parsing → Data normalization and filtering → Return of processed data",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded URLs for external API endpoints, uses variable names that are not meaningful, and employs broad exception handling without specific error processing. Proxy usage is optional but not inherently suspicious. No hardcoded credentials are visible. No obfuscated code features are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API interactions using urllib3 and pandas for data normalization and filtering. It does not execute any code from external sources, nor does it write or transmit data covertly. Proxy management is conditional, likely for network configurations, not malicious purposes. No signs of backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The overall structure and variable naming suggest obfuscation is not present. No suspicious behavior or malware indicators are detected based on the provided code.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data retrieval and processing script for trade-related datasets, with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. It uses standard techniques for API communication and data handling, with no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior.",
