{
  "purpose": "The code interacts with the UN Comtrade API to fetch metadata, reference data, and country information, likely for data analysis or reporting purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as subscription_key, category, countryIsoCode, and showHistory; API responses from specified URLs.",
  "sinks": "Data returned from API requests, especially JSON data processed and normalized; no apparent untrusted data sinks or exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used to construct URLs and request data; responses are parsed, normalized, and returned; no data is sent elsewhere or stored remotely beyond the request.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic URL construction; no hardcoded credentials beyond optional proxy settings; the code handles exceptions, but no obvious malicious behavior or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily fetches JSON data from publicly available APIs or reference files, processes the data using pandas and json normalization, and returns the processed data. Proxy settings are configurable, which is standard. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious network behaviors are evident. No obfuscation or complex malicious constructs are found. The code appears to perform legitimate data retrieval and processing functions without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a standard data-fetching utility interfacing with public APIs for reference and metadata data. It does not contain any malware or malicious behavior, nor does it pose security risks. The code is straightforward, with no signs of sabotage or unauthorized data exfiltration.",
