{
  "purpose": "The code retrieves metadata, reference lists, and country information from the UN COMTRADE API, processing and normalizing the data for further use.",
  "sources": "HTTP GET requests to external URLs, reading JSON responses, and environment variables for proxy settings.",
  "sinks": "JSON data parsed into pandas DataFrames; no untrusted input directly affects system state or writes to sensitive locations.",
  "flows": "Data flows from API responses through JSON parsing and normalization into DataFrames, with optional filtering based on parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; no hardcoded credentials or malicious code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard API requests, JSON parsing, and data normalization. Obfuscation is present but appears to be a technique to conceal variable names rather than malicious intent. No signs of code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. Error handling is minimal but benign, primarily printing errors. The data flow is straightforward, with no untrusted data affecting critical system components beyond API responses. Overall, the code is consistent with legitimate data retrieval routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for fetching and processing public API data, with minor obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The current malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is moderate (around 0.4), and the security risk remains low (0.2).",
