  "purpose": "Static import statements from obfuscated module names, raising suspicion of obfuscation but no direct malicious activity observed.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules with obfuscated or nonsensical names.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, network calls, or system modifications detected in this code fragment.",
  "flows": "None present; only static imports without runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class/function names, potential code obfuscation, no visible logic or behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules with obfuscated identifiers, which could indicate code obfuscation or generated code. No evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification is present. The high obfuscation scores across reports reflect suspicion, but the absence of active malicious actions suggests a low malware likelihood. The low malware scores (around 0.1-0.2) are appropriate, while the high obfuscation scores (~0.75-0.8) indicate concern. The moderate security risk scores (~0.3-0.4) acknowledge the suspicion but lack concrete evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation but no direct malicious activity. The suspicion is justified due to the obfuscated identifiers, but without further analysis of the imported modules, malicious intent cannot be confirmed. The current scores are reasonable; a malware score of approximately 0.2, obfuscation score around 0.75, and overall risk near 0.4 appropriately reflect the situation. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to determine if they contain malicious code.",
