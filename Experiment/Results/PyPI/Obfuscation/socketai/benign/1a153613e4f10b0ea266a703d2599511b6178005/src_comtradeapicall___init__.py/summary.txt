  "conclusion": "The code shows signs of obfuscation but no direct malicious activity. The suspicion is justified due to the obfuscated identifiers, but without further analysis of the imported modules, malicious intent cannot be confirmed. The current scores are reasonable; a malware score of approximately 0.2, obfuscation score around 0.75, and overall risk near 0.4 appropriately reflect the situation. Further review of the imported modules is recommended to determine if they contain malicious code."
