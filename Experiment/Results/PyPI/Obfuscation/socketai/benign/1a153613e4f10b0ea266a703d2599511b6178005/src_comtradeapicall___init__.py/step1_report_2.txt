{
  "purpose": "Import various classes and functions from multiple modules within the same package, likely to organize and access different components of the application.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing classes and functions from local modules (.PreviewGet, .Async, .BulkDownload, .DataAvailability, .Metadata, .SUV, .AIS).",
  "sinks": "No sinks that handle untrusted input or perform data leaks; import statements themselves are non-executable and do not process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; import statements only load code modules.",
  "anomalies": "All imported identifiers appear as obfuscated or nonsensical strings, which could suggest code obfuscation. No visible hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious payloads are evident in the import statements alone. The pattern of import names is unusual and may indicate obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from internal modules with obfuscated-looking class/function names. There is no executable logic, user input handling, or network activity present. The repeated pattern of imported names with random or nonsensical strings suggests either deliberate obfuscation or generated code designed to hide malicious behavior. Without additional code, malicious activity cannot be confirmed, but the obfuscation raises suspicion. The import statements alone do not perform any harmful actions but may serve as a facade for malicious code elsewhere.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which may indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply obfuscation. No direct malicious actions or security risks are evident from this fragment alone, but the pattern warrants caution and further review of the actual imported modules.",
