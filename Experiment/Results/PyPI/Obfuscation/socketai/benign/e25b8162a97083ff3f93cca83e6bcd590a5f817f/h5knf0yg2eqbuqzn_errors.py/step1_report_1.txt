{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling, potentially for specialized error signaling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading sources are present in this code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data leaks, system calls, or external communications are present in this code.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows; the code solely defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated class names, which may be an attempt to conceal purpose. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, with two subclasses inheriting from the base exception. The class names are intentionally obfuscated, which can be suspicious but may also be for obfuscation or code compression. There are no data flows, input handling, or security-sensitive operations. No malicious behavior such as network activity, data theft, or backdoors is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be simple class definitions for custom exceptions, possibly obfuscated by using unclear class names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks within this fragment.",
