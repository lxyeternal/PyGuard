  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, likely for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class definitions (no external data sources or inputs).",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths as the code only defines exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class names; classes are simple pass-through extensions of Exception, with no additional logic.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated, non-descriptive names. The classes inherit from Exception and do not contain any methods, attributes, or logic. The naming pattern suggests an attempt to obscure purpose or make reverse engineering harder. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. The code does not contain malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior, but the obfuscated class names may be a sign of malicious intent or an attempt to conceal malicious code in a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names and no logic. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior within this snippet, but the obfuscation could be a technique to hide malicious intent in a larger codebase. Based on this isolated code, it appears benign, but caution should be taken if found within a larger, suspicious package.",
