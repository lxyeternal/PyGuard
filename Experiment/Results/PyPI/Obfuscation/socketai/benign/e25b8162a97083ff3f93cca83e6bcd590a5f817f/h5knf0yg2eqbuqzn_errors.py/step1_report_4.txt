  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, likely for error handling within a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external input or data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or outputs are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only class definitions with obfuscated class names that inherit from each other. The naming pattern appears intentionally obscured, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate code structure. No other suspicious behavior is evident.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with highly obfuscated and seemingly meaningless names. The classes inherit from each other, forming a hierarchy, but contain no methods or data. The obfuscated naming and lack of functionality could be benign obfuscation, but such patterns are often used to hide malicious logic or backdoors. There is no evidence of data leaks, network activity, or malicious payloads within this snippet. Without additional context or code, the intent appears ambiguous but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code solely consists of obfuscated class definitions for custom exceptions, with no direct malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation may be benign or an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Additional context is required for a definitive assessment.",
