  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for specific error handling scenarios.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from built-in Exception class.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or external data interactions observed.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow present.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names that resemble suspicious naming patterns; no other unusual code activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from each other and ultimately from the built-in Exception class. There are no data inputs, external calls, or suspicious behaviors such as network activity, data leakage, or code injection. The use of obfuscated class names could be an attempt to conceal purpose, but as it stands, it appears as benign class declarations for custom error handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code contains only class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet.",
