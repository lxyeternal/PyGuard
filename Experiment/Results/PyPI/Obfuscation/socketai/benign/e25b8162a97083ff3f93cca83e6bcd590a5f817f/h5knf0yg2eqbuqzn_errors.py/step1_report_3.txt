  "purpose": "Definition of custom exception classes for error handling, potentially for use elsewhere in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flows, input, or output operations present.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class names that are nonsensical and obfuscated, but no malicious code behavior or hidden functionality detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes, each inheriting from built-in exception classes, with obfuscated and non-descriptive class names. There are no data sources, sinks, or flow control mechanisms. The code appears to be intentionally obscured but functionally benign, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code consists solely of class definitions for exceptions with obfuscated names, showing no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation may suggest an attempt to hide the purpose, but functionally, it is benign.",
