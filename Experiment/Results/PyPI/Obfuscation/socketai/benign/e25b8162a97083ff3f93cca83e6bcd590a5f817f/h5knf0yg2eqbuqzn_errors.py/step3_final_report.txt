{
  "purpose": "The code defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from Exception or its subclasses, with no additional behavior or data.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, class inheritance hierarchy, class name strings",
  "sinks": "No data inputs, outputs, or external calls; class instantiation points are not present",
  "flows": "No data or control flow; classes are static definitions with no runtime data flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names, lack of methods or data, purely class inheritance without behavior",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three class definitions with obfuscated names, inheriting from Exception. There are no data inputs, external interactions, or malicious payloads. The obfuscation of class names is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The absence of behavior or data flows indicates benign intent. The high obfuscation score reflects the naming but does not imply maliciousness. Malware score is zero, security risk is low, and confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting of obfuscated custom exception class definitions with no malicious behavior or data leaks. Obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high risk without additional context. The scores are consistent with the analysis: malware=0, obfuscated=0.8, risk=0.2.",
