  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, API client for fetching event data. No evidence of malware, malicious activity, or supply chain compromise is present. The obfuscation warrants further review but does not currently indicate malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."
