      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The script appears to be a COVID-19 CLI tool with heavily obfuscated external dependencies. While no explicit malicious activity is visible, the obfuscation, suspicious import, and inconsistent code structure pose significant security concerns. The supply chain risk is elevated due to reliance on an opaque external module, and further analysis of that module is recommended before trusting or deploying this code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign factory for COVID data source classes with obfuscated naming. The reports' 'Empty response' messages are external API issues, not code flaws. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The security risk and malware scores should be low, with a moderate obfuscation score due to naming obfuscation."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of static string assignments with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate, with malware score at 0, obfuscation around 0.2–0.4, and risk near 0.1."

The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, heavily obfuscated data model with a validator referencing a missing field, likely a bug or obfuscation artifact. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security threat. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware score remains at 0, and overall security risk is very low."

The obfuscation is likely intended to conceal the code's purpose but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is low, and the code appears to be a legitimate data collection routine."
