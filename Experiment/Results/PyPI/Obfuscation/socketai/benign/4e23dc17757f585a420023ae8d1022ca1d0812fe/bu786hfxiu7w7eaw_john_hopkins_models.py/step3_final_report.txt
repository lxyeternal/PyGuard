{
  "purpose": "Define data models for COVID-19 statistics per country/region using Pydantic.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from external sources, likely JSON or API responses with fields like OBJECTID, Country_Region, Confirmed, etc.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data leaks are evident; the code only defines data structures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from external sources into the models via parsing; no malicious or insecure flows are present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and well-structured.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two Pydantic models with proper type annotations and field aliases. No suspicious logic, obfuscation, or malicious behavior is present. The reports indicate only 'Empty response' errors with no additional data, suggesting external data retrieval issues rather than code flaws. The models themselves are safe, and there is no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or vulnerabilities. The lack of detailed responses prevents any further security assessment, but based on the code, no risks are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, well-structured, and free of malicious intent. The reports' 'Empty response' errors are likely external issues, not code vulnerabilities. Therefore, the security risk and malware scores should be set to 0, and the code is considered safe.",
