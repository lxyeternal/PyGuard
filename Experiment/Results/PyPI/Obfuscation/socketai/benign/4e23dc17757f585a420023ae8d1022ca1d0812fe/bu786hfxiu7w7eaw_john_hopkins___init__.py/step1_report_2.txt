{
  "purpose": "Import a specific object or function named 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo' from a module named 'covid' within the same package.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads data from a local module named 'covid'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sink; the imported object is used internally within the package.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the 'covid' module into the current namespace via the import statement; no further flow evident in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifier 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo' appears to be a random, nonsensical string, which could suggest obfuscation or malicious intent. No other code present to analyze.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement with an unusual, obfuscated-looking identifier. No additional logic, data handling, or functions are provided. The identifier's randomness raises suspicion but could be benign or part of an obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or malicious actions from this snippet alone.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, the code does not demonstrate malicious behavior but features a suspiciously obfuscated identifier, which warrants caution. There is no immediate evidence of malware or security risks in this isolated code fragment.",
