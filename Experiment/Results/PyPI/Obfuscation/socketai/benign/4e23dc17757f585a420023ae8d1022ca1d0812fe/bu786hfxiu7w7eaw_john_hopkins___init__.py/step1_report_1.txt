  "purpose": "Import a specific attribute or module named 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo' from a local module called 'covid'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing a potentially obfuscated attribute from a local module.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as network or file operations are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the local 'covid' module to the current namespace through import.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute name 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo' appears obfuscated or nonsensical, which could indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or conceal malicious code, or could be a placeholder. No other code present to analyze further.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement for a specific attribute from a local module. The attribute name is complex and resembles obfuscated or randomly generated text, which may be suspicious. However, without additional context, this alone does not confirm malicious behavior. No direct data leaks, network activity, or code execution is visible in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement is suspicious due to its obfuscated attribute name, but there is no concrete evidence of malicious activity or security risks from this fragment alone. Further code review is needed to determine if this import is used maliciously.",
