  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a COVID-19 CLI tool with heavily obfuscated external dependencies. While no explicit malicious activity is visible, the obfuscation, suspicious import, and inconsistent code structure pose significant security concerns. The supply chain risk is elevated due to reliance on an opaque external module, and further analysis of that module is recommended before trusting or deploying this code."
