  "purpose": "A command-line interface to fetch and display COVID-19 statistics from various sources, with options for country-specific data and aggregate statistics.",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments, user inputs, and calls methods from an imported module 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo'.",
  "sinks": "Outputs data to the console using typer.echo and pprint; potentially calls functions that may process untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Command-line arguments and options are used as sources; data fetched via 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo' functions act as sinks when printing data.",
  "anomalies": "The imported module 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo' has an obfuscated name, which could suggest malicious intent or concealment. The code makes multiple calls to its methods without validating their outputs or understanding their behaviors. Some variables and data handling seem inconsistent or incomplete, e.g., 'data' variable used in print statements is undefined in context. The code dynamically executes functions based on user input but does not validate or sanitize the data. No hardcoded credentials are evident, but the obfuscated import raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The script provides a CLI for COVID-19 data retrieval, relying heavily on an imported, obfuscated module. The import name appears intentionally obscure, which can be a tactic to hide malicious code. The script reads command-line options and calls functions from this module accordingly. It prints the fetched data without validation or sanitization. The presence of undefined variables like 'data' indicates incomplete or poorly structured code, which could potentially be exploited if 'data' were manipulated. There are no explicit network connections, file modifications, or other typical malware behaviors, but the obfuscation and lack of transparency are suspicious. Overall, the code's behavior is mainly benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation and incomplete structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a CLI wrapper for fetching COVID-19 data with an obfuscated import, which raises suspicion. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation and incomplete code structure could potentially hide malicious behaviors. Further analysis of the 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo' module is necessary to confirm safety.",
