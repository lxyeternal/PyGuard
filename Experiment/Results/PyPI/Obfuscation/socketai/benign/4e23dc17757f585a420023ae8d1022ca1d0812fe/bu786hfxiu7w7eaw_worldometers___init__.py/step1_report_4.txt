  "purpose": "Import a specific symbol or function from a local module named 'covid'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module 'covid'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data output or network calls are visible.",
  "flows": "Importing a symbol from 'covid' may lead to its use elsewhere, but no direct flow within this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol has an obfuscated or non-descriptive name, which could be suspicious. The code is very minimal and does not provide context.",
  "analysis": "The code only imports a single, seemingly obfuscated symbol from a local module. The module name 'covid' could be benign or malicious, but based on this fragment alone, there is no malicious behavior. The obfuscated name could be an attempt to hide functionality, but without further code, this cannot be confirmed. The minimal nature of this code suggests it is part of a larger system; no direct malicious actions are visible here.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a simple import operation with an obfuscated symbol. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet alone. However, the obfuscated symbol and minimal context warrant cautious review of the broader codebase.",
