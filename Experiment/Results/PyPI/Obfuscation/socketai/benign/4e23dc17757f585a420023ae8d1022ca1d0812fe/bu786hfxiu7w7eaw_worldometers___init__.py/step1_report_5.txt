  "purpose": "Import a specific attribute or module from a local 'covid' package.",
  "sources": "Import statement from the local 'covid' module or package.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data flows that lead to potential data leaks or malicious effects are evident in this single import statement.",
  "flows": "No data flow analysis can be performed with a single import statement; it merely loads code from a local module.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo' appears to be a non-descriptive, obfuscated string, which could be an indicator of obfuscation or malicious intent. The filename 'covid' may be generic or obfuscated as well, which could be suspicious in some contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a single attribute from a local module. The attribute name is a long, seemingly random string, which is often used in obfuscation or to hide malicious intent. The import source is from a relative module, indicating it is part of a package. No other code, functions, or logic is present to analyze for malicious behavior. The absence of additional context makes it difficult to determine intent definitively, but the unusual naming pattern warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs a simple import from a local module with an obfuscated attribute name, which could suggest obfuscation or concealment. On its own, this does not confirm malicious activity but raises suspicion. Without further context or code, the overall risk remains uncertain but moderate due to the obfuscation.",
