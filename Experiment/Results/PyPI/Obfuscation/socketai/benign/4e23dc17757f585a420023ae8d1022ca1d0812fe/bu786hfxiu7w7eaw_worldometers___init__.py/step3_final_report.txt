{
  "purpose": "Minimal import statement importing an obfuscated symbol from a local module named 'covid'.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no other data input or external sources are evident.",
  "sinks": "None in this snippet; potential risk if the imported symbol is used maliciously elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Importing the obfuscated symbol; no further data flow shown in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Use of a highly obfuscated, nonsensical attribute name 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo', which raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only an import statement with an obfuscated attribute, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The high obfuscation score (0.7) reflects suspicion, while malware score (0.2) is low due to lack of evidence of malicious activity. The minimal context prevents definitive conclusions; further analysis of the 'covid' module and usage of the imported symbol is necessary. The scores are consistent with the cautious assessment that obfuscation alone warrants suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal and obfuscated, raising suspicion but lacking evidence of malicious behavior. The current scores are appropriate; further investigation into the usage of the imported symbol is recommended to determine if malicious activity exists.",
