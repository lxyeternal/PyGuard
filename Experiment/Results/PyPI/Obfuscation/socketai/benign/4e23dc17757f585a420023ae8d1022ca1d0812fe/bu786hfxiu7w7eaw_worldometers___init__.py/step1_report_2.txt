  "purpose": "Importing a specific object or function from a module named 'covid'.",
  "sources": "The import statement from '.covid'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or sensitive data leaks observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; only a single import statement with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "The imported attribute 'cQhxRxztRDnnXKvNHtvEpmghOdQlzBxo' appears to be a nonsensical, obfuscated, or randomly generated string, which could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No other code is present to evaluate.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement that pulls a specific attribute from a local module. The attribute name looks obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious. There are no other code constructs, data processing, or network interactions. The lack of context and the nonsensical attribute name raise concerns about obfuscation or malicious intent, potentially hiding malicious code or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal but suggests possible obfuscation, which warrants caution. Without additional context, the likelihood of malicious behavior cannot be confirmed, but the suspicious attribute name is notable.",
