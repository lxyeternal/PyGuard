  "purpose": "Assigning two string values representing data sources to variables and storing them in a list.",
  "sources": "Assignment operations at the beginning of the code for variables holding source names.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data processing or external calls present.",
  "flows": "Variables assigned with static strings, then stored in a list; no data flow to external systems or functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names that do not reveal their purpose, but no malicious code or secrets are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two string variables with source names ('john_hopkins' and 'worldometers'), then creates a list containing these variables. There are no external data inputs, no data processing, and no suspicious operations. Variable naming appears deliberately obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No external calls, no credential handling, or other security risks are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to simply store source identifiers in variables and a list, with no malicious or suspicious behavior detected. The obfuscated variable names are likely a form of simple concealment but do not suggest malicious activity.",
