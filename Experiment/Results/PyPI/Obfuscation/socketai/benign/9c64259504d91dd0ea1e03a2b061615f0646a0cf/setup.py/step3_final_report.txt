  "purpose": "Setup script for the 'haot4zof6pzolbtx' package, handling versioning, dependencies, and release commands.",
  "sources": "Reads version info via exec(), reads README.md, and requirements files; external URLs and email are hardcoded.",
  "sinks": "System calls for 'git' tagging and pushing, executing shell commands; file reads for version and README.",
  "flows": "Version info read via exec() -> system calls for git operations; file reads -> potential external dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, use of exec() on version file, external references ('dvGcPuPVzqEgEljBANbNdtGGvRhRpsvq') missing in snippet, superficial obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscation, using exec() and system calls typical for release automation. No active malicious payloads or network activity are evident. Obfuscation appears superficial, primarily hiding variable names. External references are undefined, indicating incomplete or external dependencies. The use of exec() and system calls could be exploited if external files are maliciously altered, but no direct malicious behavior is present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup with superficial obfuscation and potential for misuse via system commands. No active malware detected. Risks stem from obfuscation and external dependencies, but overall, the code appears benign in its current form.",
