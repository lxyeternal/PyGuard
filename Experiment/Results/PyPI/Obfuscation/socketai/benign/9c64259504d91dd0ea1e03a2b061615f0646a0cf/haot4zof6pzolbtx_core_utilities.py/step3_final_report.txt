  "purpose": "Utility functions for network operations, base64 decoding, shell spawning, and URL opening, with signs of obfuscation and potential misuse.",
  "sources": "User input prompts, environment variables, external API responses, and imported modules.",
  "sinks": "System calls (`system()`, `chdir()`), URL opening, DNS resolution, base64 decoding, and subprocess execution.",
  "flows": "User input or environment variables feed into DNS resolution, decoding, and system commands; external API data is fetched and processed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, incomplete code snippets (e.g., undefined variables like `GITHUB_PATH`, `text`), dynamic class creation, and functions executing system commands without validation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains utility classes with obfuscated identifiers, performing network lookups, decoding, spawning shells, and opening URLs. The use of `system()` and environment variables for executing commands poses security risks, especially without input validation. The obfuscation and incomplete code suggest an attempt to hide intent or complicate analysis. No active malicious payloads are evident, but the pattern of dangerous system interactions and data collection functions indicates potential for misuse in malicious contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high-risk patterns due to unsafe system calls, obfuscation, and data collection functions, warranting cautious handling. While no active malware is confirmed, the potential for exploitation exists, especially if misused or deployed in untrusted environments.",
