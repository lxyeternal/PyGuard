  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate penetration testing framework with obfuscation and dynamic features that could be misused if environment or modules are compromised. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present within this snippet. The suspicious patterns warrant cautious review, but the overall assessment indicates low likelihood of malware. The scores should reflect moderate obfuscation and low malware risk."
