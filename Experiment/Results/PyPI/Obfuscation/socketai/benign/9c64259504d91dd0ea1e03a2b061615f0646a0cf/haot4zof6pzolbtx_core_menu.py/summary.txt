  "conclusion": "The script functions as a potentially dangerous CLI utility with high obfuscation and risky system/file operations. While it does not contain explicit malware, its design and capabilities could be exploited for malicious purposes, such as deleting critical directories or executing arbitrary code if inputs are untrusted. The overall security risk is moderate to high, warranting cautious review and strict input validation before deployment."
