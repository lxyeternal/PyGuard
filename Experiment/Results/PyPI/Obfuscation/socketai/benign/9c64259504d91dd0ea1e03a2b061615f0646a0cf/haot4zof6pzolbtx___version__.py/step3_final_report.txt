{
  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable name.",
  "sources": "No input sources; static assignment in code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data flow or external communication.",
  "flows": "N/A; simple variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no malicious code or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string to a variable with an obfuscated name. There are no inputs, outputs, network activity, or other logic. The obfuscation of the variable name could be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is 0, security risk is minimal, and obfuscation is high but benign. No anomalies or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, performing a simple version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation alone does not constitute a threat.",
