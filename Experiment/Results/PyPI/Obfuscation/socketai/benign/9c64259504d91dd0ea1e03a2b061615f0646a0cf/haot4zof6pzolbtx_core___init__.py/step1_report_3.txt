{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple script that executes a command passed via the command line and prints the output.",
  "sources": "Input is read from command line arguments (sys.argv[1])",
  "sinks": "The code executes the command with os.system(), which can run arbitrary system commands, and prints the result.",
  "flows": "Command line argument -> os.system() executes command -> output printed to terminal",
  "anomalies": "Use of os.system() with untrusted input is risky; no sanitization or validation present. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code observed.",
  "analysis": "The script takes a command from the user via command line arguments, then directly executes it using os.system(). This introduces a significant security risk if the input is untrusted, as it allows arbitrary command execution. The code lacks validation, sanitization, or restrictions on the input. There are no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious payloads embedded. The code is straightforward and minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main risk lies in executing untrusted commands directly, which can be exploited for command injection or system compromise. There is no evidence of malicious intent or hidden malware, but the unsafe use of os.system() constitutes a security hazard.",
