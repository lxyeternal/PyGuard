  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code is not explicitly provided, but it appears to perform some form of data processing, possibly involving network communication or data handling.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, input functions, or external files, though specific source points are not explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network socket operations, file writes, or system command executions, depending on the functions used later in the code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as environment variables or input functions through processing functions and potentially to sinks like network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code snippets detected. The code contains standard function definitions and common data processing patterns. There are no signs of obfuscated code, malicious network activity, or hidden backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code begins with standard imports and function definitions. It does not contain any suspicious or unusual language features. There are no hardcoded secrets or credentials, nor any evidence of malicious payloads. The code structure appears straightforward with no obfuscated logic or hidden code execution. Without more context or complete code, there are no detectable malicious behaviors or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be normal data processing or application logic without suspicious activity.",
