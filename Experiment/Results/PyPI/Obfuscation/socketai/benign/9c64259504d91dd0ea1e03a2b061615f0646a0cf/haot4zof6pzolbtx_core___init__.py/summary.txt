  "conclusion": "The code is largely benign with no confirmed malicious payloads. The primary security concern is the unsafe use of `os.system()` with untrusted input, which should be remediated. Obfuscation and dynamic execution signs are moderate and do not constitute confirmed malware. The scores in the reports are appropriate; the malware score should be increased for Report 3 to reflect the command injection risk. Overall, the supply chain security posture is acceptable but requires attention to unsafe command execution practices."
