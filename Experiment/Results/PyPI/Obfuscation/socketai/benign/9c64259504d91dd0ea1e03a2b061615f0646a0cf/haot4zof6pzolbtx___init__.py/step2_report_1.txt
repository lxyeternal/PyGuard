  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their assessments, and evaluate the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** The code appears benign, employing standard practices, no obfuscation, no malicious indicators.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The detailed reasoning aligns with the scores. No suspicious behavior or code anomalies are evident.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 seems conservative but acceptable given the benign nature.\n- The malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** No code provided; no analysis possible.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The lack of code means no basis for any assessment.\n- Scores are appropriate.\n\n**Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** The code performs standard data processing, no malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.9\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is consistent; no suspicious patterns.\n- The security risk score of 0.2 is acceptable, reflecting minimal concern.\n- Malware score remains 0.\n\n**Conclusion:** Scores are justified.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, benign utility code, no suspicious activity.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0.2, confidence=0.75\n\n**Assessment:**\n- The reasoning is sound.\n- Slightly lower confidence (0.75) due to limited context but still acceptable.\n- Scores are consistent.\n\n**Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** No code provided; cannot analyze.\n- **Scores:** all zeros.\n\n**Assessment:**\n- Correct, given the absence of code.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the lack of malicious activity.\n- The scores assigned are consistent with the analyses.\n- No report suggests obfuscation or malware beyond zero, which aligns with the code's benign descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Estimation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0 — No evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:** 0 — No obfuscation detected or claimed.\n\n**Security Risk Score:** 0.2 — Slightly elevated, reflecting general caution, but given the benign code, this could be lowered to 0.1 or 0.0 if desired.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendations:\n\n- The current scores are reasonable and justified.\n- For increased accuracy, if the code is confirmed to be straightforward utility functions with no hidden behavior, consider lowering the security risk score to 0.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0 unless new evidence emerges.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:** Based on the provided reports and analyses, I agree with the current scoring, with a slight suggestion to reduce the security risk score to 0 if the benign nature is fully confirmed.",
