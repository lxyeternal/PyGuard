  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Code reading input data, environment variables, network connections, file operations, data processing functions.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write/read, environment variable access, data serialization, command execution points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or network inputs flow into processing functions; outputs are sent over network or stored locally, with no suspicious or malicious data flow detected.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious payloads observed; code appears standard and benign.",
  "analysis": "All reports indicate benign code with no malicious indicators, no obfuscation, and low security risks. The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk≈0.2) are consistent with the analyses. Confidence levels are high where code exists, and zero where no code is provided. The minimal security risk score reflects cautious assessment but aligns with the benign nature. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are identified. The assessments are internally consistent and justified.",
  "conclusion": "The code in question appears benign, with no evidence of malware, obfuscation, or significant security risks. The scoring across reports is appropriate and justified. Minor adjustments to the security risk score could be considered if further context indicates even lower risk, but current scores are reasonable.",
