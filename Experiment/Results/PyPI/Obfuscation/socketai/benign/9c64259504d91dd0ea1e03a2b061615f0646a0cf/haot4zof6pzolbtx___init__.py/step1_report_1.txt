  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the implementation of a Python package with various utility functions and modules, potentially for data processing or application support.",
  "sources": "Code reads data from environment variables, file inputs, and possibly network sources if present, though no explicit network code is visible.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data could reach print statements, logging functions, or database connectors if used, but no explicit sinks are identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources like environment variables or files through processing functions, but no clear malicious flow is detected in the visible code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code constructs are evident. The code uses standard libraries and patterns without obfuscation or unusual constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined thoroughly at start, middle, and end. It employs standard coding practices, with no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, code injection, or harmful system modifications. No suspicious network activity, backdoors, or embedded malicious payloads are detected. The absence of obfuscation and benign structure supports a non-malicious evaluation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided snippet. It performs standard utility functions without any malicious intent or suspicious anomalies.",
