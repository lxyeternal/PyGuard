  "purpose": "Analyzing Windows registry modifications to enumerate USB activity during user session startups for forensic or monitoring purposes.",
  "sources": "Registry modifications related to user session initiation, possibly reading registry keys associated with USB device activity.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive registry keys or system states that, if misused, could leak information or interfere with system behavior.",
  "flows": "Registry change detection during user session start → Data collection about USB activity → Possible reporting or logging of this data.",
  "anomalies": "The description indicates an analysis focus rather than actual code; no specific code snippets provided. The activity appears to be passive monitoring. No suspicious behavior such as data exfiltration, process hijacking, or backdoors is evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided text describes a process of analyzing registry modifications to monitor USB activity when a user session starts on Windows. It explicitly states it is for analytical purposes and not authoritative. There is no code or executable logic shown, only a description of behavior. The monitoring is passive and aimed at forensic analysis. No suspicious or malicious activities such as backdoors, data theft, or system damage are suggested by the description. The approach is typical of forensic or administrative monitoring tools, and nothing indicates malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided description, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The activity appears to be a forensic or monitoring process focused on registry analysis during user sessions. No security risks or suspicious anomalies are detected.",
