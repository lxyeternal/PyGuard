  "purpose": "Passive forensic analysis of Windows registry modifications related to USB activity during user session start, intended for monitoring or investigative purposes.",
  "sources": "Registry modifications observed during user login sessions, specifically related to USB activity indicators.",
  "sinks": "Analysis logs or reports derived from registry data reads, potentially exposing system or user activity details.",
  "flows": "Registry data being read during session start, leading to analysis or reporting outputs.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious behaviors detected; descriptions are purely analytical and passive.",
  "analysis": "The reports describe registry-based monitoring during user login, with no executable code or suspicious patterns. Malware scores are zero, indicating no malicious intent. Security risk scores are low (0.2), consistent with passive forensic tools. Confidence levels are high, reflecting reliance on descriptive summaries rather than code inspection. No anomalies or signs of malicious activity are present, and the activity aligns with standard forensic practices.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, passive registry analysis with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scoring is appropriate, and the reports are consistent and accurate in their forensic description.",
