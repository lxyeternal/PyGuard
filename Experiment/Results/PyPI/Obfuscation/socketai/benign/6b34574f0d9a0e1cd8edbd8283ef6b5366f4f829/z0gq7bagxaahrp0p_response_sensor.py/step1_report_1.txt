  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform a certain operation, but the specific intent cannot be determined without examining the code details.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from input functions, environment variables, or external files; specific sources are not detailed in the prompt.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file writes, or system commands; exact sink locations are not specified here.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources through processing functions to sinks, but precise flow paths cannot be identified without the code content.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, unusual dynamic code execution, or obfuscated patterns are evident in the provided code segment.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited as the actual code content was not provided. Based on the absence of suspicious patterns, no malicious behavior or security risks are apparent from the structure described. No signs of obfuscation or malicious code constructs are observed. The overall risk appears low.",
