{
  "purpose": "Assess open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, security risks, obfuscation, and anomalies based on provided reports.",
  "sources": "Input data sources, environment variables, network communication points, dynamic code execution functions (eval/exec), file I/O, user inputs.",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file writing, environment variable access, eval/exec calls, data leaks via print or logs.",
  "flows": "Input data → processing functions → potential eval/exec or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscated variable names, hardcoded secrets, suspicious network domains, unusual import patterns.",
  "analysis": "Most reports lack code, relying on descriptions; benign reports (1-4) are consistent with low risk and no malware. Report 5 indicates obfuscation and dynamic execution, warranting higher suspicion. Adjustments: increase malware score in report 5 to 0.4, security risk to 0.5, and obfuscation to 0.4. Overall, most code appears safe, with moderate concern in report 5. Confidence levels are appropriate given the descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "The overall assessment indicates low risk for most packages, with a moderate suspicion for report 5 due to obfuscation and dynamic code execution. Scores are adjusted to reflect these findings, emphasizing cautious suspicion where warranted.",
  "confidence": 0.75,
  "obfuscated": 0.3,
