  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate but highly capable security management CLI with features that could be exploited maliciously if compromised or misused. Its heavy obfuscation and extensive system control capabilities justify a moderate malware score (~0.2-0.3) but a high security risk (~0.65), emphasizing the need for careful handling and thorough review before deployment."
