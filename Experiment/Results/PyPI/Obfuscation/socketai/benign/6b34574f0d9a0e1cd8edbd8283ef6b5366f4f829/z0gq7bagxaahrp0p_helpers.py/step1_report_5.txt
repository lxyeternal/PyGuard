  "purpose": "Utility functions for UUID validation, input prompting with timeout, timezone conversions, path handling, date formatting, and CSV parsing.",
  "sources": "Input prompts via 'axdAwUtPIsMRhfcKykgAzSthpNLdnZMy', environment variables, and external modules (dateutil, sys, re, signal).",
  "sinks": "Potential data output through logging, stdout, and stderr. Path operations and date formatting are internal. CSV parsing reads data only.",
  "flows": "Input prompt (axdAwUtPIsMRhfcKykgAzSthpNLdnZMy) → possible logging or exit; UUID validation functions (ySlMnPVGrREspgaPuoyesNyXPiNdKjhC, EhxONXJUVZmmUqBADHQopLaZuLLlytST); Path handling (LSNLGnhgGXgCuhEHWVrTXFmnLkdSHoVc); Date formatting (JFisNuDvUrqQGzdFqferVGDHDLywgVkr); Path and timezone functions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or malicious code. Use of signal alarm for input timeout is standard but could be misused if misconfigured. No obfuscated code or dynamic execution present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of utility functions without external network calls, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution. UUID regex matches are standard validation. The input prompt with timeout uses signals and is safe. Path handling compares Windows and POSIX paths correctly. Date parsing and formatting uses 'dateutil' and handles strings and datetime objects safely. CSV parsing uses standard library without malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be benign utility functions intended for validation, user input, date/time management, and data parsing. No evidence of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or malware is present.",
