  "purpose": "Utility functions for UUID validation, user input with timeout, path handling, datetime formatting, timezone info, and CSV parsing.",
  "sources": "Regex matching for UUIDs, input prompts, path parts, datetime parsing and conversion, CSV string reading.",
  "sinks": "None; functions operate within safe, benign boundaries without external data or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Regex matches validate UUIDs; user input flows through input() with timeout; path handling compares path parts; datetime functions parse and convert timezone; CSV parsing reads data into dictionaries.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, obfuscation, or malicious patterns; standard library usage; signal-based timeout handling is typical but may be environment-dependent.",
  "analysis": "The code comprises standard utility functions with no network activity, obfuscation, or malicious intent. Regex patterns are straightforward, signal alarms are used for input timeout, and CSV parsing employs standard libraries. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, low security risk=0.1-0.2, obfuscated=0) are consistent with the benign, utility nature of the code. No suspicious patterns, backdoors, or vulnerabilities are evident. The use of signal.alarm is typical but could be environment-dependent; however, it does not introduce security issues here.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of benign utility functions with no malicious or supply chain security concerns. The assigned scores are appropriate, and no further action is warranted.",
