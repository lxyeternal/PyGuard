{
  "purpose": "The code appears to define function arguments for a script that interacts with CbResponseAPI, likely for some security or response automation task.",
  "sources": "The code does not explicitly read input or data but references parameters, possibly from command line or function call arguments.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or untrusted data processing are visible in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is demonstrated in the provided code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior are evident. The parameter names are obfuscated but do not inherently indicate malicious intent; they seem to be placeholders or auto-generated variable names.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet only shows argument annotations and a return description. There is no executable logic, no data processing, or network communication shown. The arguments suggest interaction with a CbResponseAPI, but without actual code implementing calls, the snippet does not reveal any malicious behavior. The naming of parameters appears obfuscated, but that alone is not suspicious, as obfuscated parameter names are common in some codebases or auto-generated code.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious activity. It appears to be a fragment of a function definition with no executable logic. No indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks are present based on this fragment.",
