  "purpose": "This code appears to define the argument parsing for a script that interacts with the CbResponseAPI, likely to perform security or incident response tasks.",
  "sources": "Arguments 'EIZCCMNhqFITcvprXIljYXpgTqXAncdu' and 'fmaHZdWvXRFMLDcMyJJxOVHyKrYkyzaW' are input data sources, representing an API object and parsed command-line arguments.",
  "sinks": "There are no direct data sinks or actions involving untrusted data within this snippet; it only defines argument placeholders and return values.",
  "flows": "Input arguments are passed into the function; no further data flow or processing is shown.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are highly obfuscated and nonsensical, suggesting possible obfuscation or intentionally obscure naming. The code snippet lacks actual implementation details, such as function calls, data handling, or API interactions.",
  "analysis": "The snippet is minimal and only shows argument definitions and return documentation. The obfuscated variable names could indicate an attempt to hide functionality. Without additional code, there are no evident malicious behaviors, but the obfuscation warrants caution. The absence of code execution or data handling limits the assessment, though the naming scheme and structure are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited and obfuscated code, there's no direct evidence of malicious activity. However, the obscured naming conventions and lack of implementation details could be indicative of an attempt to conceal malicious intent. Additional context or code is needed for a definitive assessment.",
