  "conclusion": "The code is likely a legitimate incident response framework with obfuscated identifiers. There is no current evidence of malicious activity, but the obfuscation and incomplete implementation warrant cautious review before deployment. The low malware score is appropriate, and the high obfuscation score is justified. The moderate risk score reflects potential for misuse if altered or misconfigured."
