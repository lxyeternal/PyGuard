  "purpose": "Configuration management for the 'cbinterface' module, including reading/writing config files, setting environment variables, and managing watchlist IDs.",
  "sources": "Reading configuration files from predefined paths, environment variables, and user input via function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Writing configuration files, setting environment variables, creating directories, and updating internal state based on config data.",
  "flows": "Configuration data is read from files and environment variables, then stored or updated in internal data structures or environment variables; configuration files are written back to disk.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or malicious code patterns; no obfuscation detected; directory creation occurs without explicit permission checks but is standard practice.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard configuration management tasks: reading config files, setting environment variables, creating directories, and managing watchlist IDs. It uses straightforward logic, proper error handling, and standard libraries. No network activity, code injection, or obfuscation is present. The functions manipulate environment variables and config files securely. Minor concerns include lack of validation on user input and directory permission checks, but these are common in such scripts and do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility with no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0 and obfuscated score of 0 are appropriate. The security risk score of 0.2 reflects minor potential misconfiguration or validation issues but does not constitute a security threat. Overall, the code is safe and standard for its purpose.",
