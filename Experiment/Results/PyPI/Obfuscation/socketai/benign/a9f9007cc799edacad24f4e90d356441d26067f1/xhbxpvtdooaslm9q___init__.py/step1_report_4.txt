{
  "purpose": "This code appears to store and assign personal information such as a name and email address, likely for identification or configuration purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads hardcoded string literals assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No clear sinks are present in this snippet; no untrusted data processing, network transmission, or file operations are evident.",
  "flows": "Data flows from hardcoded strings to variable assignments; no external or untrusted data sources or sinks are evident.",
  "anomalies": "All data is hardcoded; no external input, dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code is present. No suspicious functions or behaviors are observable.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns fixed string values representing a name, email, and version number to variables. There are no signs of malicious intent such as data exfiltration, dynamic code execution, or network activity. The data appears to be static and used for configuration or identification purposes. The absence of external data handling or suspicious functions suggests this code is benign and likely part of a larger configuration or metadata module.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and contains hardcoded personal and version information with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears benign with no suspicious activity or malware indicators.",
