      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration with obfuscation that does not indicate malicious intent. The syntax error should be fixed for proper execution, but it does not relate to security. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the code's nature."

      "conclusion": "The snippet is benign in isolation but warrants further inspection of the imported modules due to obfuscation. No direct malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation pattern justifies cautious review. The current scores are appropriate, and no immediate threat is confirmed."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate image loader with obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity or security risks are evident. The main concern is obfuscation, which warrants cautious review but does not currently indicate malicious intent. The network activity is standard and controlled. Overall, the supply chain risk is low, and the malware likelihood is negligible."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of obfuscated exception class definitions with no operational or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation does not imply malicious intent in this context. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately set to zero, with minor obfuscation concerns reflected in the scores. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and depends on external, unknown functions, which raises suspicion. However, no direct evidence of malicious activity is present. The scores assigned are appropriate, indicating moderate concern primarily due to obfuscation. Further investigation into external dependencies is advised before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility for generating user profile images with styled overlays and dynamic content. Despite obfuscation and malformed snippets, there is no evidence of malicious activity or malware. The primary concern is the potential misuse of external URLs, which should be monitored in deployment environments. Overall, the code is benign but warrants cautious review of obfuscated sections."

Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0. The obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. The overall security risk is low (~0.2). The reports are consistent and justified; no further modifications are necessary."
