  "purpose": "This code is a setup script for packaging the 'DiscordLevelingCard' Python library, defining package metadata, dependencies, and data files.",
  "sources": "Variables defining package data, dependencies, and metadata; passed into setup()",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks; static configuration only",
  "flows": "Package data and dependencies flow from variable definitions into setup()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; incomplete 'long_description' string causing syntax error",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py with obfuscated variable names that do not impact functionality. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or handling of untrusted input is present. The incomplete 'long_description' appears to be a syntax error, not malicious. The obfuscation seems cosmetic, possibly to hinder readability but not malicious. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration with obfuscation that does not indicate malicious intent. The syntax error should be fixed for proper execution, but it does not relate to security. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the code's nature.",
