  "purpose": "Set up configuration for packaging and distribution of the 'DiscordLevelingCard' Python library.",
  "sources": "Reads package dependencies, package data, project metadata, and version information.",
  "sinks": "Potentially vulnerable if data is sourced from untrusted inputs, but here it is static; no external untrusted data sources are used.",
  "flows": "No dynamic or external data flows; configuration data is statically defined and passed to 'setup()'.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated-like variable names; no actual obfuscated code or malicious code detected. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'setuptools' and calls 'setup()' with static metadata, dependencies, and package data. The variable names are unusual and obfuscated but do not affect functionality or indicate malicious intent. No code injection, network activity, or external data handling is present. The content appears to be a standard package setup script with obfuscated variable names, which may be intended to hinder straightforward reading but does not suggest malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This script appears to be a standard Python package setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks present in the provided code.",
