  "conclusion": "The script is a typical, benign setup configuration with obfuscation that does not indicate malicious intent. The syntax error should be fixed for proper execution, but it does not relate to security. The malware score is 0, and the security risk score is very low (~0.1), consistent with the code's nature."
