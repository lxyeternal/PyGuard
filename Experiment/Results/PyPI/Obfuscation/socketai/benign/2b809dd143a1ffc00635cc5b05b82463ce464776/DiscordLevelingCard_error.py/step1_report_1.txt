  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling, with inheritance structure.",
  "sources": "No external input or data read; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; class inheritance does not involve data flow or untrusted data handling.",
  "anomalies": "All class names are obfuscated, but they only define exception classes with no additional logic, data handling, or suspicious features.",
  "analysis": "The code contains three custom exception classes with non-descriptive, obfuscated names. They inherit from each other, forming a hierarchy of exceptions. All constructors simply call the superclass constructor with a message parameter, standard for custom exceptions. There are no external data inputs, no network calls, no credential handling, and no other typical malicious behavior. The obfuscated names could be suspicious but may also be a form of code obfuscation or just a naming convention. Overall, the code is benign and does not exhibit malicious or security risk behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines obfuscated exception classes without any malicious or security-sensitive actions. There are no indications of malware, data leaks, or security risks.",
