  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks observed in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Code consists solely of class definitions with obfuscated class names; no functional logic or data processing is present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from each other. There is no data input, output, or external interaction. The obfuscated class names may suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but as written, they only define exception types. No malicious activity, external communication, or security risk behavior is evident. The structure appears to be part of a larger, possibly intentionally obscured codebase, but this fragment alone does not demonstrate malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely contains obfuscated class definitions for exceptions, with no active logic or malicious behavior. No security risks or malware are indicated in this snippet.",
