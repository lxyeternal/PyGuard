  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling.",
  "sources": "No input data sources; only class definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing or output functions present.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only class inheritance and constructor calls.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names that do not reveal their purpose; no operational code or logic.",
  "analysis": "The code creates three custom exception classes with obfuscated names, all inheriting from each other. The classes only define constructors that pass messages to the superclass. There are no data processing, network operations, or data leaks. The obfuscated names suggest potential intent to hide the purpose, but based solely on this snippet, there is no malicious activity detected. The code appears to be a standard pattern for custom exceptions, albeit with obfuscated naming, which could be suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of custom exception class definitions with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks are evident in this fragment. The obfuscation may be for concealment, but it does not constitute malware or a security threat by itself.",
