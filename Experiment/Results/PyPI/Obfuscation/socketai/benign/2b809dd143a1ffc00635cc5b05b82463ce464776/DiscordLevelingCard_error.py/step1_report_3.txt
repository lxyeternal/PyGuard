  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes for error handling, with inheritance structure.",
  "sources": "No external data input sources detected; class definitions are static.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; no untrusted data handling or external communication.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving external or untrusted sources; inheritance chain is straightforward.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated and do not convey meaningful purpose. No logic, data handling, or external interactions present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from each other. There are no functions, data processing, or external calls. The obfuscation may be an attempt to hide intent, but as it stands, there is no malicious activity or security concern present in these class definitions alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code is solely defining obfuscated exception classes with no apparent malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be benign, although obfuscation may suggest hidden purpose if combined with other code.",
