{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes for error handling, with no specific operational logic.",
  "sources": "No external data input or data reading sources are present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling points are present.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows from sources to sinks, as the code only defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "The classes are named with obfuscated, non-descriptive identifiers. No operational code or logic is implemented beyond class inheritance.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception class definitions, each inheriting from a parent exception class. The class names are obfuscated and do not provide any functional or operational context. There are no inputs, outputs, data processing, or external interactions present. This pattern could be used to hide malicious behavior, but on its own, it appears benign. The lack of operational code or data handling reduces the likelihood of malicious intent. No suspicious behavior, such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors, is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be simple class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks based solely on this snippet. The obfuscation might be suspicious, but the code itself is benign.",
