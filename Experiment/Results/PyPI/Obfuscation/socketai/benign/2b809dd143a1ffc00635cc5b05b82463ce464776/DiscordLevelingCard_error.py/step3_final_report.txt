  "purpose": "Defines three custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from each other, serving as exception types within a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and constructors that pass messages to superclasses",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, network activity, or external interactions present",
  "flows": "Instantiation of exception classes with message strings; no external data flow or malicious data handling",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names; no operational or malicious code; only class inheritance and constructor calls",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of three custom exception classes with obfuscated names, inheriting from each other, with constructors passing messages to super(). There is no data processing, network activity, or operational logic. The obfuscation of class names could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The obfuscation scores are high, reflecting the non-descriptive class names, but do not indicate malicious intent. The confidence levels are high, and the reasoning is consistent across reports. No evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security risks is present. The code appears to be part of a larger system where obfuscation is used for concealment but does not constitute malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting only of obfuscated exception class definitions with no operational or malicious behavior. The high obfuscation does not imply malicious intent in this context. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately set to zero, with minor obfuscation concerns reflected in the scores. No further action or concern is warranted based on this snippet.",
