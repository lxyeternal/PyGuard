  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for generating user or rank profile images. Despite obfuscated variable names, there is no evidence of malicious payloads, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The supply chain risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at 0. The obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. The overall security risk is low (~0.2). The reports are consistent and justified; no further modifications are necessary."
