{
  "purpose": "The code performs image processing tasks, loading images from disk, manipulating them via external obfuscated functions, and saving the results locally.",
  "sources": "Reads image files from specified file paths and internal attributes; loads images via Image.open().",
  "sinks": "Saves processed images to disk; no network or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Image is loaded via Image.open() -> passed to external functions (obfuscated) -> processed -> saved to disk as PNG.",
  "anomalies": "Heavily obfuscated module, class, and function names; repeated load/save operations; reliance on external unknown functions; use of async functions without clear external network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code's obfuscation and reliance on external, undefined functions are suspicious but do not directly indicate malicious intent. No network activity, credential handling, or system modifications are visible. The external functions could be benign or malicious, but their lack of transparency warrants caution. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the low malware score reflects the absence of concrete malicious behavior. The overall risk is moderate, considering the potential for obfuscation to conceal malicious payloads. Further analysis of external modules/functions is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and depends on external, unknown functions, which raises suspicion. However, no direct evidence of malicious activity is present. The scores assigned are appropriate, indicating moderate concern primarily due to obfuscation. Further investigation into external dependencies is advised before deployment.",
