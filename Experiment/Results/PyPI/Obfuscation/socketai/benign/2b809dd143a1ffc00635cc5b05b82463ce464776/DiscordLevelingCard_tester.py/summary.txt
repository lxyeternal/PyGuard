  "security_risk": 0.45,
  "obfuscated": 0.9,

  "conclusion": "The code exhibits high obfuscation and depends on external, unknown functions, which raises suspicion. However, no direct evidence of malicious activity is present. The scores assigned are appropriate, indicating moderate concern primarily due to obfuscation. Further investigation into external dependencies is advised before deployment."
