  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from internal modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing classes or functions from local modules (discord_card, card_settings, sandbox, tester).",
  "sinks": "No direct sink points for untrusted data; no data output, network, or file operations observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; import statements are static and do not involve runtime untrusted input.",
  "anomalies": "Module names and class/function identifiers appear obfuscated, using non-descriptive, random strings. No comments, documentation, or meaningful identifiers are present. The imported entities are named with random strings, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with all imported entities named using non-descriptive, seemingly random strings. This obfuscation pattern is often used to hide malicious code or functionality. There are no evident security issues such as hardcoded credentials, network calls, or data leakage. However, the obfuscated nature of the identifiers raises suspicion about the intent of the package. Without examining the contents of the imported modules, it is impossible to definitively determine malicious behavior. The code does not perform any operations beyond importing, so no active malicious activity is evident in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is simple and only imports obfuscated entities from local modules. The obfuscation raises suspicion, but there is no direct evidence of malicious activity within this snippet. A full review of the imported modules is needed to assess potential malicious behavior or security risks.",
