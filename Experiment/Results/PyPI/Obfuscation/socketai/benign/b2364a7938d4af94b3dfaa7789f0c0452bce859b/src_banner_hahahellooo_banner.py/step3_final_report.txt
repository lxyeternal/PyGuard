{
  "purpose": "Display ASCII art and generate random lotto numbers",
  "sources": "Input data: None; code uses static functions and standard libraries",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no data leaks or external communications",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; functions execute benign operations independently",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; code is straightforward, with no obfuscation or suspicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one for rendering ASCII art using pyfiglet, and another for generating and printing a set of six unique random numbers between 1 and 45. Both functions perform benign, well-understood operations without external input, network activity, or data manipulation. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are present. The code relies solely on standard libraries and third-party ASCII art rendering, which are used benignly. The overall structure is simple and clear, with no signs of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing display and random number generation without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0 to 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary.",
