  "purpose": "The code provides functions to display stylized text and graphics, as well as generate random lotto numbers.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs; all data used are hardcoded or generated internally.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs to the console using print statements; no data is sent externally or saved.",
  "flows": "N/A – No untrusted data sources or data flows to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code behavior observed. The code appears to perform benign display and random number generation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a font rendering library (pyfiglet) and uses it to print stylized text. It also contains a function to print an ASCII art graphic. The 'lotto' function generates a list of six unique random numbers between 1 and 45. There are no external input sources, no network activity, and no dynamic code execution or obfuscation. The code functions as a display utility and a random number generator, with no suspicious behavior or malicious code present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, intended for visual display and random lotto number generation. It contains no malware or security risks.",
