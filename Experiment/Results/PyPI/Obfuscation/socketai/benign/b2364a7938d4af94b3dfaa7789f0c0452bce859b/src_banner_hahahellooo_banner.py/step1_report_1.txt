{
  "purpose": "The code defines three functions to display ASCII art and generate a random lotto number sequence.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input; it only generates outputs internally, with no user input or data fetching.",
  "sinks": "The code outputs ASCII art to the console and prints a list of lotto numbers; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "N/A - The functions do not process untrusted input or pass data between sources and sinks; they are purely for display and random number generation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior are detected. The ASCII art is static and decorative; the lotto function generates numbers randomly without external influence.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries, defines functions for text display and random lotto number generation, and executes no potentially malicious operations such as network access or data exfiltration. It appears to be benign, intended for visual display and simple random number generation without any suspicious or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is harmless, solely providing ASCII art display and random lotto number generation. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malicious payloads, or security risks.",
