{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to display ASCII art text, an ASCII art image, and generate a random lotto number combination.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external inputs or untrusted data sources; all data is hardcoded or generated locally within the functions.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks or data flows leading to external systems, network communication, or data leakage points.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows are present; the functions operate locally without external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The ASCII art appears static, and the random lotto function generates numbers without external influence or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a third-party library 'pyfiglet' to render stylized text, which is standard. It defines three functions: 'show()' for rendering ASCII art text, 'pic()' for printing ASCII art art, and 'lotto()' for generating a set of random numbers. All code operates locally and does not interact with external systems, read sensitive data, or include hidden behaviors. No hardcoded credentials or malicious code is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign with no signs of malicious intent, backdoors, or security risks. It performs simple display and random number generation tasks with no external dependencies or data leaks.",
