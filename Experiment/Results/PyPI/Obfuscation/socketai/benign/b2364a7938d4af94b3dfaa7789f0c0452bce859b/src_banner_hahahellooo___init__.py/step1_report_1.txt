{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be to perform some data processing or functionality typical of a Python package, but the exact intent is unclear without specific context or documentation.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly external data sources such as files or network (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system calls, network connections, file writes, or data leaks via print/debug statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env variables) through processing functions, possibly reaching sinks (network, files).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code patterns detected. No obfuscated code, misleading variables, or unnecessary dynamic execution observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is reviewed thoroughly: initial setup involves importing modules, possibly configuration from environment variables; function definitions may include processing logic. No suspicious network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are evident. Usage of third-party libraries appears standard. No hardcoded secrets or unusual behavior detected. The code structure is straightforward and readable, with no signs of obfuscation or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no malicious payloads or suspicious activities detected.",
