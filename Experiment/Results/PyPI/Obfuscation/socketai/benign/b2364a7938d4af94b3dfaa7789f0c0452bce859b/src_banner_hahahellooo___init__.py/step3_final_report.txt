{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be benign utility functions or system info gatherers with no malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Standard library imports, data processing functions, system info retrieval points",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, no network communication, no data exfiltration points detected",
  "flows": "Input data (if any) flows through utility functions without external or malicious influence",
  "anomalies": "Minimal comments, dynamic code elements, unconventional variable names, but no concrete obfuscation or malicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with no suspicious network activity, obfuscation, or malicious payloads. The confidence in benign nature is high (0.9). The minimal dynamic elements and unconventional naming raise slight suspicion but are not evidence of malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious behaviors are detected. The overall security risk is low, with a score of 0.2-0.3, reflecting minimal concern. The malware and obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility or system info gathering code with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, with a very high confidence level. Slight suspicion due to minimal comments and dynamic elements does not warrant higher risk scores. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use.",
