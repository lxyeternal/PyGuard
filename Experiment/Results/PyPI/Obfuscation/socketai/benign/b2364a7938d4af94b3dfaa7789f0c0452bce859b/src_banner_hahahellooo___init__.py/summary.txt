  "conclusion": "The code is benign utility or system info gathering code with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, with a very high confidence level. Slight suspicion due to minimal comments and dynamic elements does not warrant higher risk scores. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use."
