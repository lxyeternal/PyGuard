  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a simple demonstration or utility script that interacts with the operating system, possibly for testing or utility purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, possibly user input via command line arguments, and system information (like hostname or current directory).",
  "sinks": "Data is outputted via print statements and possibly written to files or network sockets if present, though no explicit network activity or file writing is evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables or command-line inputs flow into system calls or variable assignments, then possibly outputted via print statements or stored in variables for further use.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious backdoors, or obfuscated code are present. No unusual code patterns, dynamic execution, or code that manipulates sensitive data suspiciously are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code utilizes standard Python libraries to gather system info and environment variables. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or code injection are detected. The code structure is straightforward and uses typical constructs. No anomalies or malicious indicators are found. The code appears benign, possibly for utility or testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It is a benign script focused on gathering and displaying system or environment information with no evidence of malicious intent.",
