  "purpose": "This code appears to perform some data processing and network communication, possibly for retrieving or transmitting data.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, file reads, or network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "Network transmission functions, file write operations, or database queries.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (environment, files, network) through processing functions to output sinks (network, files).",
  "anomalies": "Any hardcoded credentials, obfuscated sections, or unusual control flow. Lack of documentation or presence of dynamic code execution hints.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal and does not contain obvious hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity. No obfuscated code or suspicious imports are detected. The flow seems typical of data retrieval and transmission. Absence of dynamic execution or code injection points reduces suspicion. No evident malware indicators like data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage routines are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the analysis, the code does not exhibit signs of malicious behavior or malware. It appears to be a standard data processing script with no evident security risks.",
