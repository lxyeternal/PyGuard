{
  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be the definition of utility functions for data processing and possibly some form of network interaction, although the specific intent is not entirely clear from the code snippet provided.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from imported modules, environment variables, and potentially from external inputs such as network or user inputs, though explicit input functions are not evident.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or data transmissions, but none are explicitly visible in the provided code.",
  "flows": "There are no clear source-to-sink data flows in the visible code, as it primarily defines functions and imports modules without evident data transmission or external interactions.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains no hardcoded credentials or suspicious functions. It uses standard library functions and appears to be straightforward without obfuscated code or malicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly composed of standard Python function definitions, imports, and variable declarations. There is no evidence of malicious code such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The absence of input handling or output operations makes it unlikely to contain malicious payloads. The code structure and usage are typical for utility or data processing scripts.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious behavior, supply chain attacks, or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious or malicious patterns detected.",
