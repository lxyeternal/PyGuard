      "conclusion": "The code is entirely benign, performing display and random number generation without any malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores assigned in the reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, security risk: approximately 0 to 0.1) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. No modifications or further scrutiny are necessary."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign utility or system info gathering code with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The low security risk score is appropriate, with a very high confidence level. Slight suspicion due to minimal comments and dynamic elements does not warrant higher risk scores. Overall, the dependency appears safe for use."
