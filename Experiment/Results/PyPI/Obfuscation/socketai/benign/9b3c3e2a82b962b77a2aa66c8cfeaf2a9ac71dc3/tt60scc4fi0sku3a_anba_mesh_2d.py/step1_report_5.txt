  "purpose": "Shebang line indicating script execution with Python 3 interpreter.",
  "sources": "None, as the code contains only a shebang line and no actual code to read data.",
  "sinks": "None, no data processing or output occurs.",
  "flows": "None, no data flows or execution logic present.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only a shebang line with no executable code or data handling; this is minimal and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line, which is used to specify the interpreter for script execution. No functions, data inputs, outputs, or logic are present. Without additional code, there are no sources, sinks, or flows to analyze. This minimal script does not exhibit any malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code contains only a shebang line and no executable logic or data handling. It does not demonstrate malicious intent or security issues.",
