  "purpose": "This script contains only a shebang line and no executable code or data handling.",
  "sources": "None; the script does not read input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data flows or potential data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows exist due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the script is a minimal shebang line with no suspicious or unusual code.",
  "analysis": "The code is solely a shebang line (`#! /usr/bin/env python3`) with no additional logic, functions, or data handling. There are no sources, sinks, or data flows, and no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risks. The reports correctly identify the code as inert and benign, assigning malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0. Confidence scores are high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No anomalies or suspicious patterns are present. The analysis confirms that the script poses no security threat.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, inert shebang line with no malicious intent or security issues. All reports are accurate and justified in their scoring. No further action or suspicion is warranted.",
