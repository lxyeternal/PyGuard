  "purpose": "The code appears to be a shebang line indicating the script is intended to be run with Python 3.",
  "sources": "The shebang line itself does not read input or data; it only specifies the interpreter.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present in the provided code snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flow is observable from the given snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains only a shebang line with no additional code or logic, which is unusual for a standalone script.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is merely a shebang line indicating the script should run with Python 3. There is no executable code, data handling, or logic present. Since this is just a minimal snippet, no security issues, malicious behaviors, or data flows can be identified. Without further code, it is impossible to determine intent or risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is simply a shebang line with no additional logic or code. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in this minimal fragment. It is likely just the start of a script template or placeholder.",
