{
  "purpose": "This code serves as a script header, indicating the script should be run with Python 3, with no additional logic or data handling.",
  "sources": "The shebang line itself (`#! /usr/bin/env python3`), which specifies the interpreter.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks; the code contains no executable statements or data flows.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code is only a shebang line with no further instructions.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; the code is a minimal shebang line with no suspicious or unusual features.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line, serving as an interpreter directive. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or network activity. The minimal content indicates it is a script header or placeholder. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, reflecting the benign nature. Confidence is high due to the simplicity and clarity of the code. No suspicious patterns, malicious behavior, or obfuscation are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script header with no malicious or security concerns. The assessments and scores are accurate and consistent with the content.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
