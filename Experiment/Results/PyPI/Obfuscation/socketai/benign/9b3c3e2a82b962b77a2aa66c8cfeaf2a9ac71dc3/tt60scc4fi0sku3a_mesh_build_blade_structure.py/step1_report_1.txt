{
  "purpose": "The code specifies the environment to run with Python 3 interpreter.",
  "sources": "None; the code does not read any input or data.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no operations that process untrusted data or perform critical actions.",
  "flows": "No data flow is present as the code only contains a shebang line.",
  "anomalies": "The code is only a shebang line with no executable logic, which is unusual but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line indicating the script should be run with Python 3. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or other logic. The absence of any executable code or dependencies makes it impossible for this snippet to contain malicious behavior or security issues. This is typical for a script header.",
  "conclusion": "This code is just a shebang line, serving as an interpreter directive, with no executable content or malicious intent. It presents no security risks or suspicious behavior.",
