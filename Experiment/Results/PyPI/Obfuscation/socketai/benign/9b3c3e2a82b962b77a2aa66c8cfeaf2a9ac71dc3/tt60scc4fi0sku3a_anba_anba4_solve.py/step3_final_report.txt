  "flows": "N/A (no source-to-sink data flow).",
  "anomalies": "Absence of code, no suspicious or unusual constructs, no obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a shebang line '#!/usr/bin/env python3' with no additional logic, data handling, or system calls. All reports correctly identify the minimal, benign nature of this snippet. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security risks are present. The high confidence scores are justified given the simplicity. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The code poses no security threat or malware risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign script header with no malicious intent or security concerns. All assessments and scores are appropriate and consistent with the minimal content.",
