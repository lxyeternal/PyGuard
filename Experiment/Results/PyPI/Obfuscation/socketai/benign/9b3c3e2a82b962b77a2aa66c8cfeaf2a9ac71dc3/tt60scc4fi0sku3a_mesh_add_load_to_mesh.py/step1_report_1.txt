  "purpose": "The code appears to be an empty script with only a shebang line, serving as a placeholder or a script stub.",
  "sources": "No sources of input or data are present in this snippet.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are present due to lack of code.",
  "anomalies": "The script contains only a shebang line without any executable code, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or suspicious behavior are evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of a shebang line indicating the script should be run with Python 3. There are no functions, variables, imports, or executable statements. This minimal script does not perform any actions, read data, or contain any security-related behavior. The absence of code suggests it may be a placeholder or incomplete.",
  "conclusion": "This code is an empty Python script with no executable content. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks present. It appears safe but also non-functional in its current form.",
