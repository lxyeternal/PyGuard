  "purpose": "The code is a shebang line indicating that the script should be run with Python 3, used to specify the interpreter for executing the script.",
  "sources": "The shebang line itself; no input or data reading occurs here.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the line does not perform any data output or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows present; this is merely a script interpreter directive.",
  "anomalies": "The shebang line is standard and not unusual; no anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a shebang line, which instructs the operating system to run the script with Python 3. It does not include any logic, data reading, or execution of malicious commands. There are no code constructs, variables, or external calls present that could indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This is a standard shebang line with no malicious intent or security concerns. It is a common practice to specify the interpreter for script execution and does not pose any security risk.",
