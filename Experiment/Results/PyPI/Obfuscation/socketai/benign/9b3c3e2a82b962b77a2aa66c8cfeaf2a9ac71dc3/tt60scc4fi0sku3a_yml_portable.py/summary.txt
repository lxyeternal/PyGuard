  "conclusion": "The code is a benign configuration utility with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior or payloads. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (0.2) are justified. Obfuscation is moderate but not malicious. The overall assessment indicates a low-risk, non-malicious codebase primarily involved in YAML configuration management."
