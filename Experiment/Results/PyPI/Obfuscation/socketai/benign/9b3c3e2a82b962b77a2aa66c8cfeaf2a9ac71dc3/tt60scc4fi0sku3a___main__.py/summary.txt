  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated CLI wrapper for blade analysis workflows. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The primary issue is the obfuscation, which should be reviewed further, especially the purpose of encoded strings and the external classes invoked. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate, if heavily obfuscated, application script."
