{
  "purpose": "The code attempts to import a module from a relative package and retrieve its version information.",
  "sources": "importlib.metadata.version, __version__ assignment, the import statement for '.geometry'",
  "sinks": "Potential use of imported module's data or version info (not explicitly shown here), exception handling for package version retrieval",
  "flows": "importlib.metadata.version retrieves package version -> __version__ is assigned based on this",
  "anomalies": "Use of an obfuscated or non-descriptive variable name 'CWKWCXWKevOpOpMlaECxrcYtIvYlXAOq'; the variable 'NAME' used in version retrieval is undefined, which would cause a runtime error; the import of a module from a relative path without context or validation could be suspicious if it leads to malicious code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class or function with a seemingly random name from a local module. It then attempts to retrieve the version of a package identified by 'NAME' using importlib.metadata. However, 'NAME' is undefined within this scope, which would raise a NameError. The variable 'CWKWCXWKevOpOpMlaECxrcYtIvYlXAOq' is assigned a base64-like string but is not used further. The code structure suggests obfuscation or incomplete code; it does not perform any malicious actions directly but contains suspicious elements like undefined variables and obfuscated identifiers. No external data is read or written, and no network activity is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be incomplete or obfuscated, with an undefined variable 'NAME' that would cause an error. The presence of nonsensical variable names and the structure suggest potential obfuscation or partial code. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system manipulation. Overall, this seems to be benign or incomplete code with no malicious intent.",
