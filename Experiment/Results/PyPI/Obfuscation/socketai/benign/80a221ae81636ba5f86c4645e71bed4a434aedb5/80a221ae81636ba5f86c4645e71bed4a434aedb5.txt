The obfuscation increases suspicion but does not translate into malicious intent based on the provided snippets. Continuous monitoring is recommended if external inputs could influence class attributes or template paths."

Slightly elevating the malware score enhances the accuracy of the assessment, aligning with the observed features. The overall security posture warrants caution and further investigation before deployment."
