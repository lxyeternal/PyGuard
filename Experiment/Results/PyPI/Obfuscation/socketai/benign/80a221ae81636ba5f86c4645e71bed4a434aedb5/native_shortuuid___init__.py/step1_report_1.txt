  "purpose": "Importing validation, admin, and fields modules, and retrieving package version information.",
  "sources": "Imports from current package modules; dynamic import of 'pkg_resources' to get package version.",
  "sinks": "The dynamic import of 'pkg_resources' and get_distribution call may act as a source of untrusted data if manipulated.",
  "flows": "Code imports internal modules, then attempts to retrieve package version info via dynamic import and method call, with exception handling assigning 'unknown'.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic import and get_distribution within a try-except block is standard, but could be exploited if the environment or package name is manipulated externally.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily performs module imports and attempts to fetch the package version using 'pkg_resources'. The imports are from local modules and are not suspicious by themselves. The dynamic import and call to get the version could be a point of concern if the environment is compromised, but this is a common pattern for version retrieval. The exception handling sets a variable to 'unknown' if the import or distribution fetch fails, which is standard practice. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. No obfuscated code or suspicious behavior is detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard package version retrieval logic with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It does not contain malware or obfuscation. The overall security risk is very low.",
