{
  "purpose": "Implementing a Bayesian Batch Normalization layer for 2D or 3D inputs in a neural network.",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries: math, torch, torch.nn, torch.nn.functional.",
  "sinks": "None identified; no data sinks such as network connections, file writes, or environment variable usage are present.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; the code is a class definition with no executable data flow or untrusted input handling.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears intentionally obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a class that extends torch.nn.Module, intended for Bayesian Batch Normalization. The class docstring describes its function and references external resources. No functions, methods, or executable code beyond class and docstring are included, indicating a typical neural network layer implementation. No suspicious or malicious code constructs, network activity, or data leakage mechanisms are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This source code appears to be a benign, albeit obfuscated, implementation of a neural network layer with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It follows standard PyTorch practices and contains no hidden or suspicious logic.",

  "obfuscated": 0.2,
