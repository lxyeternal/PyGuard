{
  "purpose": "Implementing a Bayesian Batch Normalization layer for 2D or 3D inputs in a neural network",
  "sources": "Imports from standard libraries (math, torch, torch.nn), class definition and docstring",
  "sinks": "None identified; no external data or untrusted input handling observed",
  "flows": "No specific data flow from sources to sinks; code defines a module with no execution of untrusted data",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, no suspicious code constructs, no obfuscation, no malicious logic",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard libraries and defines a neural network module with a descriptive docstring. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors. The class appears to be a straightforward implementation of a Bayesian Batch Normalization layer, with no hidden or obfuscated code. The code structure and comments suggest it is for legitimate model training purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign implementation of a custom batch normalization layer with Bayesian prior parameters. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
