  "conclusion": "The code demonstrates obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns indicative of potential malicious behavior, especially in reports with eval usage and suspicious strings. While no explicit malicious payloads are confirmed, the risk remains moderate due to obfuscation and suspicious patterns. The scores assigned are justified and align with the evidence, warranting cautious monitoring and further investigation."
