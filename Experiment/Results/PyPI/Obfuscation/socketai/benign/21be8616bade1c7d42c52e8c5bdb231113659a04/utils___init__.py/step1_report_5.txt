  "purpose": "Import functions or objects 'cytpwvsMBqFMKPNhEYJoEeLXIUylbDvp' and 'unfreeze' from a local module 'freeze_model'.",
  "sources": "Import statement reads data from a local module within the package.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; only import statements are used.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks; this code only performs an import operation.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers 'cytpwvsMBqFMKPNhEYJoEeLXIUylbDvp' and 'unfreeze' appear to be obfuscated or randomly named, which can be suspicious. The obfuscated name suggests possible concealment of malicious intent, but without further context, it could also be an internal naming convention.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement from a local module. The identifiers imported are unusually named, which may indicate obfuscation or intentional concealment. No other code, input handling, or network operations are present. The absence of other code makes it difficult to assess malicious behavior directly, but the obfuscated names warrant caution. There is no indication of malicious actions such as data exfiltration, network communication, or system modification within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a straightforward import from a local module with obfuscated identifiers. On its own, it does not demonstrate malicious behavior but the obfuscated names suggest further review of the module's contents is necessary to rule out malicious intent. Based solely on this snippet, the malware risk is low, but the obfuscation raises a minor concern.",
