  "conclusion": "The code exhibits unsafe dynamic code execution patterns through exec(), which introduces high security risk. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or malicious intent, but the pattern could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. The obfuscation and unsafe practices justify high risk scores. The primary recommendation is to refactor the code to eliminate exec() and replace it with safer, direct method calls or class references."
