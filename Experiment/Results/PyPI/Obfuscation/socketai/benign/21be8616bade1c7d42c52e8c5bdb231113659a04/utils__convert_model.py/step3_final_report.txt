  "purpose": "Modifies neural network models by replacing layers with Bayesian variants or reverting them, using dynamic code generation and execution.",
  "sources": "Model layers, class type checks, string representations of classes.",
  "sinks": "exec() calls executing constructed code strings.",
  "flows": "Inspecting layer types, constructing code strings based on class names and parameters, executing via exec().",
  "anomalies": "Use of exec() with strings built from class names; obfuscated variable names; heavy reliance on string manipulation for code execution.",
  "analysis": "The code performs model modifications by dynamically generating and executing code to replace or revert layers, primarily using exec(). This pattern is inherently risky due to potential code injection if class names or parameters are influenced externally. Variable names are intentionally obfuscated, which complicates understanding but may be an attempt to conceal intent. No external input or data exfiltration is evident, and no malicious payloads are detected. The main concern is the unsafe use of exec(), which can execute arbitrary code, posing a security risk. The pattern does not necessarily indicate malicious activity but is a significant security concern that should be addressed.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits unsafe dynamic code execution patterns through exec(), which introduces high security risk. There is no evidence of malicious payloads or malicious intent, but the pattern could be exploited if inputs are manipulated. The obfuscation and unsafe practices justify high risk scores. The primary recommendation is to refactor the code to eliminate exec() and replace it with safer, direct method calls or class references.",
