  "purpose": "Documentation or comment describing a Bayesian Linear model, likely part of a larger implementation for Bayesian neural networks.",
  "sources": "No actual data sources; only parameter definitions and comments referencing external PyTorch code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or data output observed.",
  "flows": "No data flows; only descriptive comments and parameter declarations.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of executable code, functions, or data handling; only comments and parameter definitions. No suspicious or unusual code behavior.",
  "analysis": "The provided code consists solely of comments and parameter descriptions related to a Bayesian Linear model, referencing PyTorch's linear module. There is no executable logic, data input, or data output. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious instructions are present. The absence of actual implementation code means there's no observable malicious activity or security risk. The comments suggest intent to modify or override PyTorch's linear layer, but without code, this is purely descriptive.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is purely descriptive comments without executable code or data handling. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. No anomalies or malicious intent are evident.",
