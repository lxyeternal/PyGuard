  "purpose": "Documentation or comment describing a Bayesian Linear module, likely part of a neural network implementation.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources or data reads; references to external PyTorch source code link.",
  "sinks": "No sink functions or untrusted data outputs identified.",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The provided text appears to be a docstring or comment describing a Bayesian Linear module with parameters prior_mu and prior_sigma, referencing PyTorch's linear module. There is no executable code, data handling, or network operations included. The reference to the PyTorch source code is benign and common in documentation. No suspicious code patterns, malicious behavior, or security risks are evident from the text.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign comment/documentation snippet related to a Bayesian Linear layer. It contains no malicious or suspicious behavior, no data leaks, and no security risks.",
