  "sinks": "No untrusted data outputs or data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink is observed.",
  "anomalies": "The code is purely descriptive comments with no executable logic, code, or data handling.",
  "analysis": "The snippet consists solely of comments and a URL reference, describing a Bayesian Linear layer with parameters prior_mu and prior_sigma. No executable code, data input/output, or logic is included. No signs of malicious behavior, code injection, or suspicious activity are present. The mention of overriding functions from PyTorch indicates intended extension or modification, but there is no actual implementation shown. The comments do not contain obfuscated or malicious code, nor do they perform any actions that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is purely descriptive comments and references without executable content. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It appears to be part of documentation or planned implementation, with no security concerns identified.",
