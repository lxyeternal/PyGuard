  "purpose": "Documentation describing a Bayesian Linear layer with prior parameters, referencing PyTorch's linear module.",
  "sources": "Comments and documentation strings referencing prior_mu, prior_sigma, and PyTorch's torch.nn.modules.linear.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "None, as there is no executable code or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; only descriptive comments and references.",
  "analysis": "The provided snippets are purely documentation and comments about a Bayesian Linear layer, referencing prior parameters and PyTorch's linear module. There is no executable code, data handling, or logic. No suspicious activity, obfuscation, or malicious code is present. The references to overriding and notes about other arguments are standard documentation. The absence of code, data flow, or suspicious constructs indicates a benign nature. Scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, securityRisk=0) are consistent with this analysis. Confidence is high due to the clarity and non-executable nature of the snippets.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippets are benign documentation with no malicious intent or security risks. The current scores are appropriate and should remain at zero for malware, obfuscation, and security risk.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
