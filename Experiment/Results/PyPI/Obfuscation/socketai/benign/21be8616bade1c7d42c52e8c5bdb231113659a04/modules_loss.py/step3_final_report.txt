  "purpose": "Utility function to compute the KL divergence of a Bayesian neural network, with configurable reduction mode and optional last layer focus.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'reduction' (string), 'last_layer_only' (bool), and model object 'qxVzxBUULipwGeCtFhhBljfJSPPPUYrP'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network, file, or system calls are present in the snippet.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used within the function to compute KL divergence; no external data flows are evident.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable name 'qxVzxBUULipwGeCtFhhBljfJSPPPUYrP'; malformed and inconsistent comments; incomplete code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose appears to be a standard utility for calculating KL divergence in a Bayesian neural network. The obfuscated variable names and malformed comments suggest either auto-generated or intentionally concealed code, which warrants caution. No malicious actions such as network communication, file manipulation, or data exfiltration are evident. The scores from reports align with this: low malware likelihood, high obfuscation suspicion, and low to moderate security risk. The primary concern is obfuscation, which could hide malicious intent, but there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior in the provided snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is likely a benign utility function with suspicious obfuscation. No concrete malicious activity is detected, but the obfuscation warrants further review before deployment or trust in production environments.",
