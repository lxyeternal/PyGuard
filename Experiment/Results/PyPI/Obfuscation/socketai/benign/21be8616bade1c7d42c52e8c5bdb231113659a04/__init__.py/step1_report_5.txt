{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be part of a Python package or module, primarily importing submodules and setting a version identifier.",
  "sources": "Import statements importing from local modules (.modules and .utils), and version assignment.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data handling is present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No data flows are observable; the code only imports modules and assigns a version.",
  "anomalies": "There are no suspicious or unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated patterns. The import statements are standard for modular Python projects.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all contents from a local module named 'modules' and imports a local 'utils' module. It also sets a version number. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The absence of any dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic indicates this is typical package initialization code.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a standard component of a Python package setup, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks.",
