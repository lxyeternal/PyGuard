  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and compare their assessments with the code provided.\n\n**Code Recap:**\n```python\nfrom .modules import *\nfrom .utils import\n__version__ = 1.2\n```\n\n**General observations:**\n- The code is a typical package `__init__.py` file.\n- It uses relative imports to bring in all symbols from `.modules` and a specific import from `.utils`.\n- It sets a version number.\n- No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is present.\n- The use of `from .modules import *` is generally discouraged due to namespace pollution but is common in package init files.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  All reports agree that the code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security issues. They correctly identify that the code is standard package initialization.\n\n- **Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the report's logic?**  \n  The reports are consistent and accurate. They note the use of wildcard import as a potential concern but recognize it as common practice. No factual errors are apparent.\n\n- **Scores assigned:**\n  - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is appropriate given the simplicity of the code.\n  - Malware scores are 0 across all reports, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n  - Security risk scores are low (mostly 0.2 or 0), which seems reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Evaluation:\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  Given the code's simplicity and benign nature, the scores are appropriate. The only slight concern is the use of `from .modules import *`, which could theoretically hide malicious code if the modules are compromised, but this is speculative and not evidenced here. Therefore, a malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n- **Should any scores be adjusted?**  \n  No. The assessments are consistent with the code's content.\n\n- **Justification for higher risk scores?**  \n  Since no malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or suspicious behavior are observed, higher scores are unwarranted.\n\n- **Malware score considerations:**  \n  The malware score of 0 across all reports is correct. There is no indication of malicious code or behavior.\n\n- **Obfuscated score considerations:**  \n  All reports correctly identify the code as straightforward and not obfuscated.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- **Overall malware score:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated score:** 0  \n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (or 0), since the only concern is the wildcard import pattern, which is a common but potentially risky practice if modules are compromised.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code is benign, and the scores reflect that appropriately. No adjustments are necessary.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0.2 (due to wildcard import, but generally low risk)\n\nThis aligns with the assessments provided.",
