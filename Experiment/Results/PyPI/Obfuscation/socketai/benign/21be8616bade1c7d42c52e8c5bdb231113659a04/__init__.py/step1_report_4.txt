{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module imports and define a version number, likely for a Python package or module initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules ('modules' and 'utils') and version assignment",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input or output points are evident in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imports are executed at runtime, but no data flows from source to sink; version is a static assignment",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code patterns are present; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscation, or malicious constructs",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward module imports and version setting, typical in Python package setup. The import of all from a local module and a separate utils module is common practice. No suspicious or malicious behavior is apparent. There are no signs of malicious code injection, data leaks, or covert channels. The code is minimal and clean, with no obfuscated logic or hidden functionalities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a typical module initialization script with no indications of malicious intent or security risks.",
