{
  "purpose": "The code is setting up module imports and defining a version number, likely as part of a larger Python package or module initialization.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.modules and utils), and a version number assignment",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing occurs in this snippet; no untrusted data handling or outputs",
  "flows": "No data flows are evident in this snippet; imports and version assignment are static and direct",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; simple import statements and a version assignment without any suspicious or unusual code",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local module named 'modules', imports a local 'utils' module, and sets a version number. There is no dynamic code execution, no handling of untrusted input, and no indication of malicious behavior. The import style and version assignment are typical for package initialization. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a straightforward module initialization snippet with no malicious intent or security risks identified.",
