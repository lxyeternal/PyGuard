{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up module imports and define a version number, likely as part of a package's initialization script.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules (modules and utils). No external input reading observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks; no untrusted data handling or output functions.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code mainly involves import statements and a version assignment.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, but the use of relative imports is typical for package initialization; no suspicious or unusual code behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of import statements and a version variable. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or hidden backdoors. The imports could be used for legitimate module loading. The version number is standard. No obfuscated or complex code structures are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment appears benign, serving as a typical package initialization snippet with no indication of malicious intent or security risks.",
