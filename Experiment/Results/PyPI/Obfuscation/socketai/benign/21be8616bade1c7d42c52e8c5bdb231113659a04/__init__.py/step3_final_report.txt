  "sinks": "No data sinks or external connections present",
  "flows": "Imports and version assignment, no data flow to external systems",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'from .modules import *' which can be risky but is common in init files",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard __init__.py for a Python package, performing module imports and setting a version. No dynamic code, network activity, or untrusted data handling is present. The wildcard import could be a minor concern but is typical in package init files and does not indicate malicious intent. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or security issues. The use of wildcard import warrants caution but is not inherently malicious. The malware score is appropriately set to 0, and the overall security risk is very low.",
