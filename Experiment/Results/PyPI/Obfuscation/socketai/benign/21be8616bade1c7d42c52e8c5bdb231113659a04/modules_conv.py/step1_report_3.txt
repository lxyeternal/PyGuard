  "purpose": "Documentation for applying Bayesian Convolution in a PyTorch model, specifically for 2D inputs with prior parameters.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; primarily docstring and method references.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output generation observed.",
  "flows": "No identifiable data flow or source-to-sink paths; primarily descriptive comments and method references.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated description without implementation, no code logic, no use of environment variables, credentials, or dynamic code execution.",
  "analysis": "The provided text is a docstring describing a Bayesian Convolution method for 2D inputs, referencing PyTorch's convolution implementation. There is no executable code, no dynamic data handling, and no suspicious or malicious logic. It appears to be part of a documentation or class method description rather than functional code. No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely descriptive documentation for a Bayesian Convolution layer, with no executable or malicious code. It poses no security risks or malware concerns.",
