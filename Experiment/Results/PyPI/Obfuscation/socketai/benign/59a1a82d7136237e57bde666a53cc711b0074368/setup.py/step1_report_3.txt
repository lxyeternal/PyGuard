  "purpose": "Setuptools setup script for package installation with SCM versioning",
  "sources": "No explicit external input sources; relies on the setup() function from setuptools",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or potential data leaks identified",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; setup() invocation is standard for packaging",
  "anomalies": "Empty except block that prints nothing, which is unusual but not malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code",
  "analysis": "The script is a minimal setup.py that calls setuptools.setup() with a version scheme, wrapped in a try-except block that catches all exceptions but does nothing with them, then re-raises. The try-except with an empty print statement appears redundant but not malicious. No external data input, no suspicious code flow, and no unusual obfuscation or backdoors detected. The code appears standard for packaging and does not contain malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with no malicious intent or security risks. The empty except block is unusual but not harmful. Overall, no security concerns identified.",
