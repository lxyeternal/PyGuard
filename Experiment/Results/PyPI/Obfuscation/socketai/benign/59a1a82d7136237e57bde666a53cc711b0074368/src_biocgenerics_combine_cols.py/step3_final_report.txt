  "purpose": "Utility functions for combining data structures such as numpy arrays, scipy sparse matrices, and pandas DataFrames through concatenation and stacking.",
  "sources": "Function parameters, class attributes, and data passed into concatenation functions.",
  "sinks": "Data concatenation outputs; no external data leaks or system modifications observed.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into concatenation functions, with shape and type checks, resulting in combined data structures.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, conditional imports with broad exception handling, inconsistent type references (e.g., 'sp.sparray' instead of 'sp.spmatrix'), silent exception suppression.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides data concatenation utilities supporting multiple data formats. Obfuscation and silent exception handling are suspicious but do not directly indicate malicious activity. No network, file, or system modification behavior is evident. The functions perform shape validation and type conversions, typical for data processing libraries. The obfuscation may serve to support multiple formats or conceal internal logic but does not inherently imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of data utility functions with obfuscated naming, supporting multiple data formats, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The low malware score (0.1) aligns with the absence of malicious activity, while the high obfuscation score (0.75) reflects the intentionally obscured identifiers. The overall security risk remains low (0.2), but the obfuscation and silent exception handling warrant cautious review in supply chain contexts.",
