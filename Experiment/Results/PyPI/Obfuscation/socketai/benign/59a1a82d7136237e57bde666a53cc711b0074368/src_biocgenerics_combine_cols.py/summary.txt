  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of data utility functions with obfuscated naming, supporting multiple data formats, with no evidence of malicious behavior. The low malware score (0.1) aligns with the absence of malicious activity, while the high obfuscation score (0.75) reflects the intentionally obscured identifiers. The overall security risk remains low (0.2), but the obfuscation and silent exception handling warrant cautious review in supply chain contexts."
