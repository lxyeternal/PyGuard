  "purpose": "Utility functions for string processing, column formatting, and terminal-aware display formatting.",
  "sources": "Sequence indexing, terminal size detection via os.get_terminal_size() with fallback.",
  "sinks": "Internal string concatenation and formatting; no external data or network interactions.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (sequences, terminal size) flow through formatting functions to produce a string output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no secrets, credentials, or external system modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code provides string extraction, maximum length calculation, and terminal-aware column formatting. It uses superficial obfuscation but performs standard utility tasks without external system interaction or malicious logic. No signs of data leaks, network activity, or backdoors are present. The obfuscation is likely for code style or minimal hiding, not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility for terminal display formatting. No malicious activity, backdoors, or security risks are evident. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe and low risk.",
