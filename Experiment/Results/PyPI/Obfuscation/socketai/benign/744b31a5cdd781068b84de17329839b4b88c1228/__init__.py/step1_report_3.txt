{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, with no clear indication of malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input sources are not explicitly defined; the code does not read from external data, files, or network sources directly.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are limited to standard output and variable assignments; no untrusted data handling or sensitive operations are evident.",
  "flows": "The code processes internal variables with no apparent source-to-sink data flow involving untrusted input or external data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious constructs observed. The code structure is straightforward, without obfuscation or unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The script performs basic data manipulations or utility functions without external data ingestion or network communication. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or insecure practices are present. The absence of environment variable usage, credential handling, or network activity suggests low risk. No malicious patterns or malware behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The analyzed code does not exhibit any signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be benign, with no suspicious or harmful operations identified.",
