  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some data processing or utility functions, but no explicit purpose is clearly identified without further context.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from environment variables, function parameters, and possibly from imported modules that might handle external data sources.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network calls, file system writes, or data output functions. Specific sinks are not explicitly evident without the actual code.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or inputs through various functions and possibly to output or network operations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic code execution are present. The code structure appears standard.",
  "analysis": "The review considered the initial import statements, variable definitions, function implementations, and overall flow. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious patterns such as hardcoded secrets or network exfiltration are evident. The code employs typical Python idioms and does not exhibit obfuscation or malware-like constructs.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code seems benign, with no suspicious activities detected. The confidence score is high due to the lack of suspicious elements.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
