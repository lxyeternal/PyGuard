  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, input functions, dynamic execution functions (eval/exec), network or file operations, external libraries.",
  "sinks": "Network connections, file system, environment variables, system commands, data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into dynamic execution or network transmission points.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval/exec functions, obfuscated variable names, dynamic code execution, limited code context, potential for misuse.",
  "analysis": "The code contains dynamic execution functions (eval/exec) which pose potential security risks, especially if misused. No concrete malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage is observed. The code appears straightforward with no obfuscation or suspicious patterns. The confidence in benign assessment is high, but the presence of dynamic features warrants cautious scoring. The malware score should be increased slightly to reflect potential misuse, and the risk score should be adjusted accordingly. Scores are consistent with the evidence, but monitoring dynamic features is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The code shows no definitive malicious activity but includes dynamic execution features that could be exploited. Slightly elevated malware and risk scores are justified to account for this potential. Overall, the dependency appears benign but warrants cautious oversight.",
