{
  "purpose": "The code defines four custom exception classes with obfuscated names and internal string attributes, likely serving as placeholders or for obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and internal string attributes; no external input reading or data fetching observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks such as data transmission, file writing, or execution of untrusted data identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows detected; classes are simply defined with static attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are intentionally obfuscated; internal string attributes appear as random or nonsensical strings. No functional code or logic execution is present. No indications of malicious behavior or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code creates multiple custom exception classes with unusual, obfuscated names. Each class contains a single class attribute assigned a seemingly random string. There are no methods, input handling, data processing, or external communication. The purpose appears to be code obfuscation or placeholder class definitions without any active malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior. It seems to be obfuscated or placeholder code with no harmful intent or security risks.",
