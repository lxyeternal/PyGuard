{
  "purpose": "Obfuscated exception classes with static string attributes, likely placeholders or intended to hide purpose.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with static attributes; no input, external data, or dynamic data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; no untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; static class attributes do not process or transmit data.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names; no functional code or data processing; only static assignments.",
  "analysis": "The code defines four custom exception classes with obfuscated names and static string attributes. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or external interactions. The obfuscation suggests an intent to hide purpose but does not indicate malicious behavior. No signs of code injection, data leakage, or malicious activity are present. The static nature and lack of external calls imply benign intent, though obfuscation can be used to conceal malicious code in larger contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with high obfuscation but no active malicious behavior or security risks. The malware score is 0, and the security risk is very low (~0.1-0.2). The obfuscation warrants caution if integrated into larger codebases, but in isolation, it is harmless.",
