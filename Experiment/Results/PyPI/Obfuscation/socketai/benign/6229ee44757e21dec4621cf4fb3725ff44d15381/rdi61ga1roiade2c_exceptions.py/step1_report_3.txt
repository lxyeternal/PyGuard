{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names and string attributes, possibly for future use in exception handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and attribute assignments within the classes.",
  "sinks": "No obvious sinks that process untrusted input or data flows to external systems.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from source to sink is present in this code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and attribute names are deliberately obfuscated, containing random strings. No actual logic or data processing occurs. No hardcoded credentials or secrets are visible.",
  "analysis": "The code contains four custom exception classes with obfuscated names. Each class inherits from a standard Python exception type. Inside each class, a class variable is assigned a seemingly random string. The obfuscation appears intentional, perhaps to hide the true purpose or for obfuscation. There are no input sources, external calls, network activity, or code that performs any operation beyond class and attribute definition. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious network activity, is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated but functionally harmless. It defines custom exception classes with no active logic, input handling, or external interactions. No signs of malware or malicious intent are present.",
