  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated attribute names and string values.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, attribute assignments",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks for untrusted data, no I/O operations, network activity, or data leaks present",
  "flows": "Class attributes initialized with strings but not used in any data flow",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names, no functional logic, no clear purpose beyond obfuscation; no data handling or processing",
  "analysis": "The code consists of four custom exception classes inheriting from standard Python exceptions. Each class contains a single class attribute with an obfuscated name and a string value that appears arbitrary. There are no methods, no data processing, and no interaction with external inputs or outputs. The obfuscation and lack of functional code suggest possible intent to hide malicious code or to act as a decoy, but on its own, it does not perform any harmful actions. The classes are isolated with no indication of how they are used. The static string attributes are not accessed, modified, or used within any logic.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be intentionally obfuscated with meaningless class and attribute names and no functional behavior. There are no signs of malicious activity or security risks based on the provided snippet. It likely serves as a placeholder or is part of a larger, potentially obfuscated codebase but contains no malicious or harmful behavior in this isolated fragment.",
