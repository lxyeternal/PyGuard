{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes with obfuscated names and assigns seemingly random string values to class variables, likely intended as internal constants or placeholders.",
  "sources": "No clear data input sources such as user input, network calls, or file reads are present.",
  "sinks": "No operations such as data transmission, file writing, or system modifications are present.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink data flows or any data processing routines.",
  "anomalies": "The class and variable names are intentionally obfuscated, and the string constants appear nonsensical or random. No actual malicious behavior or suspicious activity is evident. No hardcoded credentials, external calls, or obfuscated execution methods are observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions inheriting from built-in exception types. Each class contains a single class variable assigned a string that seems arbitrary. There are no functions, methods, or operations that process data, communicate externally, or perform malicious actions. The obfuscation may be a method to hide intent, but in this isolated fragment, it appears as a benign obfuscation rather than malicious malware.",
  "conclusion": "This code does not exhibit any malicious behavior or security risks based on its content. It appears to be just obfuscated exception class definitions with no malicious intent or suspicious activity detected.",
