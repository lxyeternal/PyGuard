  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with obfuscated class names and class attributes, likely for internal use or to hide their purpose.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and class attribute assignments, which do not process external input.",
  "sinks": "No evident data sinks; no operations that process or output untrusted data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is present; the code only defines classes and attributes.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class names and attribute names, which may be used to hide intent. No actual functional or malicious code actions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of four custom exception classes with intentionally obfuscated names and attribute names assigned to seemingly random strings. There are no functions, input/output operations, or any data processing. The structure appears to be designed to hide the purpose or make static analysis more difficult, but there are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, network activity, or code injection. The code could be used as part of a malicious package, but on its own, it merely defines classes with no operational behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate malicious behavior or security risks directly. It contains obfuscated class definitions that could be used in malicious contexts, but as-is, it appears to be harmless. The obfuscation raises suspicion but does not constitute malicious activity by itself.",
