  "purpose": "Build configuration script for a cryptography-related Python package involving native C extensions, with platform-specific compilation and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, command-line arguments, file reads (README.md), platform and Python version detection.",
  "sinks": "Compilation of C sources, setup() invocation, custom classes raising errors to prevent certain commands.",
  "flows": "Source inputs (environment, args, files) influence compilation and setup functions; no external data exfiltration or network activity detected.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable and class names, complex argument parsing, conditional compilation based on platform and Python version, classes raising RuntimeError to block commands.",
  "analysis": "The code is a complex, obfuscated build setup for a cryptography package, performing standard compilation and environment detection. No malicious code, network activity, or backdoors are evident. Obfuscation appears to serve concealment rather than malicious intent. The use of custom error-raising classes suggests protective measures. Overall, the script is a legitimate, albeit heavily obfuscated, build configuration.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a legitimate build setup with high obfuscation but no signs of malicious activity or supply chain attack. The static analysis supports a malware score of 0, obfuscation score around 0.8, and a low security risk score (~0.2).",
