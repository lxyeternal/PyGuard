  "conclusion": "The code is a password hashing utility with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (approximately 0.2) are appropriate. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) reflects the placeholder strings and confusing comments. Caution is advised, and further de-obfuscation and review are recommended to confirm no hidden malicious logic."
