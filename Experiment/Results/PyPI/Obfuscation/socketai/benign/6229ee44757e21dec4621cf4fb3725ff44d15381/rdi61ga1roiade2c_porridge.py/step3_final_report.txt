  "purpose": "A helper class for password hashing ('boiling') with server-side secrets and configurable cryptographic parameters, including password verification and re-hashing logic.",
  "sources": "Input parameters such as 'secrets', 'password', and 'boiled' password strings; internal thread spawning and memory allocation during hashing and verification.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive data in 'secrets' and password inputs; no external data exfiltration or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into cryptographic functions for hashing and verification; no external data flows or network transmissions detected.",
  "anomalies": "Repeated placeholder strings ('QRdfkHVvvTyKyzdyyYqmQSPecdCUSbKi') and obfuscated variable names suggest intentional obfuscation; comments are garbled or nonsensical, indicating possible concealment or incomplete documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a password hashing helper with configurable parameters, designed for secure password storage. The heavy obfuscation and placeholder strings raise suspicion but do not provide evidence of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors. The cryptographic functions appear standard, and no hardcoded secrets or malicious patterns are evident. The obfuscation likely aims to conceal implementation details or is an artifact of code obfuscation techniques. Overall, the code's core purpose aligns with legitimate cryptographic practices, and no indicators of sabotage or malware are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a password hashing utility with significant obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior. The low malware score (0) and low security risk (approximately 0.2) are appropriate. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) reflects the placeholder strings and confusing comments. Caution is advised, and further de-obfuscation and review are recommended to confirm no hidden malicious logic.",
