  "purpose": "Provides utilities for PEM formatting, parsing, and base64 encoding/decoding of cryptographic data.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions, data split by lines in PEM parsing functions.",
  "sinks": "Internal data processing within functions; no external system or network interaction.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through encoding/decoding routines, with parsing functions extracting base64 data between PEM markers.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, but standard cryptographic routines; no malicious patterns or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard PEM formatting and parsing, along with base64 encoding/decoding. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but logic is straightforward and typical for cryptographic utilities. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious code is present. The functions accept untrusted input but do not perform unsafe operations beyond normal data handling. Obfuscation does not imply malicious intent; it affects readability but not security. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the low security risk score reflects the benign nature of the routines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard implementation of PEM and base64 handling routines. No signs of malicious activity, backdoors, or supply chain risks are evident. Obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The overall security posture is low risk.",
