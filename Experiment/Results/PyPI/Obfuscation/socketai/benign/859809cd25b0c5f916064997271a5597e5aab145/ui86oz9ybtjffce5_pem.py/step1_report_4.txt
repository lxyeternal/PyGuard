{
  "purpose": "This code appears to handle PEM encoding and decoding of data, specifically base64 encoding/decoding with PEM headers and footers, likely for cryptographic purposes such as key or certificate processing.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from function parameters and splits base64-encoded PEM data within the YSGdYZTzBxMLVzuWDNRyBqVQzfbVjVZj parameter, which may originate from external sources.",
  "sinks": "The code writes encoded data to return values and outputs base64-encoded PEM formatted data, but does not write to external systems or files directly.",
  "flows": "Input data is encoded or decoded via base64 and PEM formatting functions; the data flows from input parameters through encoding/decoding functions, with no external network or system modifications.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains obfuscated variable names, which makes understanding its purpose more difficult. No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious network activity are present. The functions themselves are typical for cryptographic PEM processing. No signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, reverse shells, or system damage are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code provides utility functions for PEM formatting: 'yiYIzgbqnAgztkZgvhndPGtvzEPaJuqY' creates PEM headers and footers for a given string; 'bDuqowHmcpUAkxiqcRKtYVQaNsslSOUy' extracts base64-encoded data between PEM markers; 'ZiPkbZTRjyBtDGoYEXiZQmsogztzKLsS' decodes base64 PEM data into raw bytes; 'kVUpBxrAxgjcrXgJrlVRZUtrenBmcwRv' encodes bytes into base64 PEM format. All functions perform standard cryptographic data formatting and parsing without malicious behavior. Variable names are obfuscated, but their behavior aligns with common cryptographic processing. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent, and no external data exfiltration or system impact mechanisms are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of utilities for PEM encoding/decoding of cryptographic data. There are no signs of malicious activity, malware, or security risks. Its obfuscation appears to be an attempt to make analysis more difficult, but the functions themselves are standard and benign.",
