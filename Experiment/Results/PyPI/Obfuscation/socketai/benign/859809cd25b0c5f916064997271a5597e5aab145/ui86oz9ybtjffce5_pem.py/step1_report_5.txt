{
  "purpose": "The code appears to handle PEM encoding and decoding, converting data to and from base64, with functions to create PEM headers/footers, encode data into PEM format, and decode PEM back to bytes.",
  "sources": "Input data provided to functions yiYIzgbqnAgztkZgvhndPGtvzEPaJuqY, ZiPkbZTRjyBtDGoYEXiZQmsogztzKLsS, and kVUpBxrAxgjcrXgJrlVRZUtrenBmcwRv; data can originate from external sources when functions are called with untrusted inputs.",
  "sinks": "Decoded data outputs from kVUpBxrAxgjcrXgJrlVRZUtrenBmcwRv; encoded PEM data from kVUpBxrAxgjcrXgJrlVRZUtrenBmcwRv; potentially sensitive data handled but no direct malicious sink observed.",
  "flows": "Input data → base64 encoding/decoding → PEM header/footer processing → output bytes; no external network or system commands are invoked.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials or backdoors. Functions perform standard PEM handling. The code includes multiple nested functions for encoding and decoding, but no signs of obfuscation or malicious logic.",
  "analysis": "The script provides utilities for PEM encoding/decoding and base64 transformations. The functions process input data, adding PEM headers/footers, and convert between base64 and binary data. There is no evidence of data exfiltration, network activity, or malicious backdoors. The code is straightforward and uses common cryptographic data handling patterns. No malicious or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard PEM encoding/decoding utility without malicious intent. It handles data transformation securely and predictably. No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious behavior found.",
