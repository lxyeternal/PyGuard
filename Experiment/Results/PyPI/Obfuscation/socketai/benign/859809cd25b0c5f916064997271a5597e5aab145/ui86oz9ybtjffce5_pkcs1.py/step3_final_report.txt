  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility functions including hashing, padding, signing, encryption, and decryption, with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sources": "Input data from function parameters and imported modules; no external data sources or network inputs evident.",
  "sinks": "Cryptographic primitives processing data; no direct data leaks or system modifications visible.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through padding, hashing, signing, encryption routines, and back to output, with internal transformations.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with non-descriptive class and variable names; suspicious module names (.common, .transform, .core, fRVIMmnCZXAfnrNYnqtCBCltJHAnOpei); complex docstrings and custom exceptions.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard cryptographic routines such as padding, hashing, signing, and encryption. Obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal functionality, which could be benign or malicious. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The imported modules are unnamed and could hide malicious code. The functions appear to be utility routines typical of cryptography libraries, but the obfuscation warrants caution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily cryptographic utility functions with significant obfuscation. No direct evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity or data theft is present. However, the high level of obfuscation and suspicious module names suggest potential concealment. Further review of external modules and the overall application context is recommended before deployment.",
