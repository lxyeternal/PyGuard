  "purpose": "Cryptographic prime number generation using multiprocessing to find large primes efficiently.",
  "sources": "Random number generator (rsa.randnum), primality test (rsa.prime), input parameters nbits and poolsize.",
  "sinks": "Pipe communication to send the generated prime back to the main process.",
  "flows": "Worker processes generate candidate numbers, test for primality, and send the prime through the pipe to the main process.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; infinite loop in worker processes relying on external termination; __all__ list contains 'getprime' but no such function name present.",
  "analysis": "The code employs standard cryptographic prime generation with multiprocessing for efficiency. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are evident. The process flow is straightforward: generate candidates, test primality, send prime, terminate processes. The inconsistency in __all__ is a minor flaw but does not impact security. Overall, the code is benign and intended for cryptographic use.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, cryptographic prime generator with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the process is standard for cryptographic key setup. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0.",
