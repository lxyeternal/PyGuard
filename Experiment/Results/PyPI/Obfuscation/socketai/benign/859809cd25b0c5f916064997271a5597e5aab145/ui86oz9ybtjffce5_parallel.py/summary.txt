  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, cryptographic prime generator with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation does not imply malicious intent, and the process is standard for cryptographic key setup. The security risk is minimal, and the malware score should remain at 0."
