  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign RSA cryptographic utility with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The current malware score of 0 and low risk score are justified. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe for use, and scores are consistent with its functionality."
