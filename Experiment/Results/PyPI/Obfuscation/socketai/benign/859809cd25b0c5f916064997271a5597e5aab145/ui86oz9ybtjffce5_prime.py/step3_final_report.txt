  "purpose": "Cryptographic utility functions for RSA key generation, primality testing, and GCD calculation.",
  "sources": "Input parameters for functions, internal library calls for randomness and primality testing.",
  "sinks": "No external data or system modifications; internal computations only.",
  "flows": "Input parameters to primality tests and GCD, internal library functions for randomness and primality, no external data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Superficial obfuscation of variable and function names; no malicious code or suspicious external communication.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard RSA cryptographic routines: GCD via Euclid's algorithm, Miller-Rabin primality testing, prime generation, and key size determination. It uses the 'rsa' library for randomness and primality checks. No network, file, or system modification code is present. Obfuscation appears superficial, likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. The functions are correctly implemented, and no hardcoded secrets or backdoors are detected. The malware score is appropriately 0, as no malicious activity is evident. The obfuscation score (~0.7) reflects the non-descriptive naming, but the core logic is standard and benign. The security risk score (~0.2) is low, consistent with cryptographic utility code. Overall, the code is benign, serving legitimate cryptographic purposes, with superficial obfuscation, and no signs of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign RSA cryptographic utility with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity, backdoors, or malicious behavior are detected. The current malware score of 0 and low risk score are justified. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe for use, and scores are consistent with its functionality.",
