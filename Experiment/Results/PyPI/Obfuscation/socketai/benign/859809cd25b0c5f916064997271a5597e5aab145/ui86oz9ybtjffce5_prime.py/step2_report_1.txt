  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check the code, and evaluate the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Summary:** The code implements RSA-related functions: GCD, primality testing, prime generation. No malicious activity detected. Obfuscation superficial.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.7\n\n- **Assessment:** The code appears standard for cryptographic key generation, with obfuscated names but no malicious patterns. The low malware score aligns.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, standard cryptographic routines with obfuscated variable names. No malicious activity. Slight concern due to obfuscation.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.7\n\n- **Assessment:** No signs of malicious behavior; obfuscation is superficial.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Summary:** Again, RSA utilities with obfuscated names. Standard algorithms, no malicious activity. Slightly higher confidence but still low malware risk.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.7\n\n- **Assessment:** No malicious patterns; obfuscation likely just for concealment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar cryptographic functions, standard prime generation, primality testing, obfuscated names. No malicious activity detected.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.8\n\n- **Assessment:** No evidence of malware; obfuscation possibly higher but still superficial.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Summary:** Same pattern: cryptographic prime generation, primality testing, obfuscated code, no malicious behavior.\n\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, obfuscated=0.7\n\n---\n\n**Overall observations:**\n\n- **Code content:** All reports correctly identify that the code implements RSA-related cryptographic routines, including GCD, Miller-Rabin primality testing, and prime generation. No network, file, or system modification code is present.\n\n- **Obfuscation:** The variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, but the core logic is standard cryptographic code, not malicious.\n\n- **Malware:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is consistent with the code's content.\n\n- **Risk score:** The risk scores are low (0.2), which seems reasonable given the code's cryptographic purpose and lack of malicious patterns.\n\n- **Scores consistency:** The scores across reports are consistent and justified.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0.7 (obfuscation is superficial but present)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (low, standard cryptographic utility)\n\n### My own estimates:\n\nGiven the detailed review, I agree with the provided scores. The code is a standard cryptographic utility with superficial obfuscation, no malicious behavior, and low security risk.\n\n**Therefore:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.7\n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\n**Conclusion:** The code is benign, primarily serving cryptographic functions, with obfuscation likely intended to hinder reverse engineering but not malicious intent.",
