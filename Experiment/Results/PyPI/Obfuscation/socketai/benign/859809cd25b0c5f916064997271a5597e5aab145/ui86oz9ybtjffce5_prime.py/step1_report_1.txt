{
  "purpose": "This code appears to implement RSA-related cryptographic functions, including prime generation, primality testing, and GCD calculations, likely for key generation or cryptographic operations.",
  "sources": "Reads input data primarily from function parameters such as 'number', 'AKQNoFEGhkHzAcdPsbPFnCIuKMICrAPU', and 'nbits'. Uses 'rsa.randnum' for random number generation, and 'rsa.common' for primality testing.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks such as network communication, file operations, or system modifications are present in the code.",
  "flows": "Random number generation ('rsa.randnum') flows into primality testing and RSA key generation functions. No data flows into external systems or sensitive data outputs.",
  "anomalies": "Code includes obfuscated variable and function names, but uses standard cryptographic operations. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns identified. The code is primarily a standard implementation of RSA prime generation and primality testing.",
  "analysis": "The code implements GCD computation, RSA key size selection, primality testing with Miller-Rabin, and random prime generation. It uses established cryptographic functions from the 'rsa' library. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful system modifications. The obfuscation appears to be superficial, with non-descriptive variable names. Overall, the code serves a typical cryptographic purpose without evident malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard RSA utility for prime generation and testing, with no signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. It appears to be a legitimate cryptographic implementation, albeit with obfuscated naming. No security risks or malware are detected based on this analysis.",
