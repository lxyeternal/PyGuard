The current malware score of 0 and low risk score are justified. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the code is safe for use, and scores are consistent with its functionality."

      "conclusion": "The code is benign ASN.1 schema definitions for cryptographic data with obfuscated class names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is noted but not malicious, and overall risk is very low."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate cryptographic utility, with obfuscation that raises suspicion but no evidence of malicious activity. The scores should reflect low malware risk (0.0), moderate obfuscation (around 0.7), and low overall security risk (around 0.2)."

      "conclusion": "The code is primarily cryptographic utility functions with significant obfuscation. No direct evidence of malicious behavior such as network activity or data theft is present. However, the high level of obfuscation and suspicious module names suggest potential concealment. Further review of external modules and the overall application context is recommended before deployment."

      "conclusion": "The code is likely benign, serving as a placeholder or template with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or active security risks in this fragment. The high obfuscation warrants caution and further review of the complete codebase, but based solely on this snippet, the security risk is minimal."
