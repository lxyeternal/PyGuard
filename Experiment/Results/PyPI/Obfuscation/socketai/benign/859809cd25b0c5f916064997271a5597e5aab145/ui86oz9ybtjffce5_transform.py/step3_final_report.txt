  "purpose": "Utility functions for converting between bytes and unsigned integers, with optional fill size.",
  "sources": "Input data: raw_bytes parameter in from_bytes, number parameter in to_bytes.",
  "sinks": "No external sinks; data is processed in-memory without external output or network activity.",
  "flows": "raw_bytes -> int.from_bytes; number -> number.to_bytes -> bytes; no external data flow or leakage.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable and function names; no malicious or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides straightforward utility functions for byte-integer conversions, with input validation for non-negative integers. The obfuscated naming is superficial and does not impact functionality or security. No external data sources or sinks are present, and the code performs standard operations without malicious payloads or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as utility functions with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident. The obfuscation appears intentional but not malicious. The overall security posture is very low risk.",
