  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check their conclusions, and assess the scores assigned.\n\n1. **Report 1**\n   - **Issues present?** No. The report indicates only a basic RSA implementation with no suspicious activity.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** The report is consistent and cautious, noting high confidence (0.8), and no signs of obfuscation or malware.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. These seem reasonable given the description. The risk score is low but acknowledges a slight inherent risk in cryptographic code.\n   \n2. **Report 2**\n   - **Issues present?** No. Similar to Report 1, it describes a straightforward RSA core.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** The report is consistent, with high confidence (0.9). No suspicious code or behavior is identified.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. These are appropriate.\n\n3. **Report 3**\n   - **Issues present?** No. It again describes a standard RSA implementation.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** The analysis is consistent with previous reports, high confidence (0.8). No signs of malicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2. Appropriate.\n\n4. **Report 4**\n   - **Issues present?** No. The description confirms a typical RSA core.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** The report is consistent, high confidence (0.9). No suspicious activity.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. Since no vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors are detected, zero risk is justified.\n\n5. **Report 5**\n   - **Issues present?** No. Similar to others, straightforward RSA math.\n   - **Errors or flaws?** Consistent, high confidence (0.9). No anomalies.\n   - **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.0. Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports indicate no malicious activity, which aligns with the descriptions.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are zero, matching the straightforward mathematical nature.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.2) in the first three reports, possibly reflecting the inherent risks in cryptographic code, but it is reasonable given the context. The last two reports assign zero, which is also justifiable.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n\n- The scores are consistent with the descriptions.\n- Given the information, the overall malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n- The risk scores could be uniformly set at 0.1–0.2, reflecting the inherent cryptographic complexity but no evident vulnerabilities.\n\n### My estimated scores:\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1 (a minimal inherent risk in cryptographic code, but no active vulnerabilities)\n\n**Conclusion:** The reports are thorough and consistent. No evidence suggests malicious intent or obfuscation. The low risk scores are appropriate, considering the nature of cryptographic implementations.",
