{
  "purpose": "The code provides a core mathematical implementation of RSA encryption/decryption based solely on integer operations.",
  "sources": "Input data is not explicitly read; the code operates on provided integers representing keys and messages.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks, network activity, or data leaks are present in the description.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input integers (keys/messages) through mathematical functions to output results; no external data flow or untrusted source-to-sink paths are indicated.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious code patterns are described; the implementation appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as a straightforward RSA core implementation, focusing on integer mathematics without external I/O or suspicious behavior. All reports confirm the absence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or security flaws. The high confidence levels and zero malware scores across reports support this. The risk scores are low (~0.2), reflecting minimal inherent risk in cryptographic core code, but acknowledging potential misuse if keys are weak. No contradictions or issues are identified, and the scores are consistent with the description.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard, non-malicious implementation of RSA mathematics with no suspicious features. The security risk is minimal, and the likelihood of malicious intent is negligible. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
