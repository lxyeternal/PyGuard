  "purpose": "Implementation of core RSA cryptographic algorithm based on mathematical operations on integers.",
  "sources": "Input data likely includes integers for encryption/decryption, possibly key components.",
  "sinks": "Potential output of encrypted or decrypted data, or key material; no external data sinks indicated.",
  "flows": "Input integers (plaintext, ciphertext, keys) flow through mathematical functions to produce output data.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no unusual code constructs, no suspicious data handling observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements RSA operations using pure mathematical functions, consistent with standard cryptographic practice. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious data flows, or suspicious behavior such as network activity, backdoors, or secret exfiltration. The description suggests it's a straightforward mathematical implementation of RSA, which by itself is not malicious. Without additional context or auxiliary code, there are no anomalies indicating malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard RSA implementation focused solely on mathematical operations on integers. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks detected. It is a normal cryptographic core module.",
