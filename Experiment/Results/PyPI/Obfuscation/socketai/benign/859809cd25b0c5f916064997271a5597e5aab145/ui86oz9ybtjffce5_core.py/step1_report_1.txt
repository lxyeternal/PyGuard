{
  "purpose": "Implement RSA cryptographic algorithm for encrypting and decrypting messages using mathematical operations on integers.",
  "sources": "No explicit input reading code; likely functions expecting parameters such as messages or keys.",
  "sinks": "No direct data output or network communication in the provided snippet; possibly return values or external function calls.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (e.g., message, keys) flow through encryption/decryption functions, but no external untrusted data sources or data sinks are explicitly visible.",
  "anomalies": "The description suggests only a basic mathematical implementation without I/O or network operations. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code implements core RSA functionality, which involves mathematical operations on integers. There are no signs of data leakage, network activity, or malicious behavior. The description does not indicate any obfuscation or hidden code. Since only the mathematical basis is provided, no malicious intent or security risks are evident. The implementation appears standard and intended for cryptographic purposes without malicious modifications.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided description and typical RSA implementation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical implementation of RSA, with no suspicious or malicious activity detected.",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "obfuscated": 0,
