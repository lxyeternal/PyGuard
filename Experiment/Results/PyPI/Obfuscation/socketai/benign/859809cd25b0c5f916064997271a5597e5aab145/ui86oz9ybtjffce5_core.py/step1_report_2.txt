  "purpose": "Implementation of core RSA cryptographic algorithm based on integer mathematics",
  "sources": "No input sources identified; code appears to be a mathematical implementation without external data inputs",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data leaks; no network, file, or environment interactions observed",
  "flows": "Mathematical operations on integers; no data flow from external sources to external outputs",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious constructs; code appears straightforward and focused on mathematical RSA operations",
  "analysis": "The code implements RSA's core functions using integer mathematics, likely including key generation, encryption, and decryption. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors. The implementation seems standard for a mathematical RSA algorithm. No obfuscated code, suspicious dynamic code execution, or abnormal constructs are present. The code’s purpose is solely cryptographic computation based on integers, with no external dependencies or environment variable usage.",
  "conclusion": "The provided RSA implementation appears to be a standard mathematical library for RSA cryptography without malicious intent. There are no indicators of malicious behavior, supply chain attack, or security risks within this code fragment.",
