  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code's content, the reasoning, and the scores assigned.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a core RSA implementation based solely on mathematical operations on integers.\n- No external data sources, sinks, or network activity are identified.\n- No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious code patterns are mentioned.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.8 to 0.9), and malware scores are zero across all reports.\n- Security risk scores are low (0.2 or zero), consistent with the absence of suspicious activity.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations & Validations:\n\n**1. Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n- The reports do not indicate any actual code snippets, only descriptions.\n- Based on the descriptions, the code appears to be a straightforward implementation of RSA's core mathematical functions.\n- **Conclusion:** No issues or malicious behaviors are evident; the code seems correct and standard.\n\n**2. Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n- The reasoning in each report is consistent and cautious, emphasizing the mathematical nature and lack of suspicious activity.\n- No logical flaws or contradictions are apparent.\n- The scores assigned (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 or 0) are reasonable given the descriptions.\n\n**3. Scores Justification & Adjustments:**\n- Malware scores are zero, which aligns with the absence of malicious activity.\n- Obfuscated scores are zero, consistent with the straightforward descriptions.\n- Security risk scores are low, reflecting the low likelihood of security issues based on the provided info.\n- The confidence levels are high, given the detailed reasoning.\n\n**4. Risk and Malware Scores:**\n- Since the code is purely mathematical and there's no indication of malicious intent, the malware score should remain at 0.\n- The risk score, while low, could be slightly increased if the RSA implementation is used improperly (e.g., with weak keys), but based solely on the core implementation, a low risk (0.2) seems appropriate.\n- The scores are consistent across reports.\n\n---\n\n### Final Assessment:\n\n**Malware Score:**  \n- Should remain at **0**, as there's no evidence of malicious code or behavior.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**  \n- Should remain at **0**, as the code appears straightforward without obfuscation.\n\n**Risk Score:**  \n- Given the nature of RSA core math, the risk is minimal but not zero (e.g., improper key management could introduce vulnerabilities).  \n- The current scores (0.2) are reasonable; perhaps slightly higher (e.g., 0.3) if considering potential misuse, but not necessary based on the info.\n\n**Confidence:**  \n- High confidence (0.8–0.9) is justified given the descriptions.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n- **Maintain** the malware and obfuscated scores at **0**.\n- **Keep** the security risk score low (around 0.2–0.3), reflecting the low inherent risk of the core RSA math.\n- **Overall estimate:**  \n  - **Malware:** 0  \n  - **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  - **Risk:** 0.2–0.3\n\nThis aligns with the evidence and reasoning provided. No further modifications are necessary unless additional code or context indicates otherwise.",
