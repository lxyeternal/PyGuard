  "purpose": "Implementation of core RSA cryptographic algorithm based on mathematical properties of integers.",
  "sources": "Potential input points could be variables or functions that accept data or parameters; however, based on the provided snippet, no explicit input sources are visible.",
  "sinks": "Potentially sensitive operations could include key generation, encryption, or decryption functions; specific sinks are not detailed in the snippet, but mathematical operations could be misused if combined with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flow would typically involve input parameters to RSA functions and their processing, but no explicit data flow is observable from the provided code snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, hardcoded secrets, or malicious behavior are evident in the provided description. The code appears to be a straightforward mathematical implementation of RSA, with no signs of obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious modifications.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as the core RSA implementation, which is inherently mathematical and based on integer operations. It does not show signs of malicious activity such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscation. There are no suspicious data sources or sinks evident from the snippet, and no anomalies like hardcoded credentials or malicious code. Since only the description is provided, and not actual code, the evaluation is limited, but based on this, the code appears to be a standard mathematical RSA implementation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard RSA core implementation focused on integer mathematics, with no visible malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided description. There are no signs of malware, obfuscation, or malicious data flows.",
