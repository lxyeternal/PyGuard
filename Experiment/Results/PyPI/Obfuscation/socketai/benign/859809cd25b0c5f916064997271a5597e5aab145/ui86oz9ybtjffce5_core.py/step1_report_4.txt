{
  "purpose": "Implementation of core RSA algorithm based on mathematical properties of integers.",
  "sources": "Mathematical functions and input parameters related to RSA key generation and encryption/decryption processes.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks such as network transmission, file writing, or sensitive data exposure observed in provided snippet.",
  "flows": "Input data (keys, messages) are processed mathematically within functions; no external data flow or network communication identified.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious code patterns detected. The code appears to implement standard RSA mathematics.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward implementation of RSA, focusing on number theory operations such as modular exponentiation, GCD, and key generation. No indications of malicious activities like data exfiltration, backdoors, or unauthorized system access are present. The comments suggest it is a mathematical core, not a complete system. There are no suspicious behaviors, hidden functions, or obfuscated segments. The code aligns with expected RSA implementation practices. Without additional context or external interactions, it does not exhibit malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided RSA core implementation appears to be a legitimate, standard mathematical implementation with no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. It is a foundational cryptographic component, not a malicious or suspicious module.",
