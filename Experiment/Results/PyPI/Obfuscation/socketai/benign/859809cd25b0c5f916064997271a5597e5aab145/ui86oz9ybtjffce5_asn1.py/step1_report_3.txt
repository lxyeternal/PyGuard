  "purpose": "Define ASN.1 data structures for cryptographic key and identifier components",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code defines data structure classes without data input handling",
  "sinks": "None; no data is processed or outputted within this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flow, as classes are only definitions without execution logic",
  "anomalies": "Class and attribute names are obfuscated, which could be suspicious, but may be intentional. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious code behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pyasn1 library and defines ASN.1 sequence classes for identifiers, headers, and RSA key parameters, which are typical in cryptographic contexts. The naming is intentionally obfuscated, possibly to hide intent, but the structure appears to model standard cryptographic data, such as object identifiers, headers, and RSA key components. There are no input or output operations, network activity, or code execution. No suspicious functions, data leaks, or malicious behaviors are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines ASN.1 data structure classes used in cryptographic protocols. The obfuscated names might raise suspicion, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this fragment.",
