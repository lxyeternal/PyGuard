{
  "purpose": "The code defines ASN.1 data structures using the pyasn1 library, likely for encoding/decoding cryptographic or protocol data.",
  "sources": "Class definitions that create ASN.1 structures; no external data input observed within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external outputs; only static class definitions are present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flows or untrusted data handling; the code only declares data formats.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior detected. All classes are straightforward ASN.1 structure definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up ASN.1 structure classes with named fields, including object identifiers, null parameters, octet strings, and integers. No external data, user input, or network operations are present. No obfuscation or malicious constructs are evident. The code appears to serve as data schema definitions for cryptographic objects, such as public keys or certificates.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard, benign setup for ASN.1 data serialization, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
