  "purpose": "Defines ASN.1 data structures for cryptographic identifiers, headers, keys, and RSA parameters using pyasn1.",
  "sources": "Static class definitions, no external input or dynamic data processing.",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static schema definitions without data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no apparent anomalies beyond naming.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of ASN.1 schema definitions for cryptographic data, with obfuscated naming but no executable, network, or data processing behavior. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or malicious code are evident. The obfuscation is likely for code protection or auto-generation, not malicious intent. Scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, risk≈0.1, obfuscated≈0.7) are consistent with the static, benign nature of the code. Given the absence of active behavior or vulnerabilities, the overall security risk is minimal.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign ASN.1 schema definitions for cryptographic data with obfuscated class names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is noted but not malicious, and overall risk is very low.",
