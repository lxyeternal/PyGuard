  "conclusion": "The code is benign ASN.1 schema definitions for cryptographic data with obfuscated class names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The current scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is noted but not malicious, and overall risk is very low."
