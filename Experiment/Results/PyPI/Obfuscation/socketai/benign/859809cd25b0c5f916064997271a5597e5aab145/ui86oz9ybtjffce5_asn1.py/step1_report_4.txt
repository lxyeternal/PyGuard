  "purpose": "Define ASN.1 data structures for cryptographic keys and identifiers.",
  "sources": "Imports from pyasn1.type for ASN.1 types.",
  "sinks": "None; no data output or external communication present.",
  "flows": "Data structures define how data should be formatted but do not process data flow dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, no obfuscated code, no suspicious tags or unusual data handling.",
  "analysis": "The code defines ASN.1 data structures using pyasn1 for cryptographic purposes, including sequences for identifiers, headers, keys, and RSA parameters. No external input handling, network communication, or data processing occurs. The code appears to be standard ASN.1 schema definitions, with properly used types and tagging. No signs of malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors are detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward ASN.1 schema definition for cryptographic data structures. It poses no security risk or malicious intent based on the provided content.",
