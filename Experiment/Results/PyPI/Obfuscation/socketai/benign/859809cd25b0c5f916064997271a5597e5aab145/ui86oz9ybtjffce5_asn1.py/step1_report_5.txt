{
  "purpose": "The code defines ASN.1 data structures related to cryptographic keys and identifiers, likely for encoding or decoding security tokens or certificates.",
  "sources": "Data sources are the ASN.1 sequences and their fields, such as 'oid', 'parameters', 'header', 'key', 'modulus', and 'publicExponent'.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include serialization/deserialization of key data, which could be misused if manipulated maliciously, but no direct network or system interactions are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from ASN.1 input fields through sequence structures, potentially used for cryptographic operations or data exchange, but no explicit data flow to external systems is shown.",
  "anomalies": "All classes are straightforward ASN.1 structure definitions; no hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or unusual constructs are present. No suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code solely contains class definitions for ASN.1 data structures, involving sequences, object identifiers, octet strings, and integers. These structures are typical in cryptographic protocols for encoding keys and identifiers. There are no functions, network calls, or data manipulations that could indicate malicious activity. The subtype tagging and structure naming follow standard practices without hidden or obfuscated logic. No signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or backdoors are apparent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard set of ASN.1 structure definitions for cryptographic elements. It shows no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be part of a larger cryptographic system or protocol implementation.",
