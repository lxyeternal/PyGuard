{
  "purpose": "Defines ASN.1 data structures related to cryptographic keys and identifiers using the pyasn1 library.",
  "sources": "The code does not read input or external data; it only defines data structures.",
  "sinks": "No sinks that process untrusted data or lead to data leaks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines schemas.",
  "anomalies": "The class and variable names appear obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual for standard cryptographic code but not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code uses pyasn1 to define ASN.1 data structures: sequences with named types for cryptographic identifiers and RSA parameters. No input/output operations, network connections, or data processing are present. The obfuscated class names are unusual but do not imply malicious intent; they may be a result of obfuscation or automated code generation. There are no signs of malware, backdoors, or security issues. The code appears to be standard ASN.1 schema definitions for cryptographic data.",
  "conclusion": "The code solely defines ASN.1 data structures without performing any data processing or external interactions. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident based on this snippet.",
