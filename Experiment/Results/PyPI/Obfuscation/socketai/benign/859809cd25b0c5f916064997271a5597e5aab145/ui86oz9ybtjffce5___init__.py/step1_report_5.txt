{
  "purpose": "Module for calculating large primes, and RSA encryption, decryption, signing and verification, including key generation.",
  "sources": "Reads input data for plaintext, keys, or signatures; generates large primes and keys; possibly reads user-provided data for cryptographic operations.",
  "sinks": "Performs encryption, decryption, signing, verification; potential output of encrypted or signed data; possibly logs or exposes sensitive information.",
  "flows": "Input data (plaintext, keys) -> cryptographic functions (encrypt, decrypt, sign, verify) -> output data; key generation flow includes prime calculations and key storage.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of security enhancements such as compression or padding; no mention of secure random number generation; warning indicates insecure implementation; no explicit hardcoded secrets noted, but implementation details are missing.",
  "analysis": "The code is described as a basic RSA cryptography module with prime calculations and key management. The warning highlights that it does not implement common security practices like message compression, padding, or other countermeasures, which can lead to vulnerabilities such as plaintext repetitions and susceptibility to certain cryptographic attacks. No explicit malicious behavior is evident from the description; however, the insecure practices and lack of security measures suggest the implementation is weak and potentially vulnerable if used in production. The code could potentially leak sensitive data if improperly handled but does not appear to contain malicious intent or backdoors based on the description provided.",
  "conclusion": "The module provides fundamental RSA cryptography functions but omits critical security features, making it insecure for production use. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, but its insecure design could be exploited if used as-is. Caution is advised, and secure cryptographic practices should be employed for any real security needs.",
