  "purpose": "Module for large prime calculations and RSA cryptographic operations including key generation, signing, verification, encryption, and decryption.",
  "sources": "Input data for key generation, message signing, verification, encryption, and decryption functions.",
  "sinks": "Output of cryptographic results; no untrusted data flows to external systems or network connections.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters through cryptographic functions to output results; no suspicious source-to-sink paths identified.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of padding, compression, or security enhancements; no obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code implements standard RSA cryptography with no malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious network activity. The absence of security features like padding or compression is a known security flaw but not malicious. No anomalies such as obfuscated code or hardcoded secrets are present. The malware score is justified as 0, reflecting no malicious intent. The security risk score is elevated due to insecure defaults, ranging from 0.3 to 0.6 across reports, which is consistent with the acknowledged security limitations. Confidence in these assessments is high (0.8+), given the thorough review and absence of suspicious signals.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic RSA implementation with significant security shortcomings but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is not detected, and the security risk is moderate due to insecure practices. The reports' scores are justified and consistent with the observed code behavior.",
