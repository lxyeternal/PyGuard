{
  "purpose": "This module provides functionality for calculating large prime numbers, performing RSA encryption, decryption, signing, and verification, and generating RSA key pairs.",
  "sources": "Inputs likely come from user functions or external data passed into encryption/signing functions, such as plaintext messages, keys, or random data for key generation.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include cryptographic operations, key storage, and any network communication or file I/O for transmitting or storing encrypted data or signatures.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (plaintext, keys, random seed) through prime calculation and key generation functions, then into encryption/signature functions, potentially towards output (encrypted data, signatures, keys).",
  "anomalies": "The code explicitly states that it does not use compression or other security improvements, which is a security concern but not necessarily anomalous code behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious loops are evident from the description.",
  "analysis": "The description indicates the module implements RSA cryptography, including prime generation and key management. No malicious behavior is explicitly stated or implied, but the lack of security enhancements suggests potential risks if used improperly. Without the actual source code, it's not possible to identify hidden malicious code, but based on the description, there are no obvious malicious constructs. The warning about insecure implementation suggests that the code may be vulnerable to cryptographic attacks if used improperly but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The module appears to be a standard implementation of RSA cryptography without security best practices, which is a security risk but not malicious per se. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or harmful code, but the insecure design warrants caution. Overall, the code is not malware but should be used carefully due to security deficiencies.",
