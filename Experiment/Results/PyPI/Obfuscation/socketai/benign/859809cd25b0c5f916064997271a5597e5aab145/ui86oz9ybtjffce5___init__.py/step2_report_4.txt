  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and potential malicious behavior.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe a cryptographic module implementing RSA and large prime calculations.\n- Commonly, they mention the absence of security best practices such as padding, compression, or other protections.\n- No evidence of obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs is noted.\n- Malware scores are consistently zero, aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- Security risks are elevated primarily due to insecure implementation, not malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 1**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Consistent with a standard RSA module.\n- **Anomalies:** No explicit anomalies beyond insecure defaults.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; primarily insecure implementation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.4, Confidence = 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** The score of 0.4 for security risk seems reasonable given the known security limitations. Malware remains 0, which is justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 2**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar to Report 1.\n- **Anomalies:** No security features like padding; no malicious signs.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity; insecure defaults.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.3, Confidence = 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly lower security risk score aligns with the description. Malware remains 0, justified.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 3**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Consistent with RSA operations.\n- **Anomalies:** No suspicious code, just security limitations.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious activity detected.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.3, Confidence = 0.9.\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score is consistent; malware remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 4**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar RSA functionality.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious code; insecure practices noted.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malicious intent.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.6, Confidence = 0.8.\n\n**Assessment:** Slightly higher security risk due to more explicit mention of insecure practices. Malware score remains justified at 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Report 5**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Same general purpose.\n- **Anomalies:** No malicious behavior; insecure implementation.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No malicious intent; security weaknesses.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, SecurityRisk = 0.5, Confidence = 0.7.\n\n**Assessment:** The security risk score reflects the insecure design; malware remains 0.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary & Final Recommendations**\n\n- **Malware scores:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there is no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All are 0, consistent with no obfuscation observed.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Scores range from 0.3 to 0.6, reflecting the known security limitations. These are reasonable given the descriptions.\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **SecurityRisk:** Approximately 0.5 — balancing the consistent mention of insecure practices with no malicious intent.\n\n**Conclusion:** The scores assigned in the reports are reasonable and consistent with the described code behavior. The primary concern is insecure implementation, not malicious activity. No adjustments are necessary based on the provided information.",
