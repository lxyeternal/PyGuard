  "conclusion": "The code is a basic RSA implementation with significant security shortcomings but no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is not detected, and the security risk is moderate due to insecure practices. The reports' scores are justified and consistent with the observed code behavior."
