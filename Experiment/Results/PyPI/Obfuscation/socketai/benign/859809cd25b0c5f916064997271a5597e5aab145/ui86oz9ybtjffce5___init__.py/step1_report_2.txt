  "purpose": "This module provides functions for calculating large primes, RSA encryption, decryption, signing, verification, and key generation.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters for cryptographic operations, such as plaintext, keys, or messages.",
  "sinks": "Outputs encrypted/decrypted messages, signatures, or verification results; potential leaks if handling sensitive data insecurely.",
  "flows": "Input data flows into cryptographic functions; outputs are produced after processing. No evidence of untrusted data being sent over network or stored without controls.",
  "anomalies": "Lack of security features like padding schemes, encryption modes, or protection against common cryptographic vulnerabilities. No hardcoded credentials or obvious backdoors. Warning about security limitations indicates awareness but not malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs fundamental RSA cryptography operations. It explicitly states that it does not implement security best practices such as input compression, padding, or resistance to repetition attacks. No obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or suspicious constructs identified. The design appears to be a straightforward implementation of RSA without malicious intent, but the omission of security measures could lead to insecure usage. No evidence of data exfiltration, network communication, or backdoors detected. The code's purpose is cryptography, not malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This module implements RSA cryptography with an explicit warning about its security limitations. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage. Its security risks are due to incomplete security features rather than malicious intent. Usage in security-sensitive environments should be carefully reconsidered, but the code itself appears benign.",
