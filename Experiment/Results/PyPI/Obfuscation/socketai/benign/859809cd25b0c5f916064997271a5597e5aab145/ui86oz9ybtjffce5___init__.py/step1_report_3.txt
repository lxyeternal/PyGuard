{
  "purpose": "This module provides functionality for calculating large prime numbers, and performing RSA encryption, decryption, signing, and verification. It also includes key generation capabilities.",
  "sources": "It reads input data during encryption, decryption, signing, verification, and key generation processes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include the handling of untrusted input data for cryptographic operations, especially if keys or plaintext are supplied externally, but no direct malicious data leaks are evident.",
  "flows": "Input data (plaintext, keys) are processed through prime calculations, RSA operations, and signing/verification functions; no explicit data flow to external systems is indicated.",
  "anomalies": "The code explicitly states that it does not implement security improvements such as compression of the plaintext to prevent repetitions, which is a security concern but not malicious per se. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are apparent. The warning suggests awareness of security limitations rather than malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The module is designed for cryptographic operations involving large primes and RSA. No suspicious code constructs, obfuscated code, or malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or hidden backdoors are observed. The warning about security deficiencies indicates the implementer’s awareness but does not imply malicious intent. The code appears to perform standard cryptographic functions, with a noted security caveat about plaintext handling. No malicious signals or malware patterns are detected. The overall structure is consistent with legitimate cryptographic tooling, but the lack of security best practices could be exploited if misused, though this does not constitute malicious behavior in the code itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard cryptographic module for RSA and large prime calculations with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The primary concern is its security limitations, not malicious activity.",
