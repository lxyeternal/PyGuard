  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the presence or absence of issues, and assess the scoring and conclusions.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Consistent with the code's purpose. No suspicious data flows or leaks identified.\n- **Anomalies:** No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code; security limitations acknowledged.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** The report correctly states that the module is a straightforward RSA implementation with security shortcomings but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0 — aligns with no malicious behavior.\n  - obfuscated: 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n  - securityRisk: 0.4 — reasonable given insecure defaults.\n  - confidence: 0.8 — appropriate.\n\n**Verdict:** The report is accurate; no issues here.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Standard cryptographic functions, no suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Lack of padding/encryption modes, security features missing, but no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies security limitations but no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0 — consistent.\n  - obfuscated: 0.\n  - securityRisk: 0.3 — reasonable.\n  - confidence: 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** Accurate and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Same as above; no suspicious activity.\n- **Anomalies:** Security features missing, but no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Appropriately notes security issues but no malicious intent.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0.\n  - obfuscated: 0.\n  - securityRisk: 0.3.\n  - confidence: 0.9.\n\n**Verdict:** Well-aligned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Standard RSA operations, no suspicious data leaks.\n- **Anomalies:** No security improvements, but no malicious code.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly identifies insecure implementation, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0.\n  - obfuscated: 0.\n  - securityRisk: 0.6 — slightly higher, justified due to security risks.\n  - confidence: 0.8.\n\n**Verdict:** Reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Flows:** Consistent with the module's purpose.\n- **Anomalies:** No mention of malicious code, just insecure practices.\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** Correctly states the lack of security features, no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:**\n  - malware: 0.\n  - obfuscated: 0.\n  - securityRisk: 0.5 — justified given insecure implementation.\n  - confidence: 0.7.\n\n**Verdict:** Appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- **Obfuscated:** All 0, consistent with no obfuscation observed.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.6, justified by the lack of padding, compression, and other security measures.\n- **Confidence:** High, given the detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- The reports are consistent and accurate.\n- The main concern is the insecure implementation, not malicious intent.\n- The scores reflect this appropriately.\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0 — no evidence of malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 — no obfuscation observed.\n- **Risk score:** 0.5 — balanced between the security shortcomings and the absence of malicious activity.\n\n**Summary:** The code is a basic RSA module with significant security deficiencies but no malicious behavior. The reports are well-reasoned and appropriately scored.",
