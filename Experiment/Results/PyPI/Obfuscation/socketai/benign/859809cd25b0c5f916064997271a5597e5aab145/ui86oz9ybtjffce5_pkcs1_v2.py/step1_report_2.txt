{
  "purpose": "Generate a hash-based output of specified length using a seed and a hash function, primarily for cryptographic or key derivation purposes.",
  "sources": "Reads the seed parameter, the 'length' parameter, and the optional 'oswLWDDVfYkpmoHBxCbKULtvltetTbAZ' (hash algorithm name).",
  "sinks": "Uses pkcs1.compute_hash, which processes data for hashing; no direct data leaks or external data sinks are apparent.",
  "flows": "The seed and hash function name are used to generate a hash digest, which is then expanded to the desired length via multiple hash computations.",
  "anomalies": "The function dynamically selects hash algorithms, which is typical; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. The doctest block appears unrelated but is harmless.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a function that derives a byte string of specified length by hashing seed + incremental values using a selected hash function. It validates the hash function name against known methods, raises exceptions for invalid inputs, and constructs the output by repeated hashing. The only external library used is 'rsa', specifically 'pkcs1' and 'transform'. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or sabotage. The code appears to implement a standard KDF-like process. The doctest loop at the end is a testing artifact and does not impact security. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a standard cryptographic hash-based key derivation function without malicious intent. It is free from malware indicators, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behavior. The overall security risk is low, with no evident supply chain threat or malware signs.",
