  "purpose": "Module setting up sensor data classes and constants, primarily import/export declarations.",
  "sources": "Import statements, especially the obfuscated import aliases and the version string.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this fragment.",
  "flows": "Import aliases and constants are loaded; no data flow or processing evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated-looking import aliases (e.g., eFmAftFAfSrGevXrvGERjbhpiUejhYeq, KXWcsUjauvEuPFhMrFWKvbHNyYNMmnaa), which are unusual and suspicious but could be auto-generated.",
  "analysis": "The code is a static module with no executable logic, network activity, or data leaks. The obfuscated import names are suspicious but may be artifacts of code generation or obfuscation techniques. No malicious behavior or active threats are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0.0, obfuscated=0.4-0.7, risk=0.2) are consistent with this assessment. The primary concern is the obfuscation, which warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Further review of the imported modules' content is recommended to ensure they are benign.",
  "conclusion": "Based on this fragment, there is no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscated identifiers are suspicious but not definitive. The overall security risk is low, but the obfuscation should be monitored. The scores are appropriate; no changes are necessary unless further context reveals malicious behavior.",
