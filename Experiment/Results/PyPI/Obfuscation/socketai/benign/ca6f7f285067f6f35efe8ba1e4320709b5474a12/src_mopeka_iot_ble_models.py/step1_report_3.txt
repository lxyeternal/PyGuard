  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration for various types of water and fuel-related substances with associated string labels.",
  "sources": "No external data sources; static enum definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no untrusted data processing or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines static enum members.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name and variable names, but they do not perform any malicious actions; all strings are benign labels.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward enum class with obfuscated naming, possibly to obscure intent or for anti-analysis measures. No input handling, no data leakage, no network calls, no code injection, or other suspicious behavior detected. The structure is consistent with a standard enum definition in Python. The obfuscated names do not indicate malicious behavior but could be for concealment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enum class with no malicious intent or security risks detected. The obfuscation appears to be for naming concealment rather than malicious purposes.",
