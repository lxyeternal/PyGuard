  "purpose": "A Python Enum class defining various resource type constants with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Class definition and enum members; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data flows; static code with no external interactions.",
  "flows": "N/A; static enum members without data flow or external data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names; no malicious code or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward static Enum with resource labels as string literals. Obfuscated names are present but do not indicate malicious intent. No external data, network activity, or dynamic code execution is observed. The code's simplicity and benign content suggest no vulnerabilities or malicious behavior. Scores assigned in reports (malware=0, securityRisk≈0.1, obfuscated≈0.7-0.8) are consistent with the code's nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated enumeration of resource types with no evidence of malware or security risks. Obfuscation is notable but not malicious. The current scoring and assessments are justified and accurate.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
