  "purpose": "Update README documentation with supported Python versions and current Python version based on JSON data.",
  "sources": "Reads 'python_versions.json' for version data; reads 'README.rst' for content; uses regex to modify content.",
  "sinks": "Writes updated content back to 'README.rst'. No untrusted data sinks or network activity present.",
  "flows": "Loads JSON -> Parses versions -> Finds max version -> Reads README -> Applies regex replacements -> Writes back to README.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Regex usage is standard and controlled.",
  "analysis": "The code performs straightforward file I/O, JSON parsing, version comparison, and regex string replacements. No signs of malicious activity, obfuscation, or external data exfiltration. Minor security considerations regarding regex manipulation are acknowledged but do not constitute actual threats given the code's scope.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign utility for updating documentation with version info. No malware, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are present. The low risk scores in the reports are justified; the overall assessment confirms the code's safety.",
