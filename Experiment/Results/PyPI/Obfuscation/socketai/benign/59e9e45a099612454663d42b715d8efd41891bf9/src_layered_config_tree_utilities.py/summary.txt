  "conclusion": "The utility code appears safe and standard for YAML loading with validation. The only concern is the obfuscated parameter name, which warrants further review in the actual implementation. No evidence of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities is present based on the provided documentation. The scores are appropriate; malware is unlikely, but the obfuscated name justifies a cautious obfuscated score. Overall, the code is considered safe, with a recommendation to review the actual code for any hidden malicious logic, especially regarding loader safety and parameter naming."
