  "purpose": "Utility functions for loading and parsing YAML content within the layered_config_tree package.",
  "sources": "The YAML content is read from a file path or string input; no external untrusted data sources explicitly referenced.",
  "sinks": "Loading YAML data into a Python dictionary, which could potentially lead to code execution if malicious YAML is processed (e.g., YAML tags that instantiate code).",
  "flows": "Input (file path or string) -> YAML parsing -> Dictionary output; no explicit use of untrusted input in dangerous ways beyond standard YAML loading.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected. The YAML loading logic appears standard and safe.",
  "analysis": "The code is primarily concerned with loading YAML content from a file or string, with validation for duplicate keys and error handling. There is no indication of malicious code, backdoors, or data exfiltration. YAML parsing can be risky if unsafe loader options are used, but this is not explicitly indicated. No use of network, system commands, or environment variables is observed.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard utility for YAML loading with appropriate error handling. There are no signs of malicious intent or security risks based on the provided fragment.",
