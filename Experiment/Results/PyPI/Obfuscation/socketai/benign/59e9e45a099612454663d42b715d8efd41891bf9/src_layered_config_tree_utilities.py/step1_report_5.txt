  "purpose": "Provide utility functions for loading and parsing YAML content in the layered_config_tree package.",
  "sources": "YAML content input (`qWiGDHWrHQxHCeFBzdRtmCqiIRjLMmej`), file path inputs, environment variables (not explicitly shown but potentially if used elsewhere).",
  "sinks": "Parsing functions that convert YAML content into a dictionary, potential exceptions raised (ValueError, DuplicateKeysInYAMLError).",
  "flows": "Input data (string or file path) -> YAML loading functions -> parsed dictionary or error.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated logic, no dynamic code execution or network operations.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard YAML loader with appropriate checks for file type and duplicate keys, raising specific errors for invalid data or duplicate keys. There is no evidence of code injection, malicious data handling, or suspicious behavior. The focus is on data validation and error handling. The description is thorough but does not include any actual implementation details or potentially risky operations.",
  "conclusion": "This module provides standard utility functions for YAML processing with proper validation and error handling. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks in the described code.",
