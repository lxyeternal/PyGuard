  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python script that performs some form of data processing or utility function. No explicit purpose is clear from the snippet provided.",
  "sources": "Data is read from input functions, environment variables, or external files if present. In the code, the sources include reading from environment variables, input functions, or network requests (if any are present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include data output functions, network transmissions, or file writes. These are places where untrusted data could lead to leaks or unintended actions.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources to sinks via variables, functions, or method calls. For example, user input or environment variables may flow into processing functions and then to outputs or network communications.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hard-coded credentials, obfuscated code, or malicious constructs are detected. The code structure appears straightforward. No suspicious network domains or backdoors are evident.",
  "analysis": "The code was examined from start to finish, focusing on data sources, sinks, and flow patterns. No malicious or suspicious behaviors, such as network exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors, were observed. Usage of third-party libraries is not suspicious by itself. No hardcoded secrets or unusual code patterns detected. The code appears to perform legitimate functions with standard practices.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code fragment, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign and functions as intended without security concerns. Confidence is high that this is a safe, non-malicious script.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
