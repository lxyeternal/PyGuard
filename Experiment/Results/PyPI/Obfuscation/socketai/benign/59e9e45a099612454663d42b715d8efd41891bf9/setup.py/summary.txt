  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of exec(), which should be trusted in a controlled environment. Malware score is 0, obfuscation score is moderate (~0.5), and overall security risk is low (~0.3). The assigned scores in the reports are justified and appropriate."
