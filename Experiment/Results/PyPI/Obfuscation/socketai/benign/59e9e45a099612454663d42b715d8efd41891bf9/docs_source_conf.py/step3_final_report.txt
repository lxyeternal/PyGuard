  "purpose": "Minimal header script with only shebang and encoding declaration, serving as a placeholder or template.",
  "sources": "No data sources; code contains only comments.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flows; no executable logic or data processing present.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of any executable code, functions, or data handling; purely boilerplate comments.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a shebang and encoding comment, with no operational logic, data sources, sinks, or flows. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. The code is trivial and serves as a placeholder, with no security risks or obfuscation. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all appropriately zero, and confidence is high given the simplicity and clarity of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, minimal, and non-malicious. The reports correctly identify the lack of any security concerns or malicious activity. No modifications are necessary; the current assessment and scoring are accurate.",
  "confidence": 1,
