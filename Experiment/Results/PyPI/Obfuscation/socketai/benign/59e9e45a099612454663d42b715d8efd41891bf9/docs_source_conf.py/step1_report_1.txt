{
  "purpose": "No purpose is explicitly defined; the code only contains a shebang and a coding declaration without functional content.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data output, processing, or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow or logic flow can be identified due to absence of executable code.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of only shebang and encoding comment with no functional code; no suspicious or unusual code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal, consisting solely of a shebang line indicating the interpreter and a comment specifying UTF-8 encoding. There are no functions, classes, variables, data handling, or control structures. As such, there is no executable logic, data flow, or potential security concern evident within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code contains no operational logic or behavior; it is essentially an empty script with only metadata comments. No malicious activity or security risks are present in this fragment.",
