  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks, focusing on supply chain threats, code obfuscation, and malicious indicators.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, external library imports, network connections, hardcoded strings, eval()/exec() usage.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, environment variable reading, potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input flow into network calls, eval()/exec(), or file operations, potentially leading to malicious actions.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscation signs, hardcoded credentials, eval()/exec() usage, suspicious URLs/IPs, missing or empty code snippets, inconsistent or overly suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code snippets generally show benign patterns with no suspicious activity, except for report 2 which indicates signs of malicious intent such as obfuscation, eval()/exec(), hardcoded strings, and suspicious network activity. The other reports are either empty, minimal, or standard, with scores reflecting low risk. The high suspicion in report 2 is justified if such patterns are confirmed; otherwise, scores should be adjusted downward. Overall, the scoring aligns with the described evidence, with report 2 warranting high malware and obfuscation scores, and the rest indicating low risk.",
  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; report 2 shows signs of malicious behavior justified by its indicators. The overall supply chain risk is low, with a notable exception in report 2. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary unless further code details contradict the suspicion.",
