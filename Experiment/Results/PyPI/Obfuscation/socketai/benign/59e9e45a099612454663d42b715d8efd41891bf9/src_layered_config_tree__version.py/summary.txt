  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risk; report 2 shows signs of malicious behavior justified by its indicators. The overall supply chain risk is low, with a notable exception in report 2. Scores are consistent with the evidence, and no adjustments are necessary unless further code details contradict the suspicion."
