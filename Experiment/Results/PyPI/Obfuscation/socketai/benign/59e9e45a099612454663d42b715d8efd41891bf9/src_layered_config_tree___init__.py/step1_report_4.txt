  "anomalies": "The code is empty, contains no executable statements, and has no comments or structure; this is unusual and suggests either an incomplete snippet or a placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code provided is entirely empty, with no content, functions, or logic. Without code, there is no behavior to analyze for malicious activity or security risks. The absence of code itself is atypical but does not indicate malicious intent. It might be a placeholder or an incomplete snippet.",
  "conclusion": "There is no executable code to evaluate for malicious behavior or security issues. The provided snippet is empty and does not pose any security risk. Further code content is needed for a meaningful assessment.",
