{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing or utility functions, but without specific context or comments, the exact purpose cannot be conclusively determined.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from function inputs, environment variables, and possibly external files or network sources (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system commands, file writes, network communication, or database operations, especially if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (e.g., environment variables, function arguments) through processing functions, potentially reaching sinks such as system calls or network sockets.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated code or unusual language features are detected. The code does not perform suspicious operations such as network communications or file manipulations without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, with clear functions and standard library usage. No malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or system damage routines, is evident. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent. The absence of external network calls or system modifications reduces suspicion. Overall, the code appears to be benign and typical for its intended utility.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code looks legitimate and does not contain any malicious patterns or suspicious activities.",
