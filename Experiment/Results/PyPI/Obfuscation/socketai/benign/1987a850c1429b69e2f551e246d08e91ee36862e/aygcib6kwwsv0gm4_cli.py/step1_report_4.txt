  "purpose": "This script provides command-line interface functionality for copying, pasting, and clearing clipboard contents using the pyperclip3 library.",
  "sources": "Reads input from sys.argv via argparse parsing, and reads clipboard content through pyperclip3's buffer.read() in the 'copy' command.",
  "sinks": "Writes to sys.argv commands, clipboard via pyperclip3 functions, and outputs to stdout or stderr.",
  "flows": "User command input (via argparse) triggers clipboard operations through function calls that read from sys.argv and perform clipboard read/write/clear actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated function names, variable names, and imported module functions (e.g., cHuvhYCUCSNtUQZVAQLHknnojHgdReCR), which could hide malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, but the obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The script imports standard libraries and an external library (pyperclip3). It defines an obfuscated function that handles clipboard commands ('copy', 'paste', 'clear') based on user input. The command execution involves reading from stdin and writing to clipboard or stdout. The code structure appears to implement a simple CLI clipboard utility. However, the use of heavily obfuscated function and variable names, along with importing multiple functions from an obscure module, suggests potential malicious obfuscation. The logic itself is consistent with legitimate clipboard operations but the obfuscation warrants suspicion. No evident malicious network activity, hardcoded credentials, or data leaks are present.\n",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to implement a basic clipboard utility with obfuscated identifiers. While it does not directly exhibit malicious behavior such as network communication or data exfiltration, the heavy obfuscation and unconventional naming raise suspicion of potential malicious intent or hidden backdoors. The overall risk is moderate due to obfuscation but lacks direct malicious actions.",
