  "purpose": "Clipboard CLI utility performing copy, paste, and clear operations based on CLI commands, using an obfuscated 'pyperclip3' library.",
  "sources": "Reads from stdin buffer for 'copy' command; uses 'pyperclip3' functions; command-line arguments for operation mode.",
  "sinks": "Writes to stdout buffer for 'paste'; uses 'pyperclip3' functions; error messages to stderr.",
  "flows": "Input data from stdin → 'copy' command → 'pyperclip3' buffer; 'paste' command → output buffer; command-line args determine flow path.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; import from non-standard 'pyperclip3' library; lack of error handling; potential concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a CLI for clipboard operations with obfuscated identifiers and an unusual import. No network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for concealment. The use of 'pyperclip3' is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The logic is straightforward and aligns with typical clipboard utilities. Scores assigned in reports (malware: 0-0.2, obfuscated: 0.3-0.7, risk: 0.2-0.4) are justified given the obfuscation level but lack of malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, obfuscated clipboard utility with no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the obfuscation and non-standard library, which warrant cautious scoring but do not confirm malicious intent.",
