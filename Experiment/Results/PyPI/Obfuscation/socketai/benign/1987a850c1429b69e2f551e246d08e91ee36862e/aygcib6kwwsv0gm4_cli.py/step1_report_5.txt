  "purpose": "A command-line utility for copying, pasting, and clearing clipboard contents using the pyperclip3 library.",
  "sources": "User inputs are the command arguments parsed via argparse, and clipboard data read via sys.stdin or from the clipboard.",
  "sinks": "Clipboard write/read operations, and standard output for errors or content display.",
  "flows": "Input command (copy/paste/clear) -> function execution -> clipboard operations or printing errors.",
  "anomalies": "Use of highly obfuscated variable and function names, importing specific functions from a potentially non-standard library 'pyperclip3', and dynamic command execution based on parsed arguments. The code does not handle errors robustly, and the import statements may be suspicious if the library is altered or malicious. The code reads from stdin and clipboard, but does not sanitize data.",
  "analysis": "The script provides clipboard management functions, which are common in utility scripts. Obfuscated variable names and the non-standard import 'pyperclip3' are suspicious, suggesting possible concealment or malicious intent. The core functionality (copy, paste, clear) is typical, but the obfuscation and dynamic nature increase risk. The code does not perform any network operations, system modifications, or suspicious data exfiltration directly. However, the obfuscation and import source require further validation to rule out malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a clipboard utility with obfuscated identifiers and non-standard library usage. While its primary functions are benign, the obfuscation and unusual import raise concerns about potential malicious intent or concealment. Additional context or source verification of 'pyperclip3' is recommended before deployment.",
