  "conclusion": "The code appears primarily benign clipboard utility code with platform-specific implementations. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The main security concern is the use of subprocess calls with untrusted data, which could lead to command injection if misused. No malware or backdoors are detected. The security risk score of 0.3 appropriately reflects this moderate concern. The obfuscation score of 0.7 in some classes is justified due to the naming obscurity. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants input validation if used in untrusted contexts."
