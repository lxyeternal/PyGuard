  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a suspicious pattern of obfuscated import and immediate invocation, typical of malicious or backdoor scripts. The high obfuscation and pattern suggest a potential threat, and further investigation into the 'cli' module is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this code. The malware score is set at 0.7, obfuscation at 0.85, and overall security risk at 0.75 to reflect the suspicion level."
