  "purpose": "Import and invoke an obfuscated symbol from a local module, potentially executing malicious code.",
  "sources": "Import statement from .cli module, the symbol ENSezfHSqpuLrNOnmmmchtnKGZXVMcVy, and its immediate invocation.",
  "sinks": "The invoked symbol could execute code that affects system integrity, data, or network, depending on its implementation.",
  "flows": "Import from .cli -> immediate call of ENSezfHSqpuLrNOnmmmchtnKGZXVMcVy()",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated symbol name, immediate invocation without validation, no parameters, no context about the symbol's behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a highly obfuscated symbol from a local module and calls it immediately, which is a pattern often associated with malicious or obfuscated code designed to hide intent. The suspicious pattern is consistent across multiple reports, with high obfuscation scores and suspicion of malicious behavior. Without inspecting the 'cli' module or the symbol's implementation, definitive maliciousness cannot be confirmed, but the pattern warrants caution. The malware score should be elevated to reflect the obfuscation and immediate invocation pattern, which are common in malicious scripts. The overall security risk is moderate to high, given the pattern, but not definitive without further analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits a suspicious pattern of obfuscated import and immediate invocation, typical of malicious or backdoor scripts. The high obfuscation and pattern suggest a potential threat, and further investigation into the 'cli' module is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this code. The malware score is set at 0.7, obfuscation at 0.85, and overall security risk at 0.75 to reflect the suspicion level.",
