{
  "purpose": "Import and instantiate a class or function named 'ENSezfHSqpuLrNOnmmmchtnKGZXVMcVy' from a local module '.cli'.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing from '.cli'; instantiation of 'ENSezfHSqpuLrNOnmmmchtnKGZXVMcVy'.",
  "sinks": "Instantiation of the class or function potentially executing code upon creation, but no explicit sink for untrusted data is present.",
  "flows": "Import statement loads code; instantiation executes the constructor or function, which may perform internal operations. No data flows from external sources explicitly shown.",
  "anomalies": "The class/function name appears obfuscated, which may indicate concealment or malicious intent. The module is local, reducing external input risk but raising suspicion due to obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a seemingly obfuscated class or function from a local module and immediately instantiates it. The naming suggests obfuscation, which is common in malicious scripts to hide behavior. There are no visible external data sources, network calls, or sensitive data access. The obfuscated name and immediate instantiation warrant caution, as this pattern can be used to hide malicious behavior executed during object creation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is minimal but suspicious due to the obfuscated naming and immediate instantiation from a local module. While no explicit malicious actions are visible, the obfuscation and pattern are often associated with malicious or hidden behavior. Further analysis of the '.cli' module and the class/function implementation is recommended.",
