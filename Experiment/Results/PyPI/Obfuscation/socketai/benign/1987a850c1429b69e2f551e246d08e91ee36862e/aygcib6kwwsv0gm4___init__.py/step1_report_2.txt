{
  "purpose": "The code provides wrapper functions for clipboard operations, including copy, clear, and a custom method, relying on an imported utility object.",
  "sources": "Import statements (modules util and base), instantiation of KPHmWZSfAqsWZMWjegoITFKyzvuBIUKp, and function arguments.",
  "sinks": "Clipboard operation methods called on LSLSZLPqjYWeMJtUkwAlGpJeGIMNrVhD: copy, cHuvhYCUCSNtUQZVAQLHknnojHgdReCR, and clear.",
  "flows": "Data flows from function arguments into clipboard methods. Initialization flow involves creating the utility object. If initialization fails, an exception is raised.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable names; no visible hardcoded secrets or credentials. No network activity or system modifications observed. The code is straightforward wrapper logic with exception handling.",
  "analysis": "The script imports internal modules and attempts to instantiate a clipboard utility object. If instantiation fails, it raises an exception. The three functions (copy, cHuvhYCUCSNtUQZVAQLHknnojHgdReCR, clear) check if the utility object is initialized; if not, they raise an exception. These functions invoke corresponding methods on the utility object with provided arguments. No network activity, obfuscation, or malicious logic is present. The variable names are intentionally obscure but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code appears to be a simple wrapper around clipboard functionalities with exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward, obfuscated wrapper for clipboard operations with proper error handling. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or suspicious activities are evident. The obfuscation seems to serve to hinder easy understanding but does not indicate malicious intent.",
