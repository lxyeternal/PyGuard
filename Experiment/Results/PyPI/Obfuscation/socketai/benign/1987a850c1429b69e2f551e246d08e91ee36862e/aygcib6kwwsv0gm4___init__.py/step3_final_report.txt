  "purpose": "Wrapper functions for clipboard operations (copy, clear, get) utilizing an obfuscated clipboard object.",
  "sources": "Imports of util and base modules, instantiation of clipboard object, function parameters.",
  "sinks": "Methods invoked on the clipboard object (copy, clear, custom method cHuvhYCUCSNtUQZVAQLHknnojHgdReCR).",
  "flows": "Parameters passed into wrapper functions flow into clipboard object methods.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names; no malicious code or network activity visible.",
  "analysis": "The code initializes a clipboard utility object with exception handling, then provides wrapper functions that invoke methods on this object. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to hide behavior but does not directly indicate malicious intent. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or destructive actions are evident. The code appears to be a legitimate clipboard utility with obfuscated identifiers, which warrants caution but not necessarily maliciousness.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated wrappers around clipboard functions, with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with low malware likelihood and moderate obfuscation and risk scores. Continued monitoring and analysis of the imported modules are recommended to rule out hidden malicious behavior.",
