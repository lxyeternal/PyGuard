  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated wrappers around clipboard functions, with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with low malware likelihood and moderate obfuscation and risk scores. Continued monitoring and analysis of the imported modules are recommended to rule out hidden malicious behavior."
