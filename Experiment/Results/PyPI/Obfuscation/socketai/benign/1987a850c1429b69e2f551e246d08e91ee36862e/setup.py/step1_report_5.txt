  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, including package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file to include its content as long description.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks occur.",
  "flows": "Read from 'README.md' and pass to setup() as long_description; dependencies are specified but not dynamically fetched.",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical, e.g., zoNnClKuyWcuEcQTIkIOnKZHzCdOCVBh, GKGiXcrfuYntLqYoknVMtqGYaVGcDtUY; unnecessary string concatenation (+ OkWSIaeKHOSbCbMVwzxpBXmYCibMPsUc); inconsistent naming conventions; potential typo in 'tests_require'. Additionally, the line 'OkWSIaeKHOSbCbMVwzxpBXmYCibMPsUc = (+ OkWSIaeKHOSbCbMVwzxpBXmYCibMPsUc)' appears to be a no-op or malformed operation. These signs could suggest obfuscation or code hiding malicious intent, but they are likely just poor coding style or auto-generated code.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard setup tasks: reading a README file, defining dependencies, and calling setuptools.setup() with metadata. The obfuscated variable names and peculiar concatenation line are suspicious but do not perform any malicious actions or contain malicious code. No code injection, data leakage, or suspicious network activity is detected. The dependencies specified are typical for a cross-platform package and do not show signs of malicious payloads. The code does not execute untrusted code or contain hidden backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard Python setup script with obfuscated variable names and minor formatting anomalies. No malicious behavior, malware, or security risks are evident. The anomalies seem to be poor coding practices or auto-generated obfuscation rather than malicious intent.",
