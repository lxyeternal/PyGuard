{
  "purpose": "The code is a Python setup script using setuptools to configure package metadata, dependencies, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' for long description; defines dependencies and entry points; contains obfuscated variable names and redundant code lines.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or network operations; no malicious data handling or code execution points identified.",
  "flows": "Input from 'README.md' into description variable; static setup configuration; no data flow leading to untrusted sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, superficial string concatenation, inconsistent formatting, and strange code snippets like 'OkWSIaeKHOSbCbMVwzxpBXmYCibMPsUc = (+ OkWSIaeKHOSbCbMVwzxpBXmYCibMPsUc)'.",
  "analysis": "The script performs standard package setup with superficial obfuscation. No malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration is present. Obfuscation appears auto-generated or stylistic, not malicious. The anomalous code lines do not impact functionality but suggest superficial obfuscation. Dependency declarations are standard. The code's intent is benign, and no security vulnerabilities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation is superficial and likely stylistic or auto-generated. The malware score is 0, obfuscation moderate (~0.5), and security risk low (~0.2). The code is safe for use, but obfuscation warrants cautious review if encountered in other contexts.",
