  "purpose": "Setuptools package setup configuration for a Python project, including dependencies, metadata, and entry points.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "None explicitly present; no untrusted data being executed or sent over network.",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, e.g., 'zoNnClKuyWcuEcQTIkIOnKZHzCdOCVBh' for dependencies, and 'dWfUsHiWESDxmkOUYDSUJTdZDgdmPiVM' for filename, which are unusual and could be attempts to hide malicious intent. The 'read' operation on 'README.md' is standard and harmless. No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script using setuptools, with obfuscated variable names that don't add functionality or security. The dependencies listed are standard for testing and platform-specific requirements. The obfuscation could be suspicious, but no malicious behavior such as network activity, file modifications, or code execution is evident. No signs of malicious payloads or backdoors. The strange variable names may be to evade static detection, but the logic appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a standard package setup with obfuscated variable names. No malicious code, backdoors, or malicious behavior detected. The obfuscation is suspicious but not necessarily malicious.",
