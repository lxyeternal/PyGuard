  "conclusion": "The code is a typical, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation is superficial and likely stylistic or auto-generated. The malware score is 0, obfuscation moderate (~0.5), and security risk low (~0.2). The code is safe for use, but obfuscation warrants cautious review if encountered in other contexts."
