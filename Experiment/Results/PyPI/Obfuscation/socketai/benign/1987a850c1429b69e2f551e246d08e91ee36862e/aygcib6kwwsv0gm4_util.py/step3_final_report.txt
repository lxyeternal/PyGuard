  "purpose": "Platform-specific clipboard module dispatcher that imports and returns platform-dependent clipboard handling functions or classes.",
  "sources": "sys.platform check determines platform; imports modules based on platform; no external input or data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks; no network, file, or environment variable operations; only conditional imports and function calls.",
  "flows": "Platform detection -> conditional import -> return of platform-specific clipboard handler.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated module and function names; no explicit malicious code or network activity; straightforward platform dispatch logic.",
  "analysis": "The code detects the operating system via sys.platform and imports platform-specific modules with obfuscated names, returning their functions or classes. No hardcoded credentials, network activity, or malicious code are present. The obfuscation of identifiers is notable but not inherently suspicious. All reports correctly identify the pattern and assign low malware risk (0), with obfuscation scores reflecting the obfuscated names (around 0.7-0.8). Confidence levels are high, given the simplicity and clarity of the logic. The overall security risk remains very low, with scores around 0.2, acknowledging the obfuscation but no evidence of malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate platform dispatcher for clipboard modules, with obfuscated identifiers that do not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the low security risk score is justified. Obfuscation warrants cautious review of imported modules, but no immediate threats are evident.",
