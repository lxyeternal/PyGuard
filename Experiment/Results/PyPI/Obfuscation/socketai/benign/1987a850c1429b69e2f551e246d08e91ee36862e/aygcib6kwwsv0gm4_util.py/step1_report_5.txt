  "purpose": "Select and import platform-specific clipboard handling functions based on the current operating system.",
  "sources": "sys.platform for OS detection; import statements for platform-specific modules.",
  "sinks": "Return statements that invoke platform-specific functions; no direct data sinks present.",
  "flows": "Detection of platform via sys.platform -> dynamic import of platform-specific clipboard module -> function call returning clipboard handler.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic imports based on platform is normal; no hardcoded secrets, no obfuscated code, no suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code checks the current OS using sys.platform. Depending on the platform, it imports a specific module and returns an object or function from that module. The else clause raises an exception if the platform is unsupported. No hardcoded credentials, no network activity, no suspicious code patterns. The code appears to be straightforward platform detection and module loading for clipboard operations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a platform-based dispatcher for clipboard handling functions. It does not contain malicious behavior or suspicious code. The logic is clear and standard for cross-platform clipboard access.",
