      "conclusion": "The code is a typical, obfuscated setup script with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation is superficial and likely stylistic or auto-generated. The malware score is 0, obfuscation moderate (~0.5), and security risk low (~0.2). The code is safe for use, but obfuscation warrants cautious review if encountered in other contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign clipboard utility with significant obfuscation and some implementation bugs. It does not contain malware or malicious intent. However, insecure handling of input data in subprocess calls poses a security risk if used with untrusted inputs. Fixing variable references, adding input sanitization, and de-obfuscating code would improve security and maintainability."

      "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated wrappers around clipboard functions, with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with low malware likelihood and moderate obfuscation and risk scores. Continued monitoring and analysis of the imported modules are recommended to rule out hidden malicious behavior."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "This code is a skeleton with heavily obfuscated class and method names, serving as an interface or base class. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. The overall security risk is low, but continued vigilance is recommended if integrated into larger, obfuscated codebases."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, clipboard utility library. There are no signs of malware or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the overall security risk is low. It could be misused in malicious contexts, but in isolation, it seems benign."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a legitimate platform dispatcher for clipboard modules, with obfuscated identifiers that do not indicate malicious behavior. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the low security risk score is justified. Obfuscation warrants cautious review of imported modules, but no immediate threats are evident."

      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code exhibits a suspicious pattern of obfuscated import and immediate invocation, typical of malicious or backdoor scripts. The high obfuscation and pattern suggest a potential threat, and further investigation into the 'cli' module is strongly recommended before trusting or deploying this code. The malware score is set at 0.7, obfuscation at 0.85, and overall security risk at 0.75 to reflect the suspicion level."

      "confidence": 0.85,
      "conclusion": "The code appears primarily benign clipboard utility code with platform-specific implementations. Obfuscation is present but not malicious. The main security concern is the use of subprocess calls with untrusted data, which could lead to command injection if misused. No malware or backdoors are detected. The security risk score of 0.3 appropriately reflects this moderate concern. The obfuscation score of 0.7 in some classes is justified due to the naming obscurity. Overall, the code is low risk but warrants input validation if used in untrusted contexts."
