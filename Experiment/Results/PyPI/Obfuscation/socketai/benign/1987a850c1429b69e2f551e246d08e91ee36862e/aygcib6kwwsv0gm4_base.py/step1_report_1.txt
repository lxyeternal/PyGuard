  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and an abstract base class for data copying and clearing operations.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources; potential data inputs are via method parameters in subclasses.",
  "sinks": "Potential data handling occurs in the abstract methods, but implementations are not provided.",
  "flows": "Method parameters suggest data may flow from external sources into the class implementations, but no concrete flow is visible.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names, which could be an attempt to hide purpose. No actual malicious code or secrets detected. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two custom exception classes and an abstract class with three abstract methods, which are placeholders for copying, processing, and clearing data. No implementation is provided, limiting the ability to detect malicious behavior. The obfuscated class names are suspicious but not necessarily malicious; they could be a result of code obfuscation or code generation. There are no signs of data leaks, backdoors, or malicious network activity. The code structure is typical for defining interfaces and custom exceptions, with no dangerous operations evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard abstract class and exception definitions with obfuscated class names. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive proof of malicious behavior.",
