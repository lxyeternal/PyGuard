{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and an abstract base class for data copying and clearing operations.",
  "sources": "No explicit data sources; class definitions with no input reading.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs that handle untrusted input or sensitive data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; methods are abstract and not implemented.",
  "anomalies": "Use of abstract methods with placeholder implementations; no concrete code or data handling; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code defines custom exception subclasses and an abstract class with method signatures for copying data, processing data, and clearing data. There are no concrete implementations, data processing, or I/O operations. No malicious behaviors such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system manipulation are present. The code appears to be a standard interface definition with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "This source code is a straightforward interface definition for data handling with no signs of malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation. It appears to be a non-functional skeleton meant for extension.",
