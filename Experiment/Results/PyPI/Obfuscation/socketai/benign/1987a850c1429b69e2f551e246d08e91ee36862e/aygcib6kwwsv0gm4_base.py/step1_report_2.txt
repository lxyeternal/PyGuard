  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes and an abstract base class for file or data handling operations.",
  "sources": "No data input sources; only class and method definitions.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; methods are abstract with no implementation.",
  "flows": "No data flows observed, as methods are unimplemented.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class and method names, which may indicate intentional concealment; no actual implementation present; no hardcoded secrets, credentials, or suspicious external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two exception classes with obfuscated names inheriting from Exception, and an abstract base class with method signatures for copying data, processing data, and clearing internal state. All methods are abstract and contain no logic. The obfuscated naming could be a red flag but might also be an attempt at obscurity without malicious intent. There are no data sources, sinks, or external communications, and no code execution or data manipulation occurs in this fragment. No indicators of malicious behavior, backdoors, or supply chain attacks are present within this limited code.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a structure defining exceptions and an interface with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, security risks, or suspicious activities. The obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent but warrants caution if found in a larger context.",
