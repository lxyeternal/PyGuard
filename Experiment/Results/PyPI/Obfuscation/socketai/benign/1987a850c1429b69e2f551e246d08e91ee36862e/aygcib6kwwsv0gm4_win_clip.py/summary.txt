  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, albeit obfuscated, clipboard utility library. There are no signs of malware or malicious payloads. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but the overall security risk is low. It could be misused in malicious contexts, but in isolation, it seems benign."
