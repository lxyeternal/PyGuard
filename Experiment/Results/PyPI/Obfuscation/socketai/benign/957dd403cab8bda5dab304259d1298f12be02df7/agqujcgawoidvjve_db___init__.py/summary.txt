  "conclusion": "The analyzed code shows some obfuscation and suspicious data flows but no definitive malicious behavior. The scores accurately reflect the low likelihood of malware presence, with moderate concern due to obfuscation. The absence of code in other reports justifies zero risk scores. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears acceptable with cautious monitoring recommended."
