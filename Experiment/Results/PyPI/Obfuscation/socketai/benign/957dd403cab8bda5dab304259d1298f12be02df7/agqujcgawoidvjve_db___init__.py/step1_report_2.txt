  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors detected in the provided code snippet.",
  "analysis": "The provided code snippet is empty; no code lines are available for analysis. Without code content, it's impossible to identify potential sources, sinks, data flows, or anomalies. Therefore, the review cannot detect any malicious intent or security issues based on the absence of code.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the absence of code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, but a more thorough review requires actual code content.",
