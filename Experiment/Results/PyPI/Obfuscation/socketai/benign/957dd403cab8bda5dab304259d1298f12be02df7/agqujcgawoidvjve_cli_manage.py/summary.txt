  "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the unvalidated dynamic import of user-controlled files, which could be exploited to execute malicious code if malicious settings files are supplied. No evidence of malware or obfuscation exists in the code. The risk score should be increased from 0 to approximately 0.5 to reflect the potential for code execution via untrusted inputs. Obfuscation remains low, and overall malware risk is minimal, but the pattern warrants caution. Implementing input validation and safer import mechanisms is recommended."
