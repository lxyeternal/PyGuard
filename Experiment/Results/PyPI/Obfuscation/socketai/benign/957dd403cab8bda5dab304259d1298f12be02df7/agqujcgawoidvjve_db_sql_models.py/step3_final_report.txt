{
  "purpose": "Static ORM schema definitions with obfuscated class and variable names, containing syntax anomalies in index definitions, but no active malicious behavior.",
  "sources": "Class definitions, column declarations, index statements, __repr__ methods",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or external data sinks identified; no network or system modification code present",
  "flows": "Schema definitions are static; no data flow or code execution paths indicating malicious activity",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and attribute names, malformed index syntax (e.g., 'ihUHblgqcPRhCEeWEchUczIygbPhaCcJ='), inconsistent index parameters",
  "analysis": "The code consists of ORM model classes with heavily obfuscated names and syntax irregularities in index definitions. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. The anomalies are likely artifacts of auto-generation or obfuscation rather than malicious payloads. The static analysis justifies malware score of 0, with moderate obfuscation (0.7) and low to moderate security risk (0.2-0.4). The syntax anomalies could pose runtime issues but do not directly indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated or auto-generated ORM schema definitions with no evidence of active malware or malicious behavior. The anomalies are primarily in naming and syntax, not indicative of malicious sabotage. Scores are consistent with static analysis; further dynamic testing is recommended if deployed.",
