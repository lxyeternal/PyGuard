      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The primary security concern is the unvalidated dynamic import of user-controlled files, which could be exploited to execute malicious code if malicious settings files are supplied. No evidence of malware or obfuscation exists in the code. The risk score should be increased from 0 to approximately 0.5 to reflect the potential for code execution via untrusted inputs. Obfuscation remains low, and overall malware risk is minimal, but the pattern warrants caution. Implementing input validation and safer import mechanisms is recommended."

The scores accurately reflect the low likelihood of malware presence, with moderate concern due to obfuscation. The absence of code in other reports justifies zero risk scores. Overall, the supply chain security posture appears acceptable with cautious monitoring recommended."

Other reports show benign patterns with low scores. The overall assessment aligns with the indicators, and no further adjustments are necessary."

The obfuscation is likely for concealment rather than malicious intent. The primary security consideration is the handling of external inputs for database URLs, which should be validated in a real deployment.

The high obfuscation warrants caution but does not imply malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, assuming external modules are trustworthy. The malware score is 0, obfuscation score is 0.7, and security risk score is approximately 0.2."
