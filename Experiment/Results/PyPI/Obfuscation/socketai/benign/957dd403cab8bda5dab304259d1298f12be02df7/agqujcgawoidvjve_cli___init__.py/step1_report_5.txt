{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed for data processing, possibly related to network or user input handling, but the exact purpose is unclear due to lack of comments and context.",
  "sources": "Input functions such as reading from environment variables, user input prompts, or network requests (if present).",
  "sinks": "Potential data outputs such as writing to files, sending data over network connections, or executing system commands.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources like environment variables or user input through processing functions towards sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of comments makes intent unclear. Look for hardcoded credentials, unusual dynamic code execution, or obfuscated code sections. No such anomalies are evident without further context.",
  "analysis": "The code lacks explicit indicators of malicious behavior. It uses standard Python functions without obfuscated or suspicious patterns. No hardcoded secrets or malicious network activity are apparent. Since the code snippet is missing detailed parts, the review is based on observed structure and common risk indicators.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there are no clear signs of malicious behavior or supply chain security risks. The code appears standard and benign, but the lack of context limits full assurance.",
