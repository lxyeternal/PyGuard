{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a benign data processing utility with no malicious patterns or suspicious behavior.",
  "sources": "The code reads data inputs, processes them, and outputs results; no external or untrusted data sources indicate malicious intent.",
  "sinks": "Output functions and data handling points where untrusted data could potentially leak or cause effects, but none are malicious or suspicious in this context.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources through processing functions to output sinks; no malicious or anomalous source-to-sink paths are identified.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious behaviors detected; code structure appears straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard data processing script with no signs of obfuscation, malicious network activity, or security vulnerabilities. All signals point to benign functionality. The confidence in this assessment is high (0.9), given the lack of suspicious patterns. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code segments are present. The security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting minimal concern. The overall malware and obfuscation scores are zero, consistent with the benign analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is safe, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. The assessment aligns with the provided reports, and no modifications are necessary.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
