  "purpose": "This code appears to be a utility script for data processing, possibly involving file handling and data transformation tasks.",
  "sources": "Reads input data from files or user input via function parameters or input prompts.",
  "sinks": "Writes output to files, prints to console, or returns processed data. No external network activity or system modifications detected.",
  "flows": "Data is read from source inputs, processed through functions or transformations, and then stored or outputted via files or console.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code constructs detected. The code structure appears standard and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code reads data from specified sources, processes it with standard operations, and outputs results. No suspicious or malicious patterns such as obfuscated code, dynamic execution, or unauthorized data access are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is typical for data processing tasks. No signs of malicious behavior like data exfiltration, network communication, or system compromise are present.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign data processing utility with no indications of supply chain sabotage or malware.",
