  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, but without the actual code provided, the purpose cannot be definitively determined.",
  "sources": "Any data sources could include environment variables, input functions, configuration files, or external libraries invoked within the code.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network communication functions, file writing operations, or data serialization methods that could leak data or execute malicious commands.",
  "flows": "Data flow would typically originate from sources like input functions or environment variables, and could reach sinks through function calls, data assignments, or external library usage.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies can be identified without actual code content. Watch for hardcoded credentials, suspicious function calls, or obfuscated code segments.",
  "analysis": "The analysis is limited by the absence of code. No specific security risks or malicious behaviors can be identified without examining code structure, logic, or content. General best practices suggest reviewing for hardcoded secrets, insecure data handling, and suspicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "Due to lack of provided code, a definitive security assessment cannot be performed. No explicit malicious behavior or security risks are apparent from the prompt, but a detailed review of actual code is necessary for conclusive findings.",
