  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, supply chain risks, and security issues.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, user input, files, network inputs, external libraries",
  "sinks": "Network communications, file operations, system calls, data serialization",
  "flows": "Sources such as environment variables or user input to sinks like network or file operations, possibly via dynamic evaluation or string manipulation",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscation, dynamic code execution, suspicious variable naming, hardcoded strings, complex control flow, potential concealment of malicious payloads",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion of obfuscation with complex control flow and dynamic evaluation, which can hide malicious intent. No explicit malicious payloads are identified, but the structure allows for potential malicious activity. The scores assigned (malware: 0.4, obfuscated: 0.7, securityRisk: 0.55) are consistent with the suspicion level. Other reports lacking code are correctly scored with zero or minimal risk. The reasoning aligns with standard security assessment practices, balancing suspicion with the absence of concrete malicious indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The analysis indicates moderate suspicion of malicious behavior primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code features, but no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Further static or dynamic analysis could clarify the intent, but current assessment is justified.",
