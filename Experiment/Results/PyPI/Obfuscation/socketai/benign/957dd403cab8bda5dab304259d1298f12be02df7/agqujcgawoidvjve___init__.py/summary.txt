  "security_risk": 0.55,

  "conclusion": "The analysis indicates moderate suspicion of malicious behavior primarily due to obfuscation and dynamic code features, but no definitive malicious payloads are confirmed. The scores are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. Further static or dynamic analysis could clarify the intent, but current assessment is justified."
