{
  "purpose": "This source code appears to perform data processing or handling tasks, potentially involving network communication or data storage.",
  "sources": "Reads data from environment variables, input functions, or network sources (if any), as well as from external files or modules.",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, databases, or sends data over network connections; also includes logging or print statements.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables, external files) through processing functions to sinks (storage, network, output).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious hardcoded credentials, suspicious network addresses, or obfuscated code segments detected. Code structure appears straightforward without unusual language features.",
  "analysis": "The code has a clear structure with standard Python constructs. No signs of code injection, dynamic code execution, or hidden backdoors. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious imports are present. It does use some standard libraries and handles data in a conventional manner. Absence of network connections or data exfiltration mechanisms reduces risk. The code appears legitimate and free of malicious behavior based on this review.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, with no indications of malicious intent or security risks. It follows normal programming patterns without suspicious anomalies or malicious behaviors.",
