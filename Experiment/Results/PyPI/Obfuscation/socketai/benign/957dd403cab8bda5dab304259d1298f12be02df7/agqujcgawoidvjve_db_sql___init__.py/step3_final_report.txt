{
  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, sabotage, or security risks, focusing on code features such as code injection, data leakage, insecure practices, and obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Input data from environment variables, untrusted user input, external data sources, and code execution functions like eval()/exec().",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file system access, environment variables, and potential data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources such as untrusted input or environment variables through code execution or network functions to sinks like network sockets or file writes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec() with untrusted data, hardcoded secrets, complex or obfuscated code patterns, and suspicious import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits high suspicion if it employs eval()/exec() on untrusted data, contains hardcoded secrets, or shows signs of obfuscation. Benign code lacks these features and follows standard practices. The presence of such suspicious constructs increases malware and security risk scores. Lack of code or benign patterns results in low scores. The scores should reflect the presence of malicious indicators, with high scores (close to 1) for confirmed malicious behavior, and low scores (close to 0) for benign code.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 indicates high likelihood of malicious activity due to eval()/exec() and secrets, warranting high malware (0.7), obfuscation (0.6), and risk (0.8) scores. Other reports show benign patterns with low scores. The overall assessment aligns with the indicators, and no further adjustments are necessary.",
