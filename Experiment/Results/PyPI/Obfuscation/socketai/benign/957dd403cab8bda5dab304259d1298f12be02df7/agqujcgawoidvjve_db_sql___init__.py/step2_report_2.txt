  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the issues, their reasoning, and the scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report states no suspicious or malicious behavior, with a malware score of 0 and a security risk of 0.2. Given the lack of code details, this seems reasonable.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report's reasoning is cautious and acknowledges the limited code context. No errors detected.\n- **Scores:** The malware and obfuscated scores are both 0, consistent with the analysis.\n- **Justification:** The low risk score aligns with the absence of suspicious activity.\n- **Overall:** Sound reasoning and scoring.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report indicates use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, and obfuscation, with high malware (0.7) and security risk (0.8) scores.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The report's reasoning is strong, pointing out specific suspicious constructs. However, the obfuscated score is 0.6, which is high but perhaps slightly overestimating unless code obfuscation techniques are confirmed.\n- **Scores:** The malware score of 0.7 is justified given the potential for malicious code execution. The obfuscated score at 0.6 seems reasonable considering the suspicion.\n- **Justification for risk:** Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data and hardcoded secrets are serious issues, warranting high scores.\n- **Overall:** The reasoning is solid, and the scores reflect the potential severity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** Due to lack of code, the report assigns low scores (malware 0, security risk 0.2), which seems appropriate.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The cautious approach is justified; no issues detected.\n- **Scores:** Consistent with the limited information.\n- **Overall:** Correct.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report indicates benign code with no suspicious patterns, malware 0, security risk 0.2.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The reasoning is sound, given the absence of code details.\n- **Scores:** Appropriate.\n- **Overall:** Well-reasoned.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Issue presence:** The report finds no malicious indicators, no obfuscation, and no suspicious behavior.\n- **Errors or flaws:** The analysis is thorough and cautious, considering the entire code.\n- **Scores:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0.2 are consistent.\n- **Overall:** Justified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary and Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware scores:** Only Report 2 raises concern, justified by eval()/exec() and secrets.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Only Report 2 has a notable obfuscation suspicion; others are zero.\n- **Risk scores:** High for Report 2, low for others, consistent with their findings.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimates:\n\n- **Malware:** 0.7 (matching Report 2) — the use of eval()/exec() on untrusted data is a strong indicator.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.6 (matching Report 2) — suspicion of obfuscation based on complex constructs.\n- **Risk:** 0.7 — considering the potential for malicious code execution and secrets, this is a serious concern.\n\n**Final notes:** The reports are consistent, and the reasoning aligns with the scores. The main concern lies with Report 2, which correctly flags high risk due to suspicious functions and secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type       | Estimated Value | Justification                                              |\n|------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | 0.7               | Use of eval()/exec() on untrusted input, secrets present     |\n| Obfuscated       | 0.6               | Indications of obfuscation, complex code patterns            |\n| Security Risk    | 0.7               | High potential for malicious activity, code execution risks |\n\nProceed with caution regarding the code flagged in Report 2.",
