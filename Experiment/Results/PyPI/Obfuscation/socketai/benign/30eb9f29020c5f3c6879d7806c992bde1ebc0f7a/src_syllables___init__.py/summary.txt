  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a heavily obfuscated linguistic or pattern-matching utility with no evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain security issues. The obfuscation appears stylistic rather than malicious. The malware score is 0, and the overall security risk is very low. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming complexity but does not imply malicious intent."
