{
  "purpose": "The code appears to analyze words, possibly for linguistic or filtering purposes, by matching patterns and counting vowel/consonant patterns.",
  "sources": "Reads the module name using importlib.metadata; processes predefined regex patterns for matching words.",
  "sinks": "Uses regex match objects on input words, potentially on user input, but does not directly write to external systems or leak data.",
  "flows": "The function EUnqqaDVDOYeUvczIqVBDadAdQDiwaaE takes a word, splits it into vowel segments, and matches it against regex patterns; counts matches and returns a score.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, complex pattern lists, and a function name that looks intentionally obscure. No obvious hardcoded credentials or secrets.",
  "analysis": "The script defines a set of regex patterns intended for matching specific word endings or structures, likely for linguistic purposes. It compiles these patterns and uses them to match input words. The function processes the input word, splitting into vowel segments, and counts pattern matches against the word, adjusting a score accordingly. There are no network calls, file writes, or system modifications. The code is highly obfuscated in variable naming but does not exhibit typical malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, command execution, or backdoors.",
  "conclusion": "This code appears to be a linguistic or pattern-matching utility with obfuscated variable names, but it does not contain any malicious behavior or malware. The security risk is very low. The obfuscation seems to be a stylistic choice rather than an attempt to conceal malicious intent.",
