  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. The obfuscation is likely intended to evade simple static scans but does not pose a threat. The overall security risk is low, and the malware score should be set to 0. The obfuscation score can be moderate (~0.6), reflecting superficial obfuscation. The risk score remains low (~0.2), considering the lack of active malicious actions."
