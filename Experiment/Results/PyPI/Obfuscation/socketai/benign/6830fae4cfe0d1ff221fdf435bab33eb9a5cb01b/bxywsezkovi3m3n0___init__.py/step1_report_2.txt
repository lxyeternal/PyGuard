  "purpose": "Import specific functions or objects from a local module 'grouplabelencode_func'",
  "sources": "Import statement reading from a relative module path",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in the given code fragment",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flow observed in this snippet",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers are large, seemingly random strings that resemble obfuscated or maliciously generated names; no context for their purpose is provided",
  "analysis": "The code imports two entities with long, nonsensical names from a relative module. The identifiers appear to be obfuscated or auto-generated, which can sometimes indicate malicious intent or hidden functionality. However, without additional code or context, it is impossible to determine the purpose or malicious nature of these imports. The snippet itself does not exhibit malicious behavior, but the naming warrants caution and further review of the imported module.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs a standard import from a local module, but the obscure, nonsensical names raise suspicion of obfuscation. Further analysis of the 'grouplabelencode_func' module is necessary to confirm safety. Based solely on this fragment, there is no explicit malicious activity observed.",
