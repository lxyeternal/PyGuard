  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from a local module named 'grouplabelencode_func'.",
  "sources": "The import statement reads from a local module within the package, specifically from the relative path '.grouplabelencode_func'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks or data outputs are visible in this snippet; the imported entities are just brought into scope.",
  "flows": "No data flow can be determined from this single import statement alone; no functions are called or data processed.",
  "anomalies": "Imported names 'bGwBdPjPjNEqQcMSacnBcLEKDXwXWYGm' and 'DJGRnkKKESXAwRYqPaODPlOAYlywFndf' are non-descriptive, likely obfuscated or autogenerated, which could indicate malicious intent or code obfuscation.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs an import operation from a local module. The imported identifiers are complex and non-meaningful, which is suspicious as it may suggest obfuscation or attempts to hide malicious code. Without additional context or code execution, there's no evidence of malicious behavior at this point. However, the naming conventions and the nature of the import raise suspicion that this could be part of a larger obfuscated or malicious codebase.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious behavior but uses obfuscated names, which warrants caution. The import style and naming suggest possible code concealment or preparation for malicious activities in subsequent code sections.",
