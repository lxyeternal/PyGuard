  "purpose": "Importing specific functions or classes from a local module for further use.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module '.grouplabelencode_func'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data sinks or untrusted data handling observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statement likely used for later function calls or data processing within the module.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers 'bGwBdPjPjNEqQcMSacnBcLEKDXwXWYGm' and 'DJGRnkKKESXAwRYqPaODPlOAYlywFndf' appear as obfuscated, nonsensical names, which may indicate intentional obfuscation or malicious concealment. The import of two objects with such obscure names from a local module warrants further review.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single import statement that pulls in two entities with highly obfuscated names from a local module. Obfuscated identifiers can sometimes be used to hide malicious functionality or backdoors, but in isolation, this code does not demonstrate malicious behavior. Without additional context, it's unclear whether these imported components perform harmful actions. The lack of any other code or comments prevents definitive conclusions, but the obfuscated names should prompt further inspection of 'grouplabelencode_func' for malicious or suspicious code.",
  "conclusion": "The import statement itself is not inherently malicious; however, the use of obfuscated identifiers suggests potential concealment. This warrants further review of the 'grouplabelencode_func' module to verify the behavior of the imported functions or classes and ensure they do not perform malicious activities.",
