{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific functions from a local module, likely used for further processing within a larger program.",
  "sources": "Import statement sourcing functions from a relative module 'grouplabelencode_func'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data flows to external systems or outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the imported functions within the local module to where they are used in the larger codebase, but no direct flows are visible here.",
  "anomalies": "The function names 'bGwBdPjPjNEqQcMSacnBcLEKDXwXWYGm' and 'DJGRnkKKESXAwRYqPaODPlOAYlywFndf' appear to be obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains an import statement with obfuscated function names, suggesting an attempt to conceal functionality. No other code, data handling, or malicious behavior is present in this snippet. Obfuscated identifiers could be used to hide malicious intent or avoid detection, but based solely on this import statement, there is no definitive malicious activity. Additional context is needed to determine if these functions perform malicious actions.",
  "conclusion": "This minimal code snippet with obfuscated import names raises suspicion due to the lack of clarity and context, but no direct malicious behavior can be confirmed from this alone. The use of obfuscated identifiers warrants further review of the imported functions for malicious content.",
