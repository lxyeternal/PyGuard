  "purpose": "Import obfuscated functions from a local module, likely for internal use.",
  "sources": "The import statement from .grouplabelencode_func, importing two functions with obfuscated names.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external data flows are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No runtime data flow; only static import of functions with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated, nonsensical identifiers for imported functions, which is suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple import from a local module with obfuscated function names, which raises suspicion of concealment. No malicious activity, data leakage, or external communication is evident in this snippet. The obfuscation suggests potential concealment but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores assigned in reports (malware: 0, obfuscated: ~0.8, security risk: ~0.3, confidence: ~0.5) are consistent with this assessment. Further review of the 'grouplabelencode_func' module is recommended to determine the nature of these functions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious due to obfuscated identifiers but does not demonstrate malicious behavior in isolation. The current scores are appropriate; the obfuscation warrants further investigation but does not confirm malicious activity.",
