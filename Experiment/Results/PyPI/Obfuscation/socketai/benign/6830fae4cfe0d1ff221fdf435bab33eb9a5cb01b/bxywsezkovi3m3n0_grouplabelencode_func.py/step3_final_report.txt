{
  "purpose": "The code performs data transformation based on provided mappings and encodings, primarily manipulating lists and dictionaries with heavily obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Input lists and mappings, which are read during iteration and processing within the functions.",
  "sinks": "The code does not contain explicit sinks such as network calls, file operations, or system modifications; it processes data internally.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input lists/dictionaries through iteration and conditional checks, resulting in transformed lists based on mappings and encodings.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names and lack of comments; no external system interactions or malicious code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of functions performing data transformation tasks, including mapping and encoding. The obfuscation makes understanding difficult, but no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or system modification are evident. The functions operate solely on provided data structures, with no suspicious operations. The malware score is appropriately zero, and the high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming. The low security risk score is justified given the benign data processing, though the obfuscation warrants cautious review in security-sensitive contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data transformation utility with heavy obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity or sabotage is detected. The high obfuscation level suggests caution but does not indicate malicious intent based on the available code fragment.",
