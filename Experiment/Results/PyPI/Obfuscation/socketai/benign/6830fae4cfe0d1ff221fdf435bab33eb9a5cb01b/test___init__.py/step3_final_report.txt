  "purpose": "The code appears to be benign, typical data processing or utility functions with no suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, standard input/output, data processing functions",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks via environment variables or logs, external network calls if present",
  "flows": "Input sources such as environment variables or user input flow into processing functions, with no evidence of malicious data exfiltration or harmful actions",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; code is straightforward with no obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is minimal or standard in nature, with no suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious indicators. Confidence is high (0.9), malware likelihood is negligible (0), and security risk is low (0.2). The code does not exhibit any malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. The assessments are consistent across reports, and no adjustments are necessary.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippets and analysis, there is no evidence of malicious activity or significant security risks. The code is benign, with no obfuscation or malware detected, and the low security risk score is appropriate. The overall confidence in this assessment is high.",
