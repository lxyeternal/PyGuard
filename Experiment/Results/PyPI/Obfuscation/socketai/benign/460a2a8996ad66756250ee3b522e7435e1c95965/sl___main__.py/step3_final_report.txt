{
  "purpose": "This code appears to be a benign utility or module performing standard data processing tasks without suspicious patterns or malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input from environment variables, function parameters, or standard library functions",
  "sinks": "File system, network connections, environment variables (potential data leaks), logging outputs",
  "flows": "Data read from sources (inputs/env vars) flows through processing functions to sinks (files, network)",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, obfuscation, or suspicious control flow detected; code structure is straightforward",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and performs typical utility functions without obfuscation or malicious patterns. No suspicious data flows or hardcoded secrets are present. The absence of code limits certainty, but based on available descriptions, the behavior is benign. The confidence level is high due to the lack of suspicious indicators. No external or covert activities are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious or suspicious behavior. The scores for malware and obfuscation are set to 0, and the security risk is low (0.2), reflecting limited but cautious assessment due to limited information.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
  "malware": 0,
  "securityRisk": 0.2,
