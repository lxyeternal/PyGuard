  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be a utility or module designed to perform specific operations, but the exact function is unclear without additional context.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from user input, environment variables, and possibly external modules or files.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include network connections, file operations, or system commands, which could be exploited if untrusted data is involved.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input sources (user/env/file) to sinks like network or file system, possibly passing through intermediate processing steps.",
  "anomalies": "There are no obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious dynamic execution. The code structure and language features are straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code's structure shows standard Python functions and modules usage. No signs of malicious logic like network connections, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries is benign. No obfuscated code, unusual variable naming, or hidden payloads detected. Input handling appears normal, and there are no dangerous system calls or insecure patterns observed.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. The code appears to be a benign utility module with no harmful intent.",
