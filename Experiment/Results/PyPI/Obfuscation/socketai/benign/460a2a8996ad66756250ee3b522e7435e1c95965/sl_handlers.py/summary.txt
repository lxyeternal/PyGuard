  "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated WSGI server handler that does not show evidence of malicious activity but employs significant obfuscation techniques. The low malware score aligns with the lack of explicit malicious actions, while the high obfuscation score indicates suspicion. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate server component with potential concealment tactics, warranting further review if deployed in sensitive environments."
