{
  "purpose": "The code imports all components from local modules 'server' and 'handlers' within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: '.server' and '.handlers'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially executing code from imported modules; no direct data sinks evident.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow is visible; imported modules may execute code upon import, but no direct source-to-sink flow is present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports (*) which can hide malicious code or unintended behaviors, and lack of visible code, making security assessment limited.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of two import statements with wildcard imports. Wildcard imports can obscure the actual code being imported, possibly hiding malicious code or unintended side effects. Without inspecting the content of 'server' and 'handlers', no malicious activity can be definitively identified here. The snippet itself does not perform any operations or contain suspicious logic, but the use of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to potential security and maintainability concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs only import operations from local modules with wildcard syntax. While this practice can conceal malicious code, the snippet alone does not show any malicious activity. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports which could hide malicious code within the imported modules. No explicit malicious behavior or malware is evident in this fragment.",
