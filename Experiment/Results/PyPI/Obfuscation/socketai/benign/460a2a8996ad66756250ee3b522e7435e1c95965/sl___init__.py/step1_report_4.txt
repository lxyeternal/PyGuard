{
  "purpose": "This code imports all symbols from the modules 'server' and 'handlers' within the same package, likely to include functionalities related to server operations and request handling.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.server, .handlers)",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; potential for imported modules to contain sinks, but none are shown in this snippet",
  "flows": "Imported modules may introduce further data flows, but none are explicitly shown in this code fragment",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure which symbols are imported, potentially hiding malicious or unintended code. No direct malicious behavior is visible in these lines alone.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements with wildcard imports from local modules. While wildcard imports can hide which functions or classes are imported, they are common in package initialization or structure. No suspicious or malicious code is evident within these lines. The security implications depend on the contents of the imported modules, which are not provided here.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet appears to be a standard import statement setup with no immediate signs of malicious behavior. The primary concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can hide imported symbols but does not itself indicate malicious intent. Without additional context or contents of the imported modules, there are no security risks apparent from this code alone.",
