  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verifying the presence of issues, consistency of scores, and the justification for risk levels.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All snippets are identical: simple wildcard imports from local modules 'server' and 'handlers'.\n- No code execution, data handling, or network activity is shown.\n- The main concern raised across reports is the use of 'import *', which can obscure the imported symbols and potentially hide malicious code.\n- No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or obfuscated code is present in the snippets themselves.\n- The confidence levels are moderate to high, given the limited context.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes, all reports correctly identify the use of wildcard imports as a potential concern but note that the code itself is benign.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No outright errors or malicious code are present. The main flaw is the use of 'import *', which is a style issue rather than a security flaw.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The malware scores are all zero, consistent with the absence of malicious activity.  \n  The obfuscated scores are zero, as no obfuscation is evident.  \n  The security risk scores are low (~0.2-0.3), reflecting minor maintainability concerns rather than security threats.\n\n---\n\n### Specific analysis per report:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- Purpose and analysis are accurate.  \n- Confidence: 0.6 is reasonable given the limited info.  \n- Malware: 0 is appropriate.  \n- Security risk: 0.2 is justified, as 'import *' can hide code but isn't malicious.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- Similar reasoning.  \n- Confidence: 0.5, slightly lower, seems reasonable.  \n- Malware: 0.0, no issues.  \n- Security risk: 0.3, slightly higher, justified by the potential for hidden symbols.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- Similar observations.  \n- Confidence: 0.6, justified.  \n- Malware: 0, no indication of malicious activity.  \n- Security risk: 0.2, consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- Same reasoning.  \n- Confidence: 0.6.  \n- Malware: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- Same reasoning.  \n- Confidence: 0.7, slightly higher, as the description is thorough.  \n- Malware: 0.  \n- Security risk: 0.2.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Are the scores consistent?**  \n  Yes, all are consistent with the analysis. The malware scores are zero, as expected.  \n  The obfuscated scores are zero, no obfuscation is evident.  \n  The security risk scores are low, reflecting the potential maintainability concern but not a security threat.\n\n- **Any claims based on assumptions?**  \n  The reports correctly acknowledge that without inspecting the imported modules, no malicious activity can be confirmed. The use of 'import *' is a style concern but not inherently malicious.\n\n---\n\n### **My overall estimate:**\n\n**Malware score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0  \n**Risk score:** 0.2 (reflecting maintainability issues, not security)\n\n**Rationale:**  \n- No malicious code, malware, or obfuscation detected.  \n- The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which can hide symbols and complicate security audits, but this alone does not constitute a security risk.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their assessment. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary. The code snippet itself is benign, with only style and maintainability concerns related to wildcard imports.",
