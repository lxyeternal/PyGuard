  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippet step-by-step.\n\n**Code snippet:**\n```python\nfrom .server import *\nfrom .handlers import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmed issues:\n- The code uses wildcard imports (`import *`) from local modules `.server` and `.handlers`. This practice is generally discouraged because it obscures which symbols are imported, complicates maintenance, and can potentially hide malicious code if the modules contain harmful definitions.\n\n### Logical and reasoning issues in reports:\n- All reports correctly identify the use of wildcard imports as a concern but conclude that there is no direct malicious activity or security risk based solely on this snippet.\n- They acknowledge that without inspecting the contents of `server` and `handlers`, it is impossible to definitively determine malicious intent.\n- The reports appropriately avoid assuming malicious behavior solely based on the import style.\n\n### Scores and their appropriateness:\n- **Malware score:** 0 in all reports. This is reasonable because the code snippet alone does not demonstrate malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all reports. The code is straightforward, just imports, so this is correct.\n- **Security risk:** Ranges from 0.2 to 0.3, mainly due to the use of `import *`. This is appropriate, as wildcard imports can introduce maintainability and security concerns, but do not directly cause vulnerabilities.\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports do not claim any specific vulnerabilities or malicious behaviors, which is appropriate given the limited code.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which could hide malicious code if the modules are compromised, but there's no evidence here.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **The code itself is benign**, but the use of wildcard imports warrants caution.\n- **No evidence of malware or obfuscation** is present.\n- The risk scores are reasonable and consistent with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n### My overall estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (code is clear and straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 (due to poor import practices, but no active security flaw)\n\n**Conclusion:** The code snippet is simple and not malicious, but the use of wildcard imports is a maintainability concern. No additional security risks are evident from this isolated fragment.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The reports correctly identify the wildcard import as a concern but do not overstate the risk.\n- The scores are appropriate and consistent.\n- No changes needed; the assessment aligns with best practices for such code snippets.",
