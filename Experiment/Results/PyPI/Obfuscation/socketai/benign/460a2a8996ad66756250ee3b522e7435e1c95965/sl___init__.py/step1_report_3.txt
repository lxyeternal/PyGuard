{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the modules 'server' and 'handlers' within the same package, likely to initialize or configure server-related functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements sourcing code from local modules './server' and './handlers'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, if the imported modules execute code upon import or set up network connections or handle untrusted data, these could act as sinks, but not directly from this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows are visible here; the code only performs imports, which could load code that executes further actions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard import '*' can lead to unclear dependencies and hidden behaviors. No malicious or suspicious code is directly visible in these import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from local modules, which is common in Python packages. Without inspecting the imported modules, no malicious behavior or security risks can be identified at this stage. The use of wildcard imports is generally discouraged as it can obscure dependencies and behaviors, but it does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or suspicious activity are evident in these lines.",
  "conclusion": "This code performs straightforward local module imports without evident malicious activity or security risks. The main concern is the use of wildcard imports, which could lead to less clear code dependencies but is not malicious per se.",
