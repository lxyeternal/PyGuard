  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code carefully.\n\n**Code under review:**\n```python\nfrom .server import *\nfrom .handlers import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- The code performs local module imports using wildcard syntax, which is generally discouraged but not inherently malicious.\n- No direct data sinks, network activity, or execution of untrusted code is visible here.\n- The code itself is minimal and standard for module imports.\n\n---\n\n### Evaluation of each report:\n\n**Reports 1-5** all describe similar observations: use of wildcard imports from local modules, potential obscurity, and no direct malicious activity.\n\n**Logical errors or flaws in the reports:**\n- The reports correctly identify that wildcard imports can hide symbols and obscure code flow, which is a valid concern for maintainability and potential security issues.\n- They do not, however, provide evidence that the imported modules contain malicious code, backdoors, or vulnerabilities.\n- The assessments correctly note that without inspecting the contents of `server` and `handlers`, no definitive malicious behavior can be determined.\n\n**Scores and their reasonableness:**\n- `malware`: 0 in all reports. This is appropriate given no evidence of malicious code.\n- `obfuscated`: 0 in all reports. This is acceptable; the code is straightforward, just imports.\n- `securityRisk`: scores are around 0.2 to 0.3, reflecting minor concerns due to wildcard imports, which is reasonable.\n\n**Risk scores > 0.5?**  \n- None of the reports assign a risk above 0.5, which aligns with the lack of concrete evidence of malicious activity.\n\n**Malware score justification:**\n- The malware score is 0 across all reports, which is justified given the information.\n\n**Potential assumptions or vulnerabilities:**\n- The reports do not make unwarranted assumptions; they acknowledge the limitations of the snippet.\n- They correctly point out that the practice of `import *` can hide issues but does not directly indicate malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n### Critical assessment:\n- The reports are consistent and cautious.\n- They do not overstate the risks.\n- They appropriately flag the use of wildcard imports as a concern for code clarity and maintainability, not as an immediate security threat.\n\n---\n\n### Final recommendation:\n- Based on the provided snippet and reports, **the current scores seem appropriate**.\n- The primary concern is maintainability and potential concealment of malicious code within the imported modules, but there's no evidence here to elevate the risk scores.\n\n---\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0 (code is straightforward)\n- **Risk score:** 0.2 - 0.3 (minor concern due to wildcard imports)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' assessments and the code's nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- The code is simple and standard for module imports.\n- No malicious activity or obfuscation is evident.\n- The main concern is the use of `import *`, which can hide symbols and obscure code flow but does not constitute a security threat by itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe current scores are reasonable. No changes needed unless further context about the contents of `server` and `handlers` modules suggests otherwise.",
