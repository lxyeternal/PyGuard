{
  "purpose": "Import all symbols from local modules 'server' and 'handlers' to make their functionalities available in the current namespace.",
  "sources": "The code reads data from the module files 'server' and 'handlers' during import.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks in this code snippet; no untrusted data is processed or transmitted.",
  "flows": "The flow is from the module files 'server' and 'handlers' into the current namespace via wildcard import.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('import *') which can obscure symbol origins and potentially hide malicious code within the modules.",
  "analysis": "The code performs simple local module imports using wildcard syntax, which is generally discouraged for maintainability but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. No data is processed, transmitted, or executed in an unsafe manner. The wildcard import can hide symbols and complicate security audits, but without inspecting the contents of 'server' and 'handlers', there is no evidence of malicious code or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2-0.3) are appropriate given the context. The primary concern is style and maintainability, not security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no malicious activity detected. The main issue is the use of wildcard imports, which should be replaced with explicit imports for clarity, but this does not constitute a security threat. The scores and assessments across reports are consistent and justified.",
