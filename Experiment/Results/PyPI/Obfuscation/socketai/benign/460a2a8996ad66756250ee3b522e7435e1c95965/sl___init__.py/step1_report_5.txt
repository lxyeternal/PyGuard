{
  "purpose": "The code imports all contents from the local modules 'server' and 'handlers', likely for setting up or managing a server and its associated handlers.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules 'server' and 'handlers'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as executing untrusted code, network communication, or data leaks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "There are no data flows within this snippet, as it only includes import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Use of 'import *' can obscure what is imported and potentially introduce unintended or malicious code if the modules contain malicious code. No explicit anomalies in the code itself, but the import style is generally discouraged.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of two import statements bringing in all exported members from 'server' and 'handlers' modules. This pattern can lead to namespace pollution and makes it difficult to track what functions or variables are used later. Without inspecting the contents of 'server' and 'handlers', no malicious behavior can be inferred solely from these import statements. The code itself is minimal and standard for module imports, but the use of wildcard imports warrants caution.\n\nThere are no signs of malicious intent such as code injection, data exfiltration, or hidden backdoors within this snippet. The security risk is minimal but the practice of 'import *' is generally discouraged due to potential maintenance and security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "This code primarily imports modules, with no immediate malicious behavior or security risks evident. The use of wildcard imports is a minor concern for code clarity and maintenance but does not indicate malicious intent.",
