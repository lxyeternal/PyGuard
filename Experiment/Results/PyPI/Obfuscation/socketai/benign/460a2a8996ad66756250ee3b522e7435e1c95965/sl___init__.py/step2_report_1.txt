  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the code snippet and the details provided.\n\n**Original Code:**\n```python\nfrom .server import *\nfrom .handlers import *\n```\n\n---\n\n### 1. **Report 1**\n- **Purpose:** Import all from local modules 'server' and 'handlers'.\n- **Analysis:** No malicious code visible; wildcard imports can hide symbols.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity; concern mainly about code clarity and maintainability.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \nThe reasoning is sound. Wildcard imports are discouraged but do not inherently indicate malicious intent. No evidence of malware or obfuscation. The low risk score (0.2) seems appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Report 2**\n- **Purpose:** Same as above.\n- **Analysis:** Wildcard imports can hide malicious code; no direct malicious activity visible.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious activity, only a concern about import style.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.3, confidence=0.5\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAgain, reasonable. The slightly higher risk score (0.3) is acceptable given the potential for hidden issues, but without evidence, it remains low.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Report 3**\n- **Purpose:** Import local modules for server functionalities.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; no direct malicious activity.\n- **Conclusion:** No immediate risk, mainly concern about wildcard import practices.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with previous assessments. No evidence of malware.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Report 4**\n- **Purpose:** Import modules for server setup.\n- **Analysis:** No suspicious activity; wildcard import can obscure symbols but is common.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior; primary concern is maintainability.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.6\n\n**Assessment:**  \nAppropriate. No indication of malicious code.\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Report 5**\n- **Purpose:** Similar import for server and handlers.\n- **Analysis:** No immediate malicious activity; import style is a concern.\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious intent; risk is minimal.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.7\n\n**Assessment:**  \nConsistent with others. The slightly higher confidence (0.7) is reasonable given the pattern.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Summary & Recommendations:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports correctly assign a malware score of 0, as there is no evidence of malicious code in the import statements themselves.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** All are 0, which is appropriate; the code is straightforward.\n- **Risk Score:** Generally low (0.2–0.3), reflecting concerns about wildcard imports but no direct threats.\n\n---\n\n### **My own assessment:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n  The code snippet alone does not contain malicious code. The use of wildcard imports is a style concern but not malicious.\n  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n  The code is clear; no obfuscation is present.\n  \n- **Risk:** 0.2  \n  The main risk stems from the use of 'import *', which can hide imported symbols and potentially conceal malicious code if the modules are compromised. However, without evidence of such, this remains a low concern.\n\n---\n\n### **Final notes:**\n\n- The reports are consistent and cautious, appropriately assigning low scores.\n- The primary security concern is maintainability and clarity, not malicious activity.\n- If further inspection of the 'server' and 'handlers' modules reveals malicious code, these scores would need to be revisited.\n\n**In conclusion, I agree with the current scoring and reasoning.**",
