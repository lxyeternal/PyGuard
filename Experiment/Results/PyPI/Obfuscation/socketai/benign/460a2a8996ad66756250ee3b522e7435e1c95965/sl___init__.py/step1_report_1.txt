  "purpose": "Import all contents from local modules 'server' and 'handlers' for use in the current package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules 'server' and 'handlers'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks for untrusted data or external effect observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows visible; only module imports.",
  "anomalies": "Use of wildcard imports ('*') can obscure the actual imported symbols, potentially hiding malicious code or unintended behaviors, but does not directly indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all definitions from two local modules using wildcard syntax. This practice can lead to namespace pollution and obscure the origins of functions or variables, which might conceal malicious or unintended code. However, the snippet itself contains no malicious code, no network or data handling, and no obvious security flaws. Without inspecting the contents of 'server' and 'handlers', no malicious behavior can be definitively identified here.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs simple module imports with wildcard syntax, which is a potential concern for code clarity and maintainability but does not, by itself, indicate malicious behavior. No malicious activity or security risks are evident from this snippet alone.",
