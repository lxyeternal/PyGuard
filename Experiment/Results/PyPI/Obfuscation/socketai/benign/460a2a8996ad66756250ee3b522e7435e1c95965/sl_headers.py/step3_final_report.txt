  "purpose": "Manage HTTP headers with functions for setting, deleting, retrieving, and formatting headers, including escaping header values to prevent injection issues.",
  "sources": "Function parameters (e.g., header values), internal header list (_headers).",
  "sinks": "Header storage and formatting; no external network or file I/O observed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters flow into internal header list; header values are escaped and stored; headers are formatted for output.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names; the escaping function replaces backslashes and quotes, likely for sanitization, not malicious purposes.",
  "analysis": "The code is a header management utility with superficial obfuscation. It performs standard operations such as adding, deleting, and retrieving headers, with escaping to prevent injection. No network activity, system modifications, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation appears intended for concealment rather than malicious intent. Potential security concern exists if external inputs are not validated before use, but the code itself handles escaping appropriately. The high obfuscation score (~0.8) reflects variable naming, while malware score remains at 0 due to lack of malicious behavior. The low risk (~0.2) indicates minimal vulnerability, primarily related to external input validation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated HTTP header utility with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. Its main concern is potential header injection if inputs are untrusted, but internal escaping mitigates this risk. Overall, it is a standard utility with superficial obfuscation, and the security risk is low.",
