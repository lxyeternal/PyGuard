  "conclusion": "The code functions as a security-focused WSGI middleware performing environment validation, header sanitization, and stream wrapping. Despite high obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores should reflect a low malware risk (around 0.2), high obfuscation (approximately 0.7), and low overall security risk (about 0.2)."
