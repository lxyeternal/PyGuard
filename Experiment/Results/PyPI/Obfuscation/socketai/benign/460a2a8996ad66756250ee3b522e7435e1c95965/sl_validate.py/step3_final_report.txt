  "purpose": "WSGI middleware for environment validation, header sanitization, and stream wrapping to ensure request integrity and compliance.",
  "sources": "Reads from 'wsgi.input', 'wsgi.errors', environment variables, headers, and request data.",
  "sinks": "Validation functions enforce data types and request structure; stream wrappers handle input/output streams; warnings and assertions flag issues.",
  "flows": "Input streams are wrapped; environment variables are validated; headers are sanitized; request data flows through validation functions before processing.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable names; extensive validation routines; warning class with a random string; no network activity or malicious payloads detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a set of validation utilities and middleware components for WSGI applications, focusing on environment checks, header validation, and stream handling. Obfuscated variable names suggest an intent to conceal internal logic, but all functions serve standard validation purposes. No signs of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or backdoors are present. The extensive validation and stream wrapping are consistent with security best practices, albeit with obfuscation that could be for security through obscurity. The absence of malicious code, network activity, or sabotage indicates a low malware likelihood. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming complexity, but this alone does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a security-focused WSGI middleware performing environment validation, header sanitization, and stream wrapping. Despite high obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores should reflect a low malware risk (around 0.2), high obfuscation (approximately 0.7), and low overall security risk (about 0.2).",
