No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The obfuscation warrants caution, but the overall security risk remains low."

The main issue is the use of wildcard imports, which should be replaced with explicit imports for clarity, but this does not constitute a security threat. The scores and assessments across reports are consistent and justified."

      "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The obfuscation and environment-adaptive features warrant cautious review, but based on static analysis, the overall security risk is moderate. The malware likelihood is low but not negligible due to obfuscation. Further dynamic analysis is recommended before deployment."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code is a complex, obfuscated WSGI server handler that does not show evidence of malicious activity but employs significant obfuscation techniques. The low malware score aligns with the lack of explicit malicious actions, while the high obfuscation score indicates suspicion. Overall, it appears to be a legitimate server component with potential concealment tactics, warranting further review if deployed in sensitive environments."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, obfuscated HTTP header utility with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. Its main concern is potential header injection if inputs are untrusted, but internal escaping mitigates this risk. Overall, it is a standard utility with superficial obfuscation, and the security risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a security-focused WSGI middleware performing environment validation, header sanitization, and stream wrapping. Despite high obfuscation, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or sabotage. The scores should reflect a low malware risk (around 0.2), high obfuscation (approximately 0.7), and low overall security risk (about 0.2)."
