{
  "purpose": "Static configuration and metadata for documentation, with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Variable initializations with static strings, lists, and dictionaries; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no data leaks, network activity, or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "N/A; static data assignments with no data flow or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; no functional code or malicious payloads.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments, likely for documentation purposes (e.g., Sphinx). Variable names are nonsensical, indicating obfuscation, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior, data leaks, or dynamic execution. No functions, input/output, or network activity are present. The static data appears benign and intended for configuration. The high obfuscation score is justified by variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. Malware and security risk scores are appropriately zero or minimal, reflecting the static, benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static, obfuscated configuration module with no malicious activity or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation is superficial and does not indicate malicious intent. The scores assigned in the reports are accurate and consistent with the code's benign nature.",
