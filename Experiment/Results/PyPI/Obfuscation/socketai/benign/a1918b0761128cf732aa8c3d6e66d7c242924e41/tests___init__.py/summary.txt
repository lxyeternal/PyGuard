  "security_risk": 0.3,

  "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks. Report 2 raises moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic eval/exec, warranting higher scores. Minor score adjustments improve alignment with observed behaviors. No evidence of malicious payloads is confirmed, and the overall supply chain risk remains low."
