  "purpose": "The purpose of this code appears to be a standard Python package setup or installation script, possibly related to package management or configuration.",
  "sources": "The code reads environment variables, package metadata files, and potentially user input or system data during execution.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include subprocess calls, network connections, or file operations that could leak data or perform malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or input files flows into subprocess calls or network operations, which could be exploited if untrusted data is used insecurely.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual control flows are observed. The code structure appears standard and well-formed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a typical setup or configuration script, utilizing standard libraries and practices.
