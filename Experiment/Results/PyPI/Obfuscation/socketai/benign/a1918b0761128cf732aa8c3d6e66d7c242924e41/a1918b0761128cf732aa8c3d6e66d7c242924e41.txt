      "conclusion": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscated variable names and command execution for publishing, showing no signs of malicious activity or malware. The main concerns are obfuscation and a hardcoded string that could be a secret. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate to high (~0.75), and the security risk is low (~0.2-0.3). Overall, it is a benign script with some stylistic obfuscation and minimal security concerns."

      "security_risk": 0.3,
      "obfuscated": 0.8,
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "conclusion": "The code functions as a complex, obfuscated address parsing and normalization utility with no confirmed malicious activity. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malware or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the observed behavior. The supply chain security incident appears to be related to the obfuscation rather than malicious payloads. Further runtime analysis and verification of external CSV files are recommended, but based on current information, the code is considered safe."

      "conclusion": "Most code appears benign with low security risks. Report 2 raises moderate suspicion due to obfuscation and dynamic eval/exec, warranting higher scores. Minor score adjustments improve alignment with observed behaviors. No evidence of malicious payloads is confirmed, and the overall supply chain risk remains low."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate address processing utility with significant obfuscation that warrants caution. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The suspicious import and obfuscated code should be further investigated, but based on the visible logic, the code does not exhibit malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscation high (~0.7), and low risk (~0.2)."
