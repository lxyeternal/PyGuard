  "conclusion": "The code functions as a complex, obfuscated address parsing and normalization utility with no confirmed malicious activity. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malware or sabotage. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with the observed behavior. The supply chain security incident appears to be related to the obfuscation rather than malicious payloads. Further runtime analysis and verification of external CSV files are recommended, but based on current information, the code is considered safe."
