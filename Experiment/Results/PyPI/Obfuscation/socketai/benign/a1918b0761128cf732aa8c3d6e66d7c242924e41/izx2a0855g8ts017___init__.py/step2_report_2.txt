  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a single import statement: `from .parser import *` or similar.\n- The code snippets are minimal, only performing a module import.\n- No data flows, network activity, or data processing are present.\n- No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are evident.\n- All reports agree on the benign nature of the code.\n\n**Specific review:**\n\n### Report 1\n- **Purpose:** Import all functions/classes from local 'parser'.\n- **Analysis:** Correctly identifies no malicious behavior; straightforward import.\n- **Score justification:** Malware=0, Obfuscated=0, Risk=0. The confidence is high (1).\n\n### Report 2\n- **Purpose:** Import from `.parser`.\n- **Analysis:** Same as above; minimal code, no suspicious activity.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 is slightly above zero but justified as a very low security risk due to the import nature, not malicious intent.\n- **Confidence:** 0.8, which is reasonable given the limited code.\n\n### Report 3\n- **Purpose:** Import all from local parser.\n- **Analysis:** Same conclusion; benign import statement.\n- **Risk score:** 0.1 again, consistent with minimal risk.\n- **Confidence:** 0.9, slightly higher due to the consistent pattern.\n\n### Report 4\n- **Purpose:** Import from local parser.\n- **Analysis:** No anomalies or malicious signs.\n- **Scores:** All zero except confidence=1, appropriate.\n\n### Report 5\n- **Purpose:** Import all components from local parser.\n- **Analysis:** Same benign assessment.\n- **Scores:** All zero except confidence=1.\n\n---\n\n### Overall assessment:\n- **Code presence:** The code is just an import statement, no malicious code or obfuscation.\n- **Malware score:** All reports correctly assign 0, as there's no evidence of malicious activity.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 in all cases, consistent with the straightforward import.\n- **Risk score:** Slightly above zero (0.1) in some reports, justified by the minimal risk associated with imports, but no actual security threat.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores are consistent with the code snippet.\n- The risk scores could be uniformly set to 0, as there's no security risk demonstrated.\n- The malware and obfuscated scores should remain at 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final judgment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple import statement with no malicious or suspicious behavior. The minimal risk score reflects the fact that importing modules, in general, is not a security concern unless combined with other malicious code, which is not present here.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:** All reports are accurate in their benign assessment. No changes needed; the code is safe and not obfuscated.",
