  "flows": "Not applicable; the code only contains an import statement, with no data flow or processing visible.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, only importing a module without any additional logic, which is typical for a module initializer or stub. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious behavior is present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports all symbols from a local parser module, which could be used for parsing data within the package. There are no signs of malicious code, data leakage, or obfuscated behavior. The snippet is too limited to suggest any malicious intent or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "This is a simple import statement with no evident malicious or security risks. The code appears benign, serving as a part of a larger codebase, and contains no suspicious behavior.",
