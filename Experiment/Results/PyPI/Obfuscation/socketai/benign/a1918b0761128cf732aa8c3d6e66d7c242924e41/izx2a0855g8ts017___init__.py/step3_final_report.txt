  "purpose": "Import all functions/classes from the local 'parser' module.",
  "sources": "The import statement itself; no data input or external sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output; import is static.",
  "flows": "Import statement does not create data flows or execute code beyond module loading.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward import statement with no obfuscation or malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, standard import statement. No suspicious patterns, obfuscation, or malicious behavior are present. The import does not involve dynamic execution, network activity, or data leakage. The code's minimal nature and lack of additional logic support a benign assessment. Scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are all zero, consistent with the code's simplicity. Confidence in benign nature is high (1).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, straightforward import statement with no signs of malicious activity or obfuscation. The security risk is negligible, and the scores reflect this. No further action or concern is warranted.",
