  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The code is a straightforward import statement.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The reasoning is sound.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are zero, which is appropriate. Security risk is zero.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The confidence is high (1).\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Again, just a simple relative import.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None. The reasoning is consistent.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are zero, which aligns with the minimal code. Security risk is low (0.1), possibly due to the slight uncertainty.\n- **Justification:** No signs of malicious behavior. The confidence is slightly lower (0.8), which is reasonable given the minimal code.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The import is standard.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are zero, which is appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity or obfuscation. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are zero; security risk is zero.\n- **Justification:** The code is benign. Confidence is 1.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors/flaws?** None.\n- **Scores:** Malware and obfuscated scores are zero; security risk is zero.\n- **Justification:** No suspicious activity detected. Confidence is perfect (1).\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- All reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues.\n- The scores assigned (malware, obfuscated, risk) are consistent with the code's simplicity.\n- No adjustments needed based on the code snippet.\n\n### Final assessment:\nGiven the code is a single, standard import statement with no malicious or suspicious activity, **my estimated scores** would be:\n\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malware activity)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk)\n\nThis aligns with the reports' conclusions and the nature of the code.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n- The reports are accurate and consistent.\n- No further action or concern is warranted for this code snippet.",
