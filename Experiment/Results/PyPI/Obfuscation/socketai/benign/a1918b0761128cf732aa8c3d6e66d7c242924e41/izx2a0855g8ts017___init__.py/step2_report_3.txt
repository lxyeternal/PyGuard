  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe the same code snippet: `from .parser import *` (or similar variations).\n- The code is a simple import statement importing all contents from a local module named 'parser'.\n- No data processing, network activity, or suspicious behavior is indicated.\n- The reports consistently conclude that the code is benign and poses no security risk.\n\n**Confirming issues in the code:**\n- The code is straightforward and matches the description; no issues or anomalies are present.\n- No evidence of malicious code, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns.\n\n**Errors, flaws, or mistakes in the reports:**\n- The reports are consistent and accurate; they correctly identify the code as benign.\n- No logical flaws or reasoning errors are evident.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores of 0 or very close to 0.\n- These scores are appropriate given the code's simplicity.\n- The confidence scores are high, reflecting certainty about benign nature.\n\n**Justification for risk scores > 0.5:**\n- None of the reports assign a risk higher than 0.1, which is appropriate.\n- The code does not perform any suspicious actions, so higher scores are unjustified.\n\n**Malware score considerations:**\n- The code is a benign import statement; no malicious activity is evident.\n- Malware score of 0 is justified.\n\n**Challenging assumptions:**\n- The assumption that importing a module is safe is valid here; no evidence suggests malicious intent.\n- No obfuscation or hidden malicious behavior is indicated.\n\n**Score consistency:**\n- All scores are consistent with the analysis.\n- The minimal code snippet justifies low risk and malware scores.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n**Estimated malware score:** **0**  \n**Estimated obfuscated score:** **0**  \n**Estimated security risk score:** **0**\n\n**Rationale:**  \nThe code is a simple, standard import statement with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security issues. All reports correctly identify this, and the scores reflect the benign nature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate and consistent. No modifications are necessary. The code is benign, and the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at zero.",
