  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; no data processing or output functions",
  "flows": "Not enough code to determine data flow; only an import statement present",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, no unusual language features, or obfuscation observed",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple import statement using relative import syntax. It does not process data, interact with external sources, or perform any logic. No signs of malicious behavior or anomalies are present. The code's minimal nature limits detailed analysis but also reduces risk indicators.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a standard import statement with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It appears to be a fragment of a larger codebase, with no malicious behavior detectable in this snippet.",
