  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate address processing utility with significant obfuscation that warrants caution. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The suspicious import and obfuscated code should be further investigated, but based on the visible logic, the code does not exhibit malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscation high (~0.7), and low risk (~0.2)."
