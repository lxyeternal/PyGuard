{
  "purpose": "The code performs address parsing, validation, and data processing, reading addresses from strings and files, then outputting structured CSV data.",
  "sources": "Input addresses from hardcoded strings and files, notably the 'crime_addresses' file and hardcoded address strings.",
  "sinks": "CSV output files where processed address data is written; no external network or system modifications are evident.",
  "flows": "Addresses are read from input sources, processed via the imported address_parser module, and results are written to CSV files after filtering and formatting.",
  "anomalies": "Suspicious import of 'address_parser' with an obfuscated function name; heavily obfuscated variable and function names; complex exception handling; inclusion of placeholder-like addresses such as 'crime_addresses'.",
  "analysis": "The code is designed for address data normalization and validation, utilizing an imported module with an obfuscated name, which raises suspicion. The obfuscation and complex structure could be used to hide malicious intent, but no explicit malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification are present. The import and variable naming are red flags, but the core logic appears to be address processing. The scores assigned in the reports—malware 0, obfuscation high (~0.7), low security risk (~0.2)—are consistent with the observed code. The lack of external malicious activity suggests the code is benign but obfuscated, warranting further review of the imported module.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate address processing utility with significant obfuscation that warrants caution. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The suspicious import and obfuscated code should be further investigated, but based on the visible logic, the code does not exhibit malicious activity. The assigned scores are appropriate, with malware at 0, obfuscation high (~0.7), and low risk (~0.2).",
