  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a legitimate 3D model loader with obfuscation and minor code issues. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate (0.6), and overall security risk is low (0.2). The obfuscation and incomplete code should be reviewed, but no malicious intent is indicated."
