{
  "purpose": "Load and process 3D model files in specific formats using the vedo library, returning a structured surface object.",
  "sources": "The code reads input from a file path provided to the functions, specifically in the function 'lZQUIWQQUjgYgYpOOKvGhbcJswUaCXJh'.",
  "sinks": "Potentially, the 'vedo.load' function could process untrusted files, but it is a standard library for visualization, not inherently malicious.",
  "flows": "Input file path -> check file extension -> load file with vedo -> process with utility function -> return structured data.",
  "anomalies": "The function 'lZQUIWQQUjgYgYpOOKvGhbcJswUaCXJh' raises NotImplementedError for lists, which is a minor oddity; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code validates the file extension against a set of 3D model formats, then loads the file using vedo.load, a common visualization library. It imports a utility module and applies a function to the loaded object. No code injection, data leaks, or suspicious network activity is evident. The use of the vedo library for visualization is typical in 3D processing. No obfuscation, backdoors, or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code is designed for loading 3D models and appears benign, with no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It utilizes standard libraries and performs expected file handling operations.",
