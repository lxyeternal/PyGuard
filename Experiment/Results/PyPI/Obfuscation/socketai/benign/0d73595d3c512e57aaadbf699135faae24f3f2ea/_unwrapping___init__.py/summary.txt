  "conclusion": "The snippet shows standard import statements with obfuscated identifiers, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious activity. The high obfuscation score warrants further review, but no active malicious behavior is evident from this code alone. The overall security risk remains low, but caution is advised until the imported modules are examined."
