  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules for use within the package.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .unwrap and .projections.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks; no data output or network operations present.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow; only static import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers from .unwrap appear to be obfuscated or randomly named, suggesting potential concealment or malicious intent. The import names do not indicate their purpose, which could be suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from local modules, with function or class names that seem randomly generated or obfuscated. There is no evidence of code execution, data handling, or network activity. The obfuscated identifiers might indicate attempts to hide malicious functions or classes. However, without access to the actual implementation of these imported items, it is impossible to definitively determine malicious intent. The presence of obfuscated names warrants caution, but based solely on import statements, no malicious behavior is explicitly evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code only performs import operations with potentially obfuscated identifiers, which could be an attempt to hide malicious functions or classes. No malicious behavior is directly observable from these import statements alone, but the obfuscation warrants further review of the imported modules.",
