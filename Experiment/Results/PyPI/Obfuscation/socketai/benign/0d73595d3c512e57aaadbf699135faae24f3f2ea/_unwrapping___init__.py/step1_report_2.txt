  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules related to unwrapping and projection calculations.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .unwrap and .projections",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data input or external data sinks present in this snippet",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input; the code only imports functions/classes",
  "anomalies": "Imported names from .unwrap appear to be obfuscated or nonsensical, potentially suspicious; no other anomalies observed",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions with seemingly random or obfuscated names from local modules. The imports themselves do not perform any malicious actions. The use of obfuscated or nonsensical identifiers can sometimes indicate malicious intent or an attempt to hide functionality. However, without additional context or code execution, this cannot be confirmed. No evidence of malicious behavior or security risks is visible in this import statement alone.",
  "conclusion": "The code only imports functions with obfuscated names from local modules, which could be suspicious but is not inherently malicious. There is no clear malicious behavior or security risk evident in this snippet.",
