  "purpose": "Import specific functions or classes from local modules 'unwrap' and 'projections' within the package.",

  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no data processing or external communication in this snippet.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flows; only static imports are present.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming conventions for imported functions/classes (e.g., 'xQnpWDuoEefaceDNyDxKCEGArmuvyimP') which appear obfuscated or randomly generated.",
  "analysis": "The code imports functions or classes with non-descriptive, seemingly random names from local modules. The use of such obscure identifiers is often a red flag for obfuscation, but can also be legitimate in certain contexts. No external network activity, no hardcoded secrets, and no code execution are present. The presence of complex or meaningless names warrants suspicion but is not conclusive of malicious intent on its own.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to importing functions or classes with obfuscated names from local modules. There are no active behaviors, external communications, or malicious indicators in this snippet. The unusual naming could suggest obfuscation, but without further context, it cannot be definitively deemed malicious.",
