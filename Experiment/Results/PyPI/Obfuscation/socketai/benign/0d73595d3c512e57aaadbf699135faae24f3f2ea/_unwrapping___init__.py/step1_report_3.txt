  "purpose": "Import specific functions from local modules for further processing or calculations.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules (.unwrap and .projections).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks that handle untrusted data or output; imports are for internal code use.",
  "flows": "Imported functions may be used later in the code to process data; no explicit data flow present in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "Imported function names 'xQnpWDuoEefaceDNyDxKCEGArmuvyimP' and 'ktSjKwzQGCqmkqfqqUqzEpoDTbSDqXNf' are obfuscated or nonsensical, indicating possible obfuscation or malicious intent. The use of long, random-looking identifiers suggests intentional concealment.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements, which reference functions with obfuscated or nonsensical names. This pattern can be associated with obfuscated code attempting to hide malicious activity. No other code or logic is present to further evaluate. Without additional context, the obfuscation raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent by itself. The import of 'mercator_projection' from a different module appears benign, but the function names in 'unwrap' module are suspicious.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits signs of obfuscation through nonsensical function names, which may indicate malicious intent or concealment of malicious functionality. However, with only import statements and no further logic, it is difficult to definitively classify it as malicious. Caution is advised if this code is part of a larger, unknown project.",
