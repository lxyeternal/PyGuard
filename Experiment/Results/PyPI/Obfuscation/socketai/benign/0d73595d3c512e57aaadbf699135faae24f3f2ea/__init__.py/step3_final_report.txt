  "purpose": "Module import statements for spectral analysis, signatures, unwrapping, reading, and writing functionalities.",
  "sources": "Import statements from internal modules (_reader, _sample_data, _writer, _spectral, _signatures, _unwrapping) and an unused variable assignment.",
  "sinks": "None present; no data flow to external systems or untrusted sources.",
  "flows": "N/A; the code only performs static imports and variable assignment.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of an obfuscated, nonsensical variable name 'FBgGelGfWtINDiJvdqRTPZQuHwgDrQiC' that is unused, suggesting obfuscation or placeholder.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import block with an unused, obfuscated variable. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or data handling is evident. The variable name raises suspicion but does not impact functionality. All import statements are standard for modular Python packages. The absence of malicious functions, data leaks, or suspicious behaviors indicates a benign fragment. The obfuscated variable is not used and does not influence the module's behavior, reducing risk. The scores assigned in the reports (malware = 0, low security risk, moderate obfuscation suspicion) are consistent with this analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no evidence of malicious intent or security vulnerabilities. The only concern is the obfuscated variable name, which is unused and does not pose a threat. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the module appears safe.",
