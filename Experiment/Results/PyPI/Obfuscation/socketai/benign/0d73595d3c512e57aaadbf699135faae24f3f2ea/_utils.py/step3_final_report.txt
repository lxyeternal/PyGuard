  "purpose": "Mesh data processing: converting vedo.Mesh to TriMesh, extracting coordinate arrays, and creating vedo.Mesh from surface data.",
  "sources": "Access to mesh attributes such as TJXotyRqsCIWBBeiNsyAVcySuzcbmsEv, cells, aguTAwTMZHBTyLOJDnohGYnLzTeRnqBl(), and RgtYJaNrQhFtargdRZcpNlnnaTnOGGnH.",
  "sinks": "No network, file I/O, or external data transmission observed.",
  "flows": "Mesh attribute access and data extraction functions operate internally without external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names, which are suspicious but not inherently malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate mesh data conversions and extraction, with no signs of malicious API calls or network activity. The obfuscated attribute names could be internal but are suspicious. The functions rely on standard libraries and internal attributes, which may be legitimate or used to hide malicious intent. No malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication is evident. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be legitimate mesh processing code with obfuscated identifiers. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not sufficient to classify the code as malicious. Scores should reflect low malware likelihood, moderate suspicion due to obfuscation, and low security risk.",
