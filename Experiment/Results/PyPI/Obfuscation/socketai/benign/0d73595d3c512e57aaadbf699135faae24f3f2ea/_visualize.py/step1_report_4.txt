{
  "purpose": "Generate surface data visualizations and process mesh normals using external libraries.",
  "sources": "Reads input mesh data, numpy arrays, and parameters; imports vedo and napari_stress modules.",
  "sinks": "Calls external visualization functions; processes data for visualization; does not send data externally or write to files.",
  "flows": "Reads mesh data and parameters, computes normals, performs mathematical operations, then processes data for visualization.",
  "anomalies": "Uses dynamic imports; the amplitude_scale value is very large (1e5), but this is not inherently malicious; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious code patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs a 3D mesh from input data, computes normals, performs mathematical transformations involving numpy and sine functions, and applies a significant amplitude scaling. It then combines this data with normal vectors and other mesh information to prepare surface data for visualization. The use of external visualization libraries (vedo and napari_stress) is standard for such applications. No evidence of data exfiltration, malicious network activity, or backdoors was found. The code does not contain obfuscation, hardcoded credentials, or suspicious dynamic code execution. Overall, the code appears to be for scientific or visualization purposes without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for visualization and mesh processing, with no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. It processes data and visualizes it responsibly, without engaging in malicious actions or data exfiltration.",
