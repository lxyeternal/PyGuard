  "purpose": "Constructs a 3D mesh from surface data, computes normals, applies sinusoidal modulation with Gaussian envelope, scales data, and prepares visualization layers for napari.",
  "sources": "Surface data input arrays, external modules vedo and napari_stress.TimelapseConverter, numpy operations.",
  "sinks": "Data layers for visualization, mesh and normal computations, no network or data exfiltration points.",
  "flows": "Surface data -> Mesh creation -> Normal computation -> Mathematical transformations (sin, Gaussian envelope) -> Data scaling and augmentation -> Data formatting for napari visualization.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable names, large amplitude scaling factor (1e5), dynamic imports, but no suspicious code patterns or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific visualization tasks: mesh generation, normal calculation, sinusoidal modulation, and data preparation. Obfuscated variable names are present but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or code injection detected. The large amplitude scaling appears to be for visualization effects, not malicious behavior. External modules are used appropriately for visualization purposes. The mathematical operations are typical for data processing in visualization workflows.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a complex visualization routine with obfuscated variable names. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is present. The high obfuscation score reflects variable naming but does not imply malicious intent. Overall security risk is low.",
