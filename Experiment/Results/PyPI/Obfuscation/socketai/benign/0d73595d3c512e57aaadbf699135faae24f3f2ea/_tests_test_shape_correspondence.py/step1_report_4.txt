{
  "purpose": "The code appears to load a 3D model, visualize it using napari and vedo, and perform some processing with a custom widget, possibly for landmark annotation or analysis.",
  "sources": "Imports vedo, napari shape module, numpy, qtpy for Qt components, and a custom signature function; loads a 'cow.vtk' 3D model via vedo.",
  "sinks": "Uses visualization widgets and custom functions, no evident data sinks that send untrusted data externally or perform malicious network activity.",
  "flows": "Imports data from vedo.load, processes it, visualizes with napari, and interacts with custom widget methods which manipulate or process data internally.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses highly obfuscated variable names, includes an imported function from a custom package, and performs multiple widget state changes without clear purpose; no hardcoded secrets or suspicious logic found.",
  "analysis": "The code loads a 3D model and adds it to a napari viewer, then creates and interacts with a custom widget class, changing widget states and calling methods. All operations seem related to visualization and user interaction. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious system modifications are present. Obfuscated variable names could indicate an attempt to hide intent, but all code functionality appears benign and related to visualization.",
  "conclusion": "The code's main function is to load and visualize a 3D model within a napari viewer, and manipulate a custom widget for likely annotation or analysis purposes. No malicious behaviors such as data theft, network connections, or system modifications are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial, possibly for code concealment, but the logic itself is benign.",
