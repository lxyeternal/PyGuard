  "conclusion": "The code is intended for mesh processing with external dependencies. It does not contain malicious code but poses supply chain security risks due to dynamic binary downloads and execution without validation. The obfuscated variable names and command construction practices increase the security concern. The overall malware likelihood is low, but the external dependency handling warrants caution. Recommended mitigations include verifying binary signatures, sanitizing command inputs, and minimizing runtime downloads."
