{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a standard Python script performing data processing or utility functions, with no immediately evident malicious intent.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from environment variables and possibly user input through standard input or parameters, if any are present.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks could occur if sensitive data from environment variables or inputs are transmitted over network or written to logs/files.",
  "flows": "Data from environment variables or user inputs flow into processing functions, but there is no evidence of data being transmitted externally or misused.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or obfuscated code detected. No unusual control flows or dynamic execution identified.",
  "analysis": "The code does not include obfuscated constructs, suspicious network calls, or backdoors. It uses standard libraries and typical programming patterns. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious data handling observed. The absence of dangerous functions like exec, eval with untrusted input, or network connections reduces concern. The overall structure indicates legitimate utility code without malicious features.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks. The code appears benign and aligns with typical application logic.",
