  "sources": "Environment variables, user inputs, external URLs, network sockets, system commands, hardcoded IPs/URLs, data files.",
  "sinks": "Network communication, file operations, system commands, data exfiltration points, output streams.",
  "flows": "Input sources (env vars, user input, URLs) to processing functions, then to sinks such as network or file operations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval()/exec(), obfuscation, hardcoded IPs/URLs, misleading variable names, dynamic code execution, suspicious data flows.",
  "analysis": "The code with eval/exec and obfuscation indicates potential malicious intent, with high suspicion of dynamic code execution and data exfiltration. Benign code shows standard patterns without suspicious traits. Missing code reports correctly lack analysis. The scores assigned reflect the suspicion levels and observed behaviors, with high confidence in benign assessments where appropriate.",
  "conclusion": "Report 2 indicates potentially malicious, obfuscated code with dynamic execution, justifying a malware score of 0.6 and obfuscation score of 0.8. Other reports are benign, with low malware and risk scores. The scores are consistent with the described traits and analysis.",
