  "purpose": "Configure Python package setup, optionally enabling user site-packages based on command-line arguments.",
  "sources": "Command-line arguments (`sys.argv`), `site.ENABLE_USER_SITE` attribute, `setuptools.setup()` call.",
  "sinks": "The setup process influenced by `site.ENABLE_USER_SITE` setting, which affects installation environment.",
  "flows": "Command-line argument parsing leads to setting `site.ENABLE_USER_SITE`, which then influences the setup process.",
  "anomalies": "Unconventional modification of `site.ENABLE_USER_SITE` based on command-line input; no malicious code or obfuscation detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports standard modules and dynamically sets `site.ENABLE_USER_SITE` depending on presence of '--user' in command-line args, then calls `setuptools.setup()` with version control enabled. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or data exfiltration are present. The modification is unusual but benign, typical in some setup scripts. No obfuscation or suspicious patterns are observed. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.1) are justified given the minimal impact of the dynamic setting. Overall, the code is a standard, safe setup script with no security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign setup routine with a minor unconventional modification. No malicious activity or obfuscation detected. The security risk is minimal and scores are appropriate. No further action required.",
