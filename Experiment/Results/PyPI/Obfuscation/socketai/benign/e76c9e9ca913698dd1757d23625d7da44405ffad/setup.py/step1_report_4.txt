{
  "purpose": "Configure package setup with SCM versioning, enabling user site if '--user' argument is provided",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments from sys.argv",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data directly causes data leaks or system effects",
  "flows": "Command-line argument '--user' influences setting in site.ENABLE_USER_SITE; then setup is called",
  "anomalies": "Uses sys.argv[1:] without validation, which could be manipulated, but this is typical for setup scripts",
  "analysis": "The code imports sys and site modules to check for '--user' argument in command-line inputs. It sets site.ENABLE_USER_SITE accordingly, then calls setuptools.setup with use_scm_version=True. The purpose appears to be to enable user site directory support during package installation and to set up versioning via SCM. No malicious code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious behaviors are present. The code relies on standard modules and practices, with no evident security issues or malware indicators.",
  "conclusion": "This is a straightforward setup script configuring package installation parameters. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
