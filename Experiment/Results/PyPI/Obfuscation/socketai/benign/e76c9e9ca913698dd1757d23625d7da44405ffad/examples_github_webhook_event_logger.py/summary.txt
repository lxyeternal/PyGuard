  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and risky dynamic behaviors, including unvalidated external command execution and path handling, which could facilitate malicious activities such as command injection or data exfiltration. While no direct malware payloads are present, the practices observed warrant caution and further review before deployment. The overall security risk is moderate to high due to these factors."
