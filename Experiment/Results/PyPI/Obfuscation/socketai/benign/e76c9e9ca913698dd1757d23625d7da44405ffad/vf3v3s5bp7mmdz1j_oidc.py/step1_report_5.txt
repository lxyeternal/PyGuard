{
  "purpose": "The code appears to set up a mock OpenID Connect server that generates and provides JWT tokens and JWK sets for testing or development purposes.",
  "sources": "Input sources include command-line arguments, optional PEM key files, and URL responses from a local server.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leak occurs if tokens or keys are written to files or printed; network requests to fetch tokens and serve endpoints may be exploited if not properly secured.",
  "flows": "Command-line inputs set issuer, subject, audience, and file paths; server endpoints generate JWT tokens and JWKs; tokens are fetched via URL and possibly written to specified files.",
  "anomalies": "The code generates RSA keys if none are provided, which is normal; however, it writes private keys to disk if a path is provided, potentially exposing sensitive data. The server runs an infinite loop with sleep, which is typical for a long-running test server, not suspicious. There is no malicious code like data exfiltration or external connections to unknown domains.",
  "analysis": "The code is a self-contained mock server for OpenID Connect that generates tokens and JWKs, primarily for testing purposes. It reads configuration from command-line arguments and files, generating keys if needed, and serving endpoints that return tokens and key data. The server runs indefinitely, sleeping between requests. No obfuscated code, hardcoded secrets, or malicious network behavior is observed. The use of private keys on disk could be risky if improperly protected but is common for local testing setups. No malware or malicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The script functions as a local mock OIDC server intended for testing and development. It does not exhibit malicious behavior or supply chain sabotage, but improper handling of private keys (writing to disk) could pose security concerns in a real environment. Overall, it appears benign.",
