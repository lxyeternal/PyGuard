  "conclusion": "The code snippet is benign, with no evidence of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the evidence. The main security consideration is the trustworthiness of the external module, which cannot be assessed here. Overall, the import statement alone does not pose a security threat, but reliance on external modules warrants ongoing verification."
