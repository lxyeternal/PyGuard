{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide utility functions for environment information, URL construction, token retrieval, and interaction with a specific API (pyvo).",
  "sources": "Environment variables (HOSTNAME, EXTERNAL_*_URL, KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME, JUPYTER_IMAGE_SPEC, JUPYTERLAB_CONFIG_DIR, NUBLADO_RUNTIME_MOUNTS_DIR, ACCESS_TOKEN), file reads for tokens.",
  "sinks": "Requests session headers (Authorization), environment variable outputs, file reads for tokens.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file reads feed into authorization headers and token variables; URL functions generate URLs from environment variables; token functions retrieve tokens for API access.",
  "anomalies": "Function wpXKlpVEpSCfkGWuFocFvyKkTkGigJzK uses high-scale division but is benign; variable names are obfuscated; no suspicious code injection or backdoors are visible; deprecated function is harmless; no evident malicious data exfiltration or system damage mechanisms.",
  "analysis": "The code contains multiple utility functions for environment info and URL generation, with some obscure naming conventions. The token retrieval functions safely read from files or environment variables, with no suspicious handling. The URL construction combines environment variables, which is standard. The code uses deprecated decorators, but this does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity besides standard requests session setup is present. No hardcoded credentials or backdoors are found. No obfuscated or malicious payloads are detected. Overall, the code appears benign, serving configuration and environment querying purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is benign utility code with no signs of malicious behavior or malware. It handles environment info, URL construction, and token management securely without suspicious patterns.",
