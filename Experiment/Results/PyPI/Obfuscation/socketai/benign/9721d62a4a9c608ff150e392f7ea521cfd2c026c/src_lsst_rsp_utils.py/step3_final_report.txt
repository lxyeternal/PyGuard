  "purpose": "Utility functions for environment configuration, URL handling, token retrieval, and API session setup in a Python project.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (e.g., HOSTNAME, EXTERNAL_INSTANCE_URL, environment-specific URLs), token files read from filesystem, environment variables for tokens.",
  "sinks": "Requests session headers (Authorization token), URL join operations, environment variable reads, file reads for tokens.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file reads serve as sources; tokens are used in request headers and URL construction; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks indicating malicious activity.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names, use of deprecated decorators, reliance on environment variables and file tokens which could be manipulated if environment is compromised, but no malicious payloads or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily provides configuration utilities, environment info, and API session setup. No signs of malicious code such as network exfiltration, code injection, or payloads. Obfuscation appears superficial, possibly legacy or stylistic. Environment-dependent tokens and URLs are standard but pose risks if environment is maliciously altered. No active malicious behavior or payloads detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a utility/configuration module with no evidence of malware or malicious intent. The security risk is low, mainly related to environment manipulation, which is typical in such systems. Obfuscation is minimal and not malicious.",
