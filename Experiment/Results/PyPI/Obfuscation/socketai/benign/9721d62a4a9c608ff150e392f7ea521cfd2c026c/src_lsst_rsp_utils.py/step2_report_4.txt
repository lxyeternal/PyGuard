  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and systematically:\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** The code is a utility module handling environment configuration, URL building, and API interaction via pyvo. It uses environment variables and file reads for tokens, and constructs URLs dynamically, which could be manipulated if environment variables are maliciously set.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** The code relies on environment variables for sensitive info, which is common but risky if environment is compromised. No malicious payloads or backdoors are present. Use of deprecated decorator suggests legacy code, not malicious intent.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No active malicious behavior, primarily configuration code. Security risk is moderate (~0.3). Confidence 0.8.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0 (no malware detected).\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar utility functions for environment info, URL, token management. The code handles tokens and URLs, with potential risks if environment variables are manipulated.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated function names, deprecated decorator, no malicious payloads. Standard practices used, but environment variables could be misused if environment is compromised.\n\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, low suspicion (~0.2 security risk). Confidence 0.8.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Error:** JSON parse error indicates a problem with the report's formatting, not code.\n\n- **Content:** The report summarizes similar points: environment variables, token files, URL construction, no malicious payloads, obfuscated names, standard API setup.\n\n- **Analysis & Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious intent. The code is utility/configuration, with risks mainly if environment is compromised.\n\n- **Confidence:** 0.8, malware 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Utility functions for environment info, URL, token retrieval, with no malicious logic.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated variable names, deprecated decorator, but no malicious payloads or backdoors. Standard environment and token handling.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No malicious behavior, low security risk (~0.1). Confidence 0.9.\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Sources/Sinks/Flows:** Similar utility functions, environment variables, token files, API session setup.\n\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated function names, minimal comments, but no malicious code. Standard credential management.\n\n- **Conclusion:** No signs of malware or malicious activity. Low security risk (~0.2). Confidence 0.8.\n\n---\n\n### Summary & Final Assessment:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports indicate no malware detected. The code is primarily utility/configuration, with no payloads, backdoors, or malicious network activity.\n\n- **Obfuscated:** Slightly, due to function and variable names, but not malicious.\n\n- **Risk Score:** While environment variables and file-based tokens could be exploited if environment is compromised, this is standard practice. No active malicious behavior is evident.\n\n---\n\n### My Expert Estimate:\n\n- **Malware:** **0** — No signs of malicious code or payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** **0.3** — Some obfuscation in naming, but not malicious.\n- **Risk:** **0.2-0.3** — Standard environment/configuration risks, but no active threats.\n\n**Final note:** The code appears to be a set of utility functions for environment and API configuration. The main concern is reliance on environment variables and token files, which could be exploited if the environment is compromised, but this is typical in many systems. No malware or malicious activity is evident.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nBased on the provided reports and code analysis, I assign the following scores:\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0.3  \n- **Risk:** 0.2\n\nThe overall security posture of this code segment is low risk, primarily configuration-related, with no active malicious behavior.",
