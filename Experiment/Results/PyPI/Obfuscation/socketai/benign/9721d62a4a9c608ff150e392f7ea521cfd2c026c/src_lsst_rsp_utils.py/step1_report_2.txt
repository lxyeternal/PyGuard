{
  "purpose": "The code appears to provide utility functions for environment variable access, URL construction, token retrieval, and formatting sizes, likely for a larger application involving network communication and cloud resource management.",
  "sources": "Environment variables (HOSTNAME, EXTERNAL_* URLs, KUBERNETES_NODE_NAME, JUPYTER_IMAGE_SPEC, JUPYTERLAB_CONFIG_DIR, NUBLADO_RUNTIME_MOUNTS_DIR, ACCESS_TOKEN); reading token files from local paths.",
  "sinks": "Potentially insecure URL joins; token reading from local files and environment variables; setting authorization headers in requests session.",
  "flows": "Environment variables and file reads are source points; tokens are used in authorization headers; URLs constructed for network communication; tokens loaded into requests session.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function names and variable names that seem obfuscated or auto-generated; use of deprecated decorator without clear purpose; functions like wpXKlpVEpSCfkGWuFocFvyKkTkGigJzK have benign size formatting logic but no malicious behavior; no explicit data leaks or malicious code; environment-based URL and token handling could be misused if environment is compromised but are standard for environment variable usage.",
  "analysis": "The code contains various utility functions for formatting sizes, retrieving environment info, constructing URLs based on environment variables, and loading tokens from files or environment variables. There are no signs of malicious payloads, such as data exfiltration, network communication to suspicious domains, or backdoors. Obfuscated naming might suggest attempts at hiding intent, but functionally they are benign. The token retrieval logic and URL construction are standard practices but could be misused if the environment is compromised. Overall, the code appears to be legitimate utility code with no explicit malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is primarily utility functions for environment info, URL construction, and token handling with no direct evidence of malicious behavior. Obfuscated variable names and functions are noted but do not inherently imply malicious intent. No malicious payloads or backdoors are identified. The code could be exploited if environment variables or token files are compromised, but this is typical for environment-dependent applications. Overall, low suspicion of malware.",
