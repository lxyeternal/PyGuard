It reads tokens from files or environment variables and sets up HTTP sessions with authorization headers. The URL-building functions depend on environment variables, which could be manipulated, but no immediate malicious behavior is evident. No code explicitly performs malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communications to suspicious domains. The use of deprecated decorators and non-descriptive function names suggest obfuscation or poor coding practices but do not necessarily indicate malicious intent. Overall, no malicious behavior is detected, but the configuration and token handling could be misused if environment variables are compromised.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code mainly manages environment-based configuration for API access, including tokens and URLs. It does not contain malicious logic such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network abuse. The usage of environment variables and token files is typical for API client setup but could pose security risks if misconfigured. There is no evidence of malware or malicious intent within this module.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.8,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0.2,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.3\n}",
