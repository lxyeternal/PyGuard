  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate utility for astronomical data access, with obfuscation that could be used to conceal malicious intent but currently shows no evidence of malicious activity. The supply chain risk is low, but obfuscation and environment-dependent tokens should be reviewed for maintainability and security best practices."
