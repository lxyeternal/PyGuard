{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to access astronomical data services, specifically for retrieving data links and service URLs based on data releases and environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'RSP_SITE_TYPE', function parameters (ObsCoreRecord), external modules (pyvo, utils), and environment variables for URL security.",
  "sinks": "External URL creation with potential security tokens, environment variables, and data retrieval functions that may interact with external data sources.",
  "flows": "The environment variable 'RSP_SITE_TYPE' influences the control flow and URL construction; the URL and security token flow from functions like cAqEnFcDGmDhmdWdhdkwjvuvHoHCJUSb() to URL security setup; data flows from ObsCoreRecord.getdataurl() to DatalinkResults.from_result_url().",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated utility functions (cAqEnFcDGmDhmdWdhdkwjvuvHoHCJUSb, vLQZUrgXfvPtqDbSWMYfBNhYwngoFWTN) without clear purpose; environment variable check for 'RSP_SITE_TYPE' is strict but typical; no hardcoded credentials or suspicious string patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code checks an environment variable to determine access levels, constructs service URLs dynamically, and adds security tokens if available. The obfuscated utility functions are unusual but not inherently malicious; they could be for configuration or security purposes. The URL security setup appears standard, with no suspicious or malicious behaviors detected. No indications of data exfiltration, malicious code injection, or backdoors are present. The obfuscation may hinder code readability but does not suggest malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate data access layer for astronomical data services with some obfuscated utility functions. There are no signs of malware, malicious behavior, or supply chain attacks. The use of environment variables and dynamic URL configuration is typical for such services. Overall, it seems safe but could benefit from clearer, non-obfuscated code for maintainability.",
