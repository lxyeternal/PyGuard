{
  "purpose": "Provides utility functions for accessing and managing TAP services and jobs in an astronomical data context, including deprecated functions for backward compatibility.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration from function arguments, imports modules, and reads data from external API endpoints via HTTP requests (e.g., in XVLhieTNucXVGcZWpnYtGRDGFEcpdtCN).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes or returns data structures, invokes external services, or API calls; no evident untrusted data sinks with malicious intent.",
  "flows": "Input parameters like 'query_url' and optional 'n' influence API requests; external API responses are parsed and processed, with no dangerous data flows observed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking variable names and functions, possibly for concealment; deprecated functions redirect to internal service, but no harmful behavior detected; code appears intentionally obscured but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code imports known modules and uses warning suppression, with deprecated functions maintaining backward compatibility. The functions manage access to TAP services, including selecting service types and fetching job statuses asynchronously. No hardcoded secrets or credentials are evident. The API calls seem to be standard, with response parsing via xmltodict, and no suspicious data flows or dangerous operations are present. Obfuscated variable names suggest code concealment but do not indicate malicious activity. The overall structure indicates typical application logic for service access and data retrieval, with some obfuscation possibly for obfuscation's sake.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate utility module for managing TAP services, with some obfuscation and deprecated function handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks is detected based on this analysis. The code functions as intended without evident security concerns.",
