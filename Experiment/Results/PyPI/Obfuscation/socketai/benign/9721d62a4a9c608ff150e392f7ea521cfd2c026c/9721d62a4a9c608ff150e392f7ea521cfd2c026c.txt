Overall, the code appears safe for use, with obfuscation being the primary concern but not indicative of malicious behavior."

There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or malware, but the obfuscation and external dependencies should be flagged for further validation and validation of environment variables. Proper sanitization, validation, and clearer code structure are recommended to mitigate potential supply chain or runtime risks."

The current scores are appropriate given the limited context; however, the main risk hinges on the behavior of 'LabRunner().go()'. Without inspecting its implementation, the code cannot be definitively classified as malicious. Further analysis of 'LabRunner' is recommended to clarify potential security implications."
