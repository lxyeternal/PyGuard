  "purpose": "To extend the module search path for package modules using pkgutil.",
  "sources": "The line importing 'pkgutil' and the use of '__path__' and '__name__' variables.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output mechanisms observed.",
  "flows": "Imports 'pkgutil' -> Extends '__path__' with 'pkgutil.extend_path' using '__name__' as argument.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious constructs detected. The code is minimal and standard for package path extension.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the standard library 'pkgutil' to modify the '__path__' variable, which is used in Python packages to define the locations where modules are searched. The use of 'pkgutil.extend_path' is a legitimate pattern for namespace packages. No external input, no obfuscated code, nor any malicious patterns are present. The code appears to be a typical package setup snippet.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard implementation for extending a package's search path in Python and does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks.",
