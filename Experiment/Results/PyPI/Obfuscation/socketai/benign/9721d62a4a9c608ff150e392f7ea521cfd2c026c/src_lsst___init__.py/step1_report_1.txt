  "purpose": "Extend the module's search path for package resources.",
  "sources": "Importing 'pkgutil' module and extending __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks present; no untrusted data handling or output.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; code simply modifies __path__.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual behavior. Use of __path__ extension is standard in package resource management.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and extends the '__path__' variable using 'pkgutil.extend_path'. This is a common pattern in Python packages that support namespace packages, allowing the package to include resources from multiple locations. There are no signs of malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, code injection, or backdoors. The code is straightforward and adheres to standard package practices.",
  "conclusion": "This code is benign and typical for Python namespace packages. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks.",
