  "purpose": "Extend the package path for namespace package support.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading operations present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths identified, as the code simply extends the package path.",
  "anomalies": "Minimal code, no suspicious or unusual behaviors observed. The use of pkgutil.extend_path is a standard technique for namespace packages.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the 'pkgutil' module and uses 'extend_path' to modify the '__path__' variable, which is a common pattern for supporting namespace packages in Python. There are no inputs, outputs, or data handling, and no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The code is minimal and serves a specific purpose related to package structure.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard and non-malicious, intended to support namespace packages. No security concerns or malicious behavior detected.",
