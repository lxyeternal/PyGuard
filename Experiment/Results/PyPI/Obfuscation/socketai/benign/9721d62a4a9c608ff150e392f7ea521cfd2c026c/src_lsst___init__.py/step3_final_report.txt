  "purpose": "Support namespace package extension by extending __path__ with pkgutil.extend_path.",
  "sources": "Import of pkgutil module, usage of __path__ variable.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data, output, or side effects.",
  "flows": "Import pkgutil -> extend __path__ -> assign to __path__.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is minimal, standard, and straightforward.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the pkgutil module and extends the __path__ variable using pkgutil.extend_path, a common pattern for namespace packages. It involves no data input/output, no obfuscated or malicious code, and no suspicious constructs. The code's purpose is to support namespace package distribution across multiple directories. All reports correctly identify this pattern as benign, with no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security risks. The scores assigned (malware: 0, obfuscated: 0, risk: 0) are consistent and justified given the code's simplicity and purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign pattern used in Python namespace packages. There is no malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security risk present. The reports and scores are accurate and appropriate.",
