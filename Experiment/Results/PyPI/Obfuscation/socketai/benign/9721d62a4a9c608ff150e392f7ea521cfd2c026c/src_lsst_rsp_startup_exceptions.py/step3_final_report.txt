{
  "purpose": "The code defines custom exception classes for subprocess and OS error handling, with heavily obfuscated variable and class names, primarily serving as structured error reporting utilities.",
  "sources": "Error handling routines capturing subprocess args, exception details, error codes, and environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Error message formatting and exception attribute assignments; no external data sources or untrusted inputs beyond standard exception objects.",
  "flows": "Input data from exceptions flows into formatted messages and error code mappings within the custom exception classes.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and class names, complex logic in error handling, inconsistent attribute references (e.g., non-standard attributes like 'CdHOWabwrkBbLeINyjQoepVrCTMECRfp'), which may hinder analysis but do not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is syntactically correct and functions as a structured error handling utility. No network activity, data exfiltration, command injection, or malicious payloads are present. The obfuscation appears to be an intentional tactic to conceal complexity rather than malicious behavior. The error handling logic is standard, mapping error codes and formatting messages. The suspicious attribute names and convoluted logic suggest obfuscation rather than malicious intent. No vulnerabilities or malicious actions are evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of obfuscated error handling classes with no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The obfuscation is likely intended to hinder analysis but does not constitute a security threat based on this snippet. The malware score remains 0, obfuscation score high (~0.8), and overall security risk low (~0.2).",
