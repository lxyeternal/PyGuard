{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes and error handling for subprocess execution and OS errors, with some obfuscation in variable names.",
  "sources": "Input sources include exception objects (subprocess.CalledProcessError, subprocess.TimeoutExpired, OSError), and potentially external environment variables indirectly via error handling.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are raising exceptions with detailed error messages; error handling logic may process error codes and messages.",
  "flows": "Error objects are instantiated with data from subprocess errors or OS errors; error attributes are used to generate messages. No data flows to external systems or network.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names throughout (e.g., xAfTrCtndanLUkipavVVsYviThGxUbyY), inconsistent naming, and complex logic in error handling classes, indicating potential obfuscation. No direct evidence of malicious actions like network calls, data exfiltration, or backdoors.",
  "analysis": "The code mainly defines exception classes with obfuscated internal variable names, likely to hinder analysis. Error handling extracts error codes and messages from system or subprocess errors, but no suspicious behavior or external communications are present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious commands. The obfuscation appears to be intended to conceal complexity or intent but does not show malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a set of custom exception classes with obfuscated variable names, used for structured error handling. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks is observed. The obfuscation could be benign or designed to hide complexity, but based solely on this code, it appears non-malicious.",
