  "purpose": "Invoke the 'go' method of the 'LabRunner' class imported from '.services.labrunner'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module '.services.labrunner', invocation of 'LabRunner().go()'.",
  "sinks": "Execution of 'LabRunner().go()', which may execute code within the 'go' method.",
  "flows": "Import of 'LabRunner' -> instantiation of 'LabRunner' object -> call to 'go()' method.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual function name 'ZZbxViKUfTJAffOhtcUuJaRJKzNUzmKm' that appears obfuscated or randomly generated, but no suspicious code patterns are visible within the snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a class 'LabRunner' from a local module, then defines a function with an obfuscated name that calls the 'go()' method of 'LabRunner'. No hardcoded secrets, environment variables, or suspicious behaviors are evident. The use of an obfuscated function name suggests possible concealment, but without additional context or implementation details of 'LabRunner' or 'go()', it's not possible to determine malicious intent. The code is straightforward in its structure, with no apparent malicious patterns in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code simply calls a method from a local class, with no evident malicious behavior. The obfuscated function name warrants caution, but no malicious or security-threatening activity can be confirmed from this fragment alone.",
