  "purpose": "This code implements a chatbot plugin that responds with random probabilities or numbers, processes user commands related to rolling or probability, and handles some keyword filtering.",
  "sources": "Input is read from user messages via 'extract_plain_text' methods and from a JSON file ('words.json') that contains a list of words. Environment variables or external inputs are not directly used.",
  "sinks": "Outputs are generated as text messages sent via 'UniMessage.text'. There are no system or network calls that send data elsewhere. No file writes, system commands, or network communications are observed.",
  "flows": "User input is processed through regex and string matching to generate responses or filter out certain words, then responses are sent back as text messages. No data flows to external systems or untrusted sinks beyond message replies.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains hardcoded sensitive-looking strings such as words ['打胶', '傻逼']. There are no evident malicious backdoors, hidden network calls, or code injection mechanisms. The use of 'json.dump' and 'json.load' on a local file is standard. No obfuscated code or misleading variable names indicating malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code performs input normalization, word filtering, random number generation, and some similarity checks using difflib. It reads from a local JSON file, creating it if absent, with hardcoded words. User inputs are sanitized, checked against filter words, and then responded to with probabilities or random choices. No network connections, file modifications outside the local JSON, or system manipulations are evident. The presence of sensitive words in the static list is noted but does not indicate malicious activity. Overall, the code appears to be a benign chatbot plugin without malicious or sabotage behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a chatbot plugin that provides random probability and parameter responses with word filtering. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The static word list and normal operations do not indicate sabotage. The overall security posture is safe.",
