  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, configuring package metadata and dependencies.",
  "sources": "Reads 'README.md' file for long description.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows detected.",
  "flows": "Reads README content; passes static metadata to setuptools.setup().",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; superficial obfuscation without malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup.py script with obfuscated variable names, which reduces readability but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. No dynamic code execution, network activity, or suspicious logic is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, limited to variable names, and the dependencies are legitimate for a NoneBot plugin. The reports provided are empty, containing no details or findings, making it impossible to identify vulnerabilities or malicious activity. Given the lack of evidence, the code is benign, and the obfuscation does not suggest malicious intent. Scores should reflect low risk and malware likelihood.",
  "conclusion": "The package setup code is standard with superficial obfuscation. No malicious activity or vulnerabilities are evident. The empty reports do not provide additional concerns. Overall, the package is low risk, with a malware score of 0, obfuscation score around 0.2, and risk score near 0.1.",
