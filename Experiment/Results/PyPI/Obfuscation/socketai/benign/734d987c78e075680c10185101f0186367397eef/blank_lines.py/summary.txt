  "conclusion": "Based on the code snippet and the provided reports, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscation is superficial, and the regex operations are benign. The external function's behavior remains unknown, but no malicious activity can be inferred from this context. The malware score is set to 0, and the security risk score is low (0.2), reflecting minimal threat. Overall, the code appears to be a benign utility for text formatting with superficial obfuscation."
