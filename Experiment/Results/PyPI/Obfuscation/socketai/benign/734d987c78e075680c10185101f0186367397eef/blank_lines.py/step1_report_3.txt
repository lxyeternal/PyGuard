{
  "purpose": "The code appears to process text data, possibly for formatting or cleaning purposes, by adding or removing comment tokens and blank lines.",
  "sources": "The functions accept input data as parameters, which are processed through regex substitutions; the source is the function input variables.",
  "sinks": "The output of the regex substitutions, which could modify input data or code, potentially affecting code formatting or structure.",
  "flows": "Input data is passed to functions (e.g., FUuEWGwKAyKBsvQLzTDbuGrISxRntiAj, MDpiCNBlyKjgENbrYECglHinbjqlCNoa) -> processed with regex substitutions in BXMfNUvQmqQnvjSKbRihMyrbaTmKFwuJ and qnYefWkDWIatrSOrSQUTVLlDOUKcOkDe.",
  "anomalies": "Use of dynamic regex patterns and string substitution could be misused for obfuscation or code injection if input data is untrusted; no explicit hardcoded secrets observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports external modules and calls functions that perform regex substitutions on input text, replacing specific newline and comment patterns. The functions seem to normalize or reformat text, possibly for code processing. The use of regex with dynamic patterns and referencing external constants suggests potential for misuse if inputs are not sanitized. No explicit malicious actions, such as network activity or file system access, are present. The code's purpose appears to be text or code formatting, not malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs regex-based text modifications that could be part of a larger code processing pipeline. No malicious intent or malware behaviors are evident; the code appears benign but should be reviewed in context to ensure inputs are sanitized.",
