  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for AST analysis and formatting with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation level warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, with the obfuscation score reflecting the variable naming complexity."
