{
  "purpose": "The code performs AST traversal and analysis, likely for code formatting or static analysis purposes, utilizing obfuscated variable names and constants.",
  "sources": "AST nodes, attributes like 'children', 'get_first_leaf()', and imported constants with obscure names.",
  "sinks": "Internal modifications of AST node attributes, regex matching for indentation, no external data or network activity.",
  "flows": "Traversal from parent AST nodes to child nodes, with conditional modifications based on node types and indentation markers.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated variable and class names, broad exception handling, undefined variables such as 'MAX_CHARACTERS_TO_FIND_INDENTATION_PARENT' and 'leaf', imported constants with non-descriptive names.",
  "analysis": "The code is an AST processing utility that traverses and modifies nodes, detects indentation markers, and handles formatting flags. The obfuscation suggests concealment or code generation but does not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The broad exception handling and undefined variables point to either incomplete or intentionally obfuscated code, but these do not imply malicious behavior. The overall structure and purpose align with static analysis or formatting tools, not malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a utility for AST analysis and formatting with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise. The high obfuscation level warrants caution but does not indicate malicious intent. The security risk and malware scores are appropriately low, with the obfuscation score reflecting the variable naming complexity.",
