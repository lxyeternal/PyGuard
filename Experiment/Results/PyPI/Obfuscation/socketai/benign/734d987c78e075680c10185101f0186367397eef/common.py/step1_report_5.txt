{
  "purpose": "The code appears to perform static analysis or transformation on Python AST nodes, possibly for code formatting or analysis tools.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from AST Module objects, leaf nodes of code structure, and function parameters for text processing.",
  "sinks": "Potentially unsafe operations include regex search and manipulation of code nodes, but no direct data leaks or dangerous actions are evident.",
  "flows": "Code reads AST nodes and their properties, applies regex matching, and modifies attributes related to formatting control flags.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of many obfuscated variable names, imported constants with unclear purpose, and the use of pattern matching functions that could be misused in different contexts.",
  "analysis": "The code is mainly focused on traversing and manipulating AST nodes for Python code. It includes a class for filtering nodes based on type and formatting directives, a function to modify node properties, and functions to locate specific code positions or extract indentation. There are no indications of malicious behavior such as network access, data exfiltration, or code injection. The obfuscated naming could be suspicious but may be for code concealment or generated code. The use of regex to match indentation is standard and not malicious. The overall structure suggests a static code analysis or formatting utility, with no malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a static analysis utility for Python AST nodes, with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The obfuscated variable names raise minor concern but are likely for code concealment. There are no network operations, data leaks, or system modifications observed. Overall, the package appears safe, with a low malware score.",
