{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class with various string constants and some list/tuple variables, along with a few integer constants and string messages.",
  "sources": "No input sources or data reads are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data outputs are present in the code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks is observable.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains multiple cryptic variable and class names, which might be considered obfuscated or intentionally obscure. The list variables and constants do not have clear contextual meaning. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or suspicious operations are evident. No network, file, or environment interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of an Enum class with unusual and opaque naming conventions, plus several variables that are simple lists, tuples, integers, and strings. The class and variable names do not suggest any malicious purpose. No functions, input/output operations, or external interactions are present. The code appears to be a standard data structure definition, possibly auto-generated or intentionally obfuscated, but without any malicious logic or malicious intent detected.",
  "conclusion": "There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this code fragment. It appears to be a benign, possibly obfuscated, data definition module. No suspicious activities or security concerns are evident.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
