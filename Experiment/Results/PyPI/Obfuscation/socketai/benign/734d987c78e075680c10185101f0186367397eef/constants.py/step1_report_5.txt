{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration class with various constants and associated data structures, likely for internal use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "Class and variable definitions; no external input or data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks identified; no untrusted data handling or output operations present.",
  "flows": "No data flows involving untrusted input to sensitive operations; all data are constants or class attributes.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code behavior observed. The use of many seemingly random variable names and strings appears to be obfuscated or auto-generated but does not inherently suggest malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily consists of an Enum class with multiple constants and some variables holding lists, strings, and integers. There are no input/output operations, network connections, or system modifications. Variable names are non-descriptive and appear obfuscated, but this alone does not indicate malicious activity. The code lacks any dynamic execution, suspicious imports beyond standard library, or side effects. It appears to be configuration or constants used within a larger system without evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code, there is no indication of malicious intent, malicious code, or security risks. The code appears to be benign, possibly auto-generated or obfuscated configuration data.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.8,
