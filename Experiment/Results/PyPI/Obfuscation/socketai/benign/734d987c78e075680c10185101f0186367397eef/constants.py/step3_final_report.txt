{
  "purpose": "Static definitions of an Enum class with obfuscated member names and several module-level variables, likely for configuration or categorization purposes.",
  "sources": "Class enum members, module-level variables (lists, tuples, integers, Path object)",
  "sinks": "None; no data flows to external systems or untrusted sources",
  "flows": "N/A; static data definitions only",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and class names, inclusion of emoticons in string constants, no functional code or data processing",
  "analysis": "The code is purely static, defining an Enum and some constants with obscure names. No functions, input/output, network activity, or dynamic code execution are present. The obfuscation appears intentional but does not indicate malicious intent. The absence of code injection, data exfiltration, or system modifications suggests no active threats. The obfuscated naming is consistent with configuration or placeholder data, not malicious payloads.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as static configuration or constants with obfuscated names. No malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities are evident. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware and security risk scores should remain at 0 and very low, respectively.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0.75,
