  "conclusion": "The code functions as a static code analysis and formatting utility with obfuscated components. No evidence of malicious activity or supply chain compromise is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not justify high malware or security risk scores. Overall, the code appears low risk with moderate obfuscation."
