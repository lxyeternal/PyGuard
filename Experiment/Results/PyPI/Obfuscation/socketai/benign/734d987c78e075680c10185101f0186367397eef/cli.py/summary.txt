  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate, if obfuscated, code analysis and reformatting utility. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or network communication. The obfuscation and external dependencies warrant caution but do not confirm malicious intent. The overall malware risk is low (~0.1), with high obfuscation (~0.8) and moderate security risk (~0.3). Continued scrutiny of external modules is advised before deployment in sensitive environments."
