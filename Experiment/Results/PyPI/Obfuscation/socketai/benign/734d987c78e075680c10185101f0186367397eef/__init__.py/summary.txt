  "conclusion": "The provided scores are generally justified and aligned with the analysis. Benign code is correctly scored with low malware and risk. Suspicious code with obfuscation and dynamic execution receives higher scores, appropriately indicating potential threat without confirmed malicious payloads. No adjustments are necessary unless further code details reveal explicit malicious behavior."
