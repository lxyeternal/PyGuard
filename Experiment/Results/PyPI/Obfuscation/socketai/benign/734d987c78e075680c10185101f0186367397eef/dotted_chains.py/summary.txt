  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a utility for code analysis, formatting, or obfuscation rather than malicious activity. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the lack of evidence for malicious payloads suggests a low malware risk. The overall security risk remains moderate due to obfuscation potential but is not actively malicious."
