{
  "purpose": "Fetches podcast data from Listen Notes API using an API key stored in environment variables.",
  "sources": "Reads API key from environment variable; makes API request via third-party library; processes response data.",
  "sinks": "Prints JSON response and headers; no data exfiltration or network anomalies observed.",
  "flows": "Environment variable -> API client initialization -> API request -> Response handling and printing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no hardcoded secrets; no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with the Listen Notes API to retrieve podcast info, handling expected exceptions. Obfuscated variable names reduce readability but do not indicate malicious intent. No malicious code, data leaks, or harmful operations are present. The obfuscation is moderate and likely intended to hinder understanding but does not suggest sabotage or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate API client with moderate obfuscation. No evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The security risk is low, and the obfuscation score reflects readability concerns rather than malicious intent.",
