  "purpose": "Retrieve podcast information from Listen Notes API using an API key stored in environment variables.",
  "sources": "Environment variable 'LISTEN_API_KEY'; API response from 'podcast_api' methods",
  "sinks": "Printing JSON output and API response headers which contain usage and quota info",
  "flows": "API key read from environment variable -> API request -> Output of response data and headers",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials; API key stored in environment variable, which is standard; no obfuscated code or suspicious patterns; no data exfiltration or system manipulation observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports required modules and retrieves an API key from environment variables, which is good practice. It initializes the podcast API client with this key. It then attempts to fetch podcast data using a specific endpoint with query parameters. Multiple exception handlers catch various API-related errors and print user-friendly messages. In the 'else' block, it accesses response headers like 'X-ListenAPI-FreeQuota', 'X-ListenAPI-Usage', and 'X-Listenapi-NextBillingDate', which are used to display account usage info. The overall logic appears straightforward, with no signs of malicious code such as data theft, system compromise, or malicious network activity.",
  "conclusion": "The script performs a legitimate API call to retrieve and display podcast data and account info. There are no indications of malicious behavior, backdoors, data exfiltration, or malicious intent. The code follows standard practices for API interaction and error handling. The overall security risk is minimal.",
