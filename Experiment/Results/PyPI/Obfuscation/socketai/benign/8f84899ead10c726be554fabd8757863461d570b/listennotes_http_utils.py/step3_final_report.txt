  "purpose": "Obfuscated Python class acting as a wrapper for the Listen Notes API, managing HTTP sessions and providing methods for various HTTP verbs with detailed error handling.",
  "sources": "Method parameters, kwargs, environment variables, and session attributes used to configure request headers, adapters, and other session settings.",
  "sinks": "Network requests to external API endpoints, error handling that may leak request details or error info, dynamic attribute setting on the session object.",
  "flows": "Input parameters and kwargs flow into request configurations, which are executed via the session; errors are caught and converted into custom exceptions.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and method names, dynamic attribute assignment based on kwargs, no hardcoded secrets or credentials, standard error handling, no suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an obfuscated API client wrapper for Listen Notes, managing a requests.Session with configurable adapters and attributes. It provides methods for HTTP verbs, handling errors with detailed exceptions. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present. Obfuscation may be for concealment but does not inherently indicate malicious intent. The code appears legitimate, with no signs of data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated API client wrapper with no evidence of malicious activity. Obfuscation is the primary concern but does not imply malicious intent. The malware score is 0, security risk is low (~0.2), and obfuscation is high (~0.75).",
