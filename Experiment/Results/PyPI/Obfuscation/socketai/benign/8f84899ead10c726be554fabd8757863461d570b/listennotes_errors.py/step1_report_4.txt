{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, some of which inherit from a base exception class, potentially for use in larger codebases.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance structures; no external input sources present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leak points detected; no untrusted data processing or output functions.",
  "flows": "Inheritance relationships; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed.",
  "anomalies": "Class names and variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, which could be used to hide malicious intent. No meaningful logic or external interactions are present.",
  "analysis": "The code solely consists of several custom exception classes with obfuscated names and inheritance from a base exception class. The __init__ method stores parameters, and __str__ returns a message. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external communications. The obfuscation and lack of functional behavior suggest attempts to hide malicious activity or mislead code reviewers. The code itself does not perform any harmful actions, but its obfuscated nature could be used to conceal malicious behavior in a larger context.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated exception classes with no immediate malicious behavior. However, the obfuscation could be used to hide malicious intent or integrate malicious logic elsewhere. The code alone is not harmful but warrants caution due to its obfuscation and lack of clear purpose.",
