  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes, with some inheritance structure, for error handling.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and inheritance from a base exception class.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data flows to sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "Instantiation of custom exceptions and their inheritance hierarchy.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated, with nonsensical identifiers; no actual code logic beyond class definitions; no external data handling or operations.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions that inherit from a custom exception class. The class names appear intentionally obfuscated, likely to conceal purpose, but they do not perform any operations, data processing, or data handling. No input/output, external data reads, or dangerous functions are present. The classes do not execute code, call external systems, or handle sensitive data. The only unusual aspect is the obfuscated naming, which could suggest concealment, but without active code, no malicious behavior is evident. There are no sinks, flows, or anomalies indicating malicious intent beyond obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign in its current form, serving solely to define custom exception classes with obfuscated names. No malicious activity or security risks are identified within this code fragment.",
