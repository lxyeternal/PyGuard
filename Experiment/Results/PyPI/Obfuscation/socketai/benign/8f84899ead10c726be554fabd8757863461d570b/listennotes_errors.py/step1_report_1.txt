{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with inheritance hierarchy, possibly for use in a larger application.",
  "sources": "No external data inputs or user input are read in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data leaks are present; no untrusted data handling or output occurs.",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks; inheritance does not involve data transfer or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Class and variable names are obfuscated and nonsensical, suggesting deliberate obfuscation. No actual logic or functional code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code only defines several custom exception classes with obfuscated names. No executable logic, data handling, or external interactions are included. The classes inherit from each other, creating an inheritance hierarchy. The obfuscated naming and lack of operational code point to potential code obfuscation rather than malicious behavior. There are no signs of data leakage, malicious activity, or security risks within this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be obfuscated class definitions for custom exceptions, likely part of a larger, possibly intentionally obscured codebase. There are no indicators of malicious intent or security risks within this snippet.",
