{
  "purpose": "Defines multiple custom exception classes, inheriting from a base exception class, with no additional functionality beyond storing a message and an optional attribute.",
  "sources": "Class definitions and their __init__ and __str__ methods; no external data input or output observed.",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks or data flows involving untrusted input or external data outputs.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow is present in this code.",
  "anomalies": "Class names are obfuscated, which could suggest an attempt to hide purpose, but the code itself is straightforward and does not perform any suspicious actions.",
  "analysis": "The code only consists of class definitions for custom exceptions, with no logic, input handling, or external interactions. The classes store message data and a secondary attribute, but do not perform any malicious operations. The obfuscated class names could be a concern but are not inherently malicious. No code injection, data leakage, network activity, or other malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple set of obfuscated custom exception classes with no malicious intent. No suspicious or malicious behavior is detected.",
