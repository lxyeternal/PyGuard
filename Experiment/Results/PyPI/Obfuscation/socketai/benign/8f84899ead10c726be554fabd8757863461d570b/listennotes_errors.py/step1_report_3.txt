{
  "purpose": "Define custom exception classes with potential inheritance for specific error handling.",
  "sources": "No external data sources or inputs are read by this code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or output sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code solely defines classes.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated class names and variable names, which may indicate attempts to hide intent or make analysis difficult.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple custom exception classes inheriting from a base exception. All classes contain minimal implementation, mostly passing or returning message strings. There are no dynamic code executions, network calls, or data manipulations. The obfuscated naming may suggest an attempt to conceal functionality but does not indicate malicious behavior directly. No suspicious I/O, secrets, or malicious actions are present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a set of intentionally obfuscated class definitions for custom exceptions, with no evident malicious intent or security risks. The obfuscation might be intended to hinder analysis but does not necessarily imply malicious activity.",
