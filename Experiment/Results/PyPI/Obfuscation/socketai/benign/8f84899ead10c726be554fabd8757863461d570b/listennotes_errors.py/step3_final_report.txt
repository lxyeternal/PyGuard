{
  "purpose": "Defines custom exception classes with inheritance hierarchy, obfuscated class names, no logic or data flow.",
  "sources": "Class definitions with obfuscated names, no external input or data handling.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class inheritance structures.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and variable names, no operational code, no logic, no data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of class definitions for custom exceptions with obfuscated names, lacking any logic, data flow, or external interactions. The obfuscation suggests an attempt to conceal purpose but does not indicate malicious activity. No signs of malware, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores in reports appropriately reflect the benign nature, with high obfuscation scores and zero malware risk. The minimal security risk score is justified given the absence of active malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, obfuscated class definitions with no malicious intent or security risks. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious activity; in this context, the code appears to be intentionally obscured but harmless.",
