      "conclusion": "The code is a typical setup script with a notable security concern from the use of exec() on an external file. No evidence of malware or malicious intent is present. The obfuscation is superficial. The primary risk is if 'version.py' is tampered with, which could lead to arbitrary code execution. Scores are consistent with this assessment."

The obfuscation is moderate and likely intentional for testing or stylistic reasons. Overall, the supply chain security risk is minimal."
