  "purpose": "Assigns a version string to an obfuscated variable name, likely for dependency or version tracking.",
  "sources": "Variable assignment statement: RyeXzUaaubDkxRyHizEkgPpWdNHLJzyq = \"1.1.6\"",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted input, output, or data leaks present.",
  "flows": "Simple assignment; no data flow from untrusted sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable name; no other unusual behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a straightforward assignment of a version string to an obfuscated variable name. No inputs, outputs, network activity, or malicious operations are present. The obfuscation may be intentional or placeholder, but it does not indicate malicious intent. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk is minimal. Obfuscation suspicion is noted but not harmful in this context.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is benign, representing a simple version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. No malicious or security threats are evident. The current scores are appropriate; malware score remains 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall risk is negligible.",
