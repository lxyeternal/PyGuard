  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Variable name appears to be a random string, which is unusual but not necessarily malicious; no other suspicious activity detected.",
  "analysis": "The code assigns a version string '1.1.6' to a variable named 'RyeXzUaaubDkxRyHizEkgPpWdNHLJzyq'. The variable name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which can be a sign of obfuscation but may also be a placeholder or generated code. There are no inputs, network calls, or other actions indicating malicious intent. The code is minimal and straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not exhibit malicious behavior. The obfuscated variable name is suspicious but not harmful on its own. Overall security risk is low.",
