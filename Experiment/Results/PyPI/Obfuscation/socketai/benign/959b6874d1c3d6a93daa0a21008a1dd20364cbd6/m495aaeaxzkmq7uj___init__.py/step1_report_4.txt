  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "N/A",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable name; the variable name is obfuscated or non-descriptive. No other suspicious activity or code behavior observed.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single string assignment with a complex variable name, setting a version number '1.46.0'. The variable name appears intentionally obfuscated or auto-generated, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as code injection, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. No external input, no network calls, no credential handling. The content is benign and typical of version declaration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward version string assignment with an obfuscated variable name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks in this snippet.",
