  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SSR and static site generation utility employing browser automation and content caching. It shows obfuscation but no malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0.75, risk=0.2. It should be reviewed cautiously before deployment, especially regarding obfuscation, but no active threats are present."
