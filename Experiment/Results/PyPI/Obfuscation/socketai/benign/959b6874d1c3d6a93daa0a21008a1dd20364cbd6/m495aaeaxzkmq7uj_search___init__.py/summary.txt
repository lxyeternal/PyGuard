  "conclusion": "The dependency shows strong indicators of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior in Report 1, warranting a malware score of 0.65 and a high obfuscation score. Other reports are benign, with low scores. The overall security risk aligns with these findings. The scores are appropriate and reflect the evidence provided."
