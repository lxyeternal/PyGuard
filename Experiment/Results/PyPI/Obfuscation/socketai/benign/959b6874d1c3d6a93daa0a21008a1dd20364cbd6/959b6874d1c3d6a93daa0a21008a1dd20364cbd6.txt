      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate SSR and static site generation utility employing browser automation and content caching. It shows obfuscation but no malicious behavior. The scores are appropriate: malware=0, obfuscated=0.75, risk=0.2. It should be reviewed cautiously before deployment, especially regarding obfuscation, but no active threats are present."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, minimal version assignment with obfuscated variable naming. No evidence of malicious activity, data leakage, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious intent, and the security and malware scores are correctly assigned as zero. The obfuscated score is moderate (~0.6) to reflect the variable naming but does not imply threat."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign, albeit incomplete, licensing warning utility with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious activity or security threats. The main concern is the bug with the undefined 'name' variable, which should be fixed. The malware score remains 0, and the overall security risk is very low. The obfuscation level is moderate, but it does not imply malicious intent."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows strong indicators of obfuscation and potential malicious behavior in Report 1, warranting a malware score of 0.65 and a high obfuscation score. Other reports are benign, with low scores. The overall security risk aligns with these findings. The scores are appropriate and reflect the evidence provided."

      "conclusion": "The code is an obfuscated, configuration-dependent widget component with no direct malicious activity. The main security concern is reliance on external settings and obfuscation, which could be exploited if environment is compromised. Overall, it appears benign but should be monitored and validated."

Obfuscation scores are justified based on variable naming. Overall, the code poses no security threat."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard setup for user session management with obfuscated variable names, likely due to code generation or minification. There is no evidence of malware or malicious behavior. The current security risk is low, and the malware score is appropriate at 0. The obfuscation score could be slightly increased to reflect the obfuscated identifiers, but overall, the code is benign."

The primary concern is the undefined 'api_base_url', which could cause errors or be exploited. Obfuscation of variable names affects readability but does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible. Addressing the undefined variable and improving URL validation would strengthen security."
