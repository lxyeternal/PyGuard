  "purpose": "Manage web session data via signed cookies, ensuring integrity and optional security attributes.",
  "sources": "Cookies in HTTP request headers; session data loaded from cookie payload.",
  "sinks": "Setting 'Set-Cookie' headers in HTTP response to store session data.",
  "flows": "Cookie value read -> signature verification -> decode and load session -> modify session -> sign and set cookie in response.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious code, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation detected; standard practices used.",
  "analysis": "The code implements a standard session middleware using itsdangerous for signing session data stored in cookies. It verifies signatures, handles expiration, and tracks modifications via a custom dict subclass. No malicious activity, backdoors, or obfuscation are present. The signature verification is correctly handled with exception catching, and cookie attributes are configurable. The code does not contain hardcoded secrets, and the signing process relies on secrets provided at runtime. The overall structure is clear, with no suspicious external calls or data leaks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a secure, standard implementation of session management middleware with no signs of malicious intent or obfuscation. The assigned malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and low security risk (~0.1-0.2) are appropriate and consistent with the analysis.",
