{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be designed to issue a warning message about enterprise feature licensing.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input data; it primarily operates on function parameters and internal variables.",
  "sinks": "The print statement outputs to standard error; no untrusted data is being written to external systems.",
  "flows": "The function checks and updates a warning dictionary, then prints a warning message; no external data flows or processing beyond that.",
  "anomalies": "The variable 'name' used in the formatted string is undefined within the scope, which could cause a runtime error but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a warning tracking dictionary and a function that issues a license warning message. The function prevents duplicate warnings for the same input by tracking called parameters. No data is received from external sources, nor is there any attempt to read environment variables, secrets, or user input. The print statement outputs a message with no indication of malicious intent. The undefined 'name' variable suggests a bug rather than malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple warning mechanism with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The main concern is the undefined 'name' variable, which could cause errors but does not relate to security threats.",
