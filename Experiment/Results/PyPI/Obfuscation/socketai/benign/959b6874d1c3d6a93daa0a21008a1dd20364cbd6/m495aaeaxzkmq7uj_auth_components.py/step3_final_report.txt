  "purpose": "The code defines UI components for user profile display and menu interactions, utilizing license and auth modules for user info and license validation.",
  "sources": "Reads user info from auth module, input parameters for images and styling, license verification calls.",
  "sinks": "UI rendering with image URLs, icons, and buttons; no external data transmission or network activity observed.",
  "flows": "Data flows from auth/session data into UI components; no external data leaks or network calls.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names (e.g., NDfamYKNblSwZTXJrxHWPaDEJXjIpbOb), but no malicious code or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of UI components built with Solara and reacton.ipyvuetify, primarily for user profile and menu interactions. Obfuscated variable names are present but do not indicate malicious intent. There are no network calls, data exfiltration, or security vulnerabilities. License checks are standard. The obfuscation appears to be stylistic or structural rather than malicious. The code is benign, and no malicious behavior or supply chain attacks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign UI logic with obfuscated variable names but no malicious payloads or security issues. The malware score is correctly set to 0, and the security risk is low. Obfuscation scores are justified based on variable naming. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
