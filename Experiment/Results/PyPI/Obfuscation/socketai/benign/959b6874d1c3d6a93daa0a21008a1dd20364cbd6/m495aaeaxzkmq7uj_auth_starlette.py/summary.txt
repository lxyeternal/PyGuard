  "conclusion": "The code is a standard OAuth client implementation with no malicious activity detected. The primary concern is the undefined 'api_base_url', which could cause errors or be exploited. Obfuscation of variable names affects readability but does not imply malicious intent. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible. Addressing the undefined variable and improving URL validation would strengthen security."
