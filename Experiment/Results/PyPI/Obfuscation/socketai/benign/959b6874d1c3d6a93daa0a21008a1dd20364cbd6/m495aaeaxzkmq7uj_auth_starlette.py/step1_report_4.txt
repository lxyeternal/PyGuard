{
  "purpose": "This code implements OAuth-based authentication using Starlette and Authlib, including login, logout, and user info retrieval functions.",
  "sources": "Reads configuration settings, request session data, and OAuth token/user info from OAuth provider responses.",
  "sinks": "Stores OAuth tokens and user info in session; potential for sensitive data leakage if session is improperly secured.",
  "flows": "OAuth authorization redirect → authorization response handling → session storage of tokens/user info → user info retrieval.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets visible. The code performs standard OAuth flow. Use of dynamic URLs appears cautious but is not inherently malicious. No obfuscated code or suspicious patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code handles OAuth flows for authentication, managing tokens and user info securely through sessions. No evidence of malicious code such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or data theft. It does include dynamic URL handling but only within standard OAuth practices. No suspicious network calls or hidden behaviors detected.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard OAuth authentication implementation with no malicious intent or security breaches identified. It manages tokens and user sessions securely. Overall, it is a typical OAuth flow implementation without malicious or harmful behavior.",
