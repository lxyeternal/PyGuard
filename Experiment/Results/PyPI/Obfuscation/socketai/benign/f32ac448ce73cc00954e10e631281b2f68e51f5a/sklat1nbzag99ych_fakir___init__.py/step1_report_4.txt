{
  "purpose": "The code imports two modules, likely for data generation and prediction functionalities, indicating it is part of a larger application involving data processing.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules: '.fake_data_generator' and '.predict_number_of_row_from_conf'.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks, such as network calls, file writes, or system commands, are present in the code snippet.",
  "flows": "No flow of data from sources to sinks is observable in this snippet; it only shows import statements.",
  "anomalies": "Imports are from local modules with seemingly obfuscated class/function names (FqedJDjmdSWyqQsTowEgMqKasVDfycpz, cmJnIZPJZXCXElsnRfBmctokDlZDaURt), which could be an attempt at hiding purpose. No other suspicious code is present.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs import statements from local modules with obfuscated identifiers, which could indicate an attempt to hide functionality or simply be a code style. There are no evident malicious behaviors such as data exfiltration, network activity, or system manipulation. The lack of additional code limits the scope of analysis, but nothing here explicitly suggests malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on these import statements, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated names could be for code obscurity or protection, not necessarily malicious. No suspicious activity or security risks are apparent in this snippet.",
