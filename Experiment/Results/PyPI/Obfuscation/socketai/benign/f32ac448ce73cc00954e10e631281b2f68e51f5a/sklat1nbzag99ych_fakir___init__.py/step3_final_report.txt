  "purpose": "Import classes/functions from local modules with obfuscated names, likely for internal use or concealment.",
  "sources": "Import statements from local modules with obfuscated identifiers.",
  "sinks": "No data flows, data leaks, or external communications observed.",
  "flows": "N/A - only import statements, no runtime data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated or nonsensical class/function names; no other code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only import statements from local modules with obfuscated names, which is suspicious but not inherently malicious. No active code, data handling, network activity, or other indicators of malicious behavior are present. The obfuscation could be for code protection or concealment. The scores assigned in the reports are consistent with this assessment, with malware scores at zero or very low, and high obfuscation scores justified by the naming pattern. Risk scores are low, reflecting the absence of active threats or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with high obfuscation but no evidence of malicious activity. The scores are appropriate; further review of the imported modules' content is recommended for definitive assessment. Overall, the supply chain risk is minimal based on this snippet.",
