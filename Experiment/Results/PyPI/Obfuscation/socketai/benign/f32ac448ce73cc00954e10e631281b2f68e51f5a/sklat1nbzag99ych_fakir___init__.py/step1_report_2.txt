  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules for data generation and prediction tasks.",
  "sources": "The code imports modules from the same package directory, which could potentially read or process data internally.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file system, or external data output are present in these import statements.",
  "flows": "No active data flows are established in this snippet; it only imports classes/functions.",
  "anomalies": "Imported identifiers 'FqedJDjmdSWyqQsTowEgMqKasVDfycpz' and 'cmJnIZPJZXCXElsnRfBmctokDlZDaURt' appear as obfuscated or randomly generated names, which may indicate attempts to hide intent or malicious code. No other anomalies detected in the import statements.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from local modules, with obfuscated class/function names. No code execution, data handling, or network activity is visible here. The naming pattern suggests possible obfuscation, which could be a technique to hide malicious intent. However, with only import statements, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security issues at this point.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the limited snippet, the code appears to import potentially obfuscated classes or functions, which could be used for legitimate purposes or conceal malicious behavior. No immediate security risks are evident, but the obfuscated names warrant further review of the imported modules.",
