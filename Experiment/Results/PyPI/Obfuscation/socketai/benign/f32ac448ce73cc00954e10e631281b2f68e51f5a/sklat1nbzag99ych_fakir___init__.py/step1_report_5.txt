{
  "purpose": "The code imports specific classes or functions from two local modules, likely for data generation and prediction tasks.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: '.fake_data_generator' and '.predict_number_of_row_from_conf'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present in this snippet; no data is outputted or transmitted.",
  "flows": "No flow analysis possible from the given code; only import statements are present.",
  "anomalies": "The imported identifiers 'FqedJDjmdSWyqQsTowEgMqKasVDfycpz' and 'cmJnIZPJZXCXElsnRfBmctokDlZDaURt' are highly obfuscated or randomly named, which can be suspicious. No other unusual code behavior is visible.",
  "analysis": "The code only performs imports from local modules with obfuscated identifiers, which is unusual and may indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or sensitive data. There are no apparent data flows, external network connections, or execution of untrusted code. The use of such random names could be a red flag, but with the provided snippet, it remains unclear whether this is malicious or simply an obfuscation tactic. No malicious behavior, such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or network activity, is evident in this minimal code.",
  "conclusion": "This snippet is limited to import statements with obfuscated names, which on its own is not definitive evidence of malicious behavior. However, the obfuscation warrants caution, especially if part of a larger codebase. No malicious activity is explicitly evident from this fragment.",
