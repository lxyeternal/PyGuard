{
  "purpose": "This code imports two classes or functions from local modules, likely for data generation and prediction tasks within a larger project.",
  "sources": "Imports from local modules: .fake_data_generator and .predict_number_of_row_from_conf",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks such as network, file, or environment variable access observed in the provided snippet",
  "flows": "No active data flow observed; only import statements are present, so no source-to-sink flow is evident",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated or non-descriptive class/function names (e.g., FqedJDjmdSWyqQsTowEgMqKasVDfycpz, cmJnIZPJZXCXElsnRfBmctokDlZDaURt) which could be an attempt to conceal purpose; no other suspicious activity detected",
  "analysis": "The code only contains import statements from local modules with non-meaningful, obfuscated identifiers. No further logic, data handling, or external communication is present. The obfuscated names could suggest an attempt to hide the true intent, but based solely on this snippet, there is no clear malicious activity or security risk. Lack of code beyond imports limits further assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is limited to importing potentially obfuscated classes or functions from local modules. While the naming is unusual and could be an attempt at obfuscation, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this fragment. Further context would be needed for a more definitive assessment.",
