  "purpose": "Import specific classes or functions from local modules, likely part of a larger package or application.",
  "sources": "Imports from '.fake_data_generator' and '.predict_number_of_row_from_conf' modules",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data output operations present in the provided code",
  "flows": "Import statements do not establish data flow paths; they load modules/classes for use within the package",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class and module names like 'FqedJDjmdSWyqQsTowEgMqKasVDfycpz' and 'cmJnIZPJZXCXElsnRfBmctokDlZDaURt' which appear to be obfuscated or randomly generated",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of import statements from relative modules within the package. The class and function names are nonsensical or obfuscated, which is atypical for normal, benign code. However, these alone are not definitive evidence of malicious intent. No network activity, data leakage, or suspicious behavior is directly observable. The obfuscated names could be for code protection or for hiding functionality, but without more context, this is not conclusive. The code does not perform any operations, data handling, or external communications in this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is limited to import statements with obfuscated identifiers, which could be for legitimate reasons such as code protection or internal naming conventions. There is no evidence of malicious behavior based solely on this fragment. However, the obfuscated naming warrants caution if found in a package intended for public or security-sensitive use.",
