  "purpose": "Import a class or function named 'FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni' from a local SDK module",
  "sources": "Import statement from local module '.sdk'",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed",
  "flows": "Not applicable; import statement does not imply data flow or execution path",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming of the imported symbol, which appears obfuscated or auto-generated; no other code present to assess further",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement from a local SDK module, importing a symbol with an obfuscated name. No additional logic, data handling, or behavior is shown. The import could be legitimate if part of a larger codebase, but the symbol name's obscurity raises suspicion. No code execution, data processing, or network activity is evident in this fragment. The lack of context limits the ability to definitively determine malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on this import statement, there is no direct evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscated symbol name could be legitimate or a sign of concealment, but without further code or context, no malicious activity can be confirmed.",
