  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious primarily due to the obfuscated symbol name, which warrants further review. No direct evidence of malicious activity is present in this fragment. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Further investigation should focus on the 'sdk' module's contents and the usage context of the imported symbol to determine if malicious behavior exists."
