  "purpose": "Import a specific class or object from a local module named 'sdk'.",
  "sources": "The code reads from the local module 'sdk' to import 'FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni'.",
  "sinks": "No sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or external data flow is evident.",
  "flows": "The code imports a potentially obfuscated or intentionally named object from a local module; no data flow from untrusted sources is detected.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni' appears to be obfuscated or intentionally nonsensical, which is unusual and may indicate obfuscation or concealment. The module name is relative, which is typical but offers no suspicious activity by itself.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single import statement from a relative module, importing an object with a highly obfuscated or nonsensical name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, such as network activity, credential handling, or code execution. The obfuscated name raises suspicion but is not conclusive without further context. No data flows or suspicious patterns are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "This code snippet is a simple import statement with an obfuscated object name. While the naming raises suspicion, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risk based solely on this line. Further context from the rest of the code would be necessary for a definitive assessment.",
