  "purpose": "Import a class or function named 'FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni' from a local module 'sdk'.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a relative module 'sdk'.",
  "sinks": "No apparent sinks; code does not process data or perform actions that lead to data leaks or execution flow based on untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Not enough code to determine any data flow; only an import statement present.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name 'FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni' appears as a randomly generated or obfuscated string, which is suspicious and may indicate an attempt to hide malicious intent or obfuscate malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code only contains a single import statement from a relative module. The imported symbol name is a long, nonsensical string, which is commonly used in obfuscation or to conceal malicious code. No other code, data inputs, or logic are present to evaluate further. The context suggests possible obfuscation, but without additional code, malicious behavior cannot be confirmed. The presence of an unusual symbol name warrants caution, but no concrete malicious actions are identifiable at this stage.",
  "conclusion": "The code snippet is minimal but suspicious due to the obfuscated import name. It may be part of a larger codebase where malicious activity is hidden, but based solely on this fragment, there is no definitive malicious behavior. The overall security risk is low to moderate pending further code review.",
