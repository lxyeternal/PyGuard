  "purpose": "Import a class or function named FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni from a local sdk module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module (relative import).",
  "sinks": "No evident sinks where untrusted data is processed or output.",
  "flows": "No flow of data from sources to sinks is present in this single line.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which could be suspicious. The code contains only an import statement without any additional context or functionality.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of a relative import of a potentially obfuscated or randomly named component from a local module named sdk. There are no other code elements, no input handling, no data processing, and no visible malicious actions. The import name is unusual, which could suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent. However, without additional code, it is impossible to definitively identify malicious behavior. The minimal code does not perform any harmful actions by itself but warrants further review of the sdk module content to confirm safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is a simple import statement with an obfuscated identifier. There is no immediate evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscated naming raises suspicion. Further investigation of the sdk module is recommended to rule out malicious code or backdoors.",
