  "purpose": "Assess the security implications of importing an obfuscated symbol from a local module, focusing on potential malicious behavior or sabotage in the context of supply chain security.",
  "sources": "Import statement importing 'FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni' from the local 'sdk' module.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external interactions are present in this code fragment; potential concerns relate to the usage of the imported symbol elsewhere.",
  "flows": "Import source (local module 'sdk') → symbol 'FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni' → subsequent code that may utilize this symbol.",
  "anomalies": "The imported symbol name appears highly obfuscated or randomly generated, indicating potential concealment or malicious intent; code contains only this import statement with no further logic.",
  "analysis": "The code snippet is minimal, consisting solely of an import statement of an obfuscated symbol from a local module. All reports correctly identify the suspicious nature of the symbol name, which suggests obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity, data leakage, or external network interaction is present within this fragment. The scores assigned by the reports reflect high suspicion due to naming (obfuscated score ~0.8), but low likelihood of malware (score ~0.2), and moderate security risk (~0.3). These scores are consistent with the cautious stance that obfuscation alone warrants further review but does not confirm malicious intent. The main concern is the potential for the symbol to be used maliciously elsewhere, which requires further investigation of the 'sdk' module and how this symbol is employed in the larger codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is suspicious primarily due to the obfuscated symbol name, which warrants further review. No direct evidence of malicious activity is present in this fragment. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Further investigation should focus on the 'sdk' module's contents and the usage context of the imported symbol to determine if malicious behavior exists.",
