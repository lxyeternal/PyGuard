  "purpose": "Import a class or function named FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni from a local module 'sdk'.",
  "sources": "The source is the import statement, which reads a symbol from a local module file 'sdk'.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks are present in this snippet; the imported object may be used elsewhere.",
  "flows": "The import makes the symbol available in the current module for further use; no data flow analysis can be performed from this single line.",
  "anomalies": "The imported name 'FZPbODjhryeFizzwLHFhVbuPADfTqnni' appears to be a randomly generated or obfuscated identifier, which could be suspicious or an attempt to hide malicious intent. The module 'sdk' is a common name but without context, the import alone is benign but warrants caution due to the obfuscated symbol.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only an import statement from a local module 'sdk'. The imported symbol has a non-descriptive, seemingly random name, which could be an indicator of obfuscation or malicious intent. No additional code is provided to analyze further behavior, such as execution or data handling. The presence of an obfuscated symbol alone does not confirm malicious behavior but raises suspicion, especially in the context of a supply chain review.",
  "conclusion": "This single import statement introduces an obfuscated symbol from a local module. While it does not directly demonstrate malicious activity, the obfuscated naming pattern is suspicious and warrants further review of the 'sdk' module and subsequent usage of the imported symbol to determine intent. No definitive malicious behavior is identifiable from this line alone.",
