{
  "purpose": "The code deserializes data using joblib.load, manipulates traceback frames, globals, and locals, and deletes files after loading, indicating potential malicious intent through unsafe deserialization and runtime data manipulation.",
  "sources": "Untrusted byte streams or files loaded via joblib.load, data from function arguments, and traceback frame attributes.",
  "sinks": "Deserialization process, manipulation of traceback frames, globals, locals, and file deletion, which could lead to code execution, data leakage, or concealment.",
  "flows": "Input data → joblib.load → deserialization → manipulation of traceback frames and globals → potential code execution or data exfiltration; files loaded then deleted to hide traces.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy reliance on untrusted deserialization without validation, complex variable names, manipulation of internal runtime structures, and immediate file deletion after loading.",
  "analysis": "The code performs unsafe deserialization via joblib.load from untrusted sources, which can execute arbitrary code. It manipulates traceback frames and global/local variables, potentially for malicious purposes such as code injection or data exfiltration. The obfuscated variable names and complex runtime manipulations suggest an intent to hide malicious activity. The immediate deletion of files after loading indicates an attempt to conceal traces. No explicit network activity is observed, but the deserialization vector itself is a significant security risk.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits behaviors consistent with malicious payload loaders, including unsafe deserialization, runtime manipulation, and obfuscation. It should be considered high risk, with a high probability of malicious intent, especially if used with untrusted data sources.",
