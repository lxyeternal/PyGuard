  "conclusion": "The analyzed code is a standard date feature extraction utility with significant obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware risk remains negligible. The code appears benign, and the security risk is minimal, primarily due to obfuscation rather than malicious behavior."
