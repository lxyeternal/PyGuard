  "conclusion": "The package exhibits high obfuscation and suspicious dynamic execution, indicating likely malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.6 and obfuscated score of 0.8. Other reports are benign with scores of zero. Overall, the security risk is moderate to high for the suspicious package, and low for others. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis."
