  "purpose": "Analyze open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input data sources include environment variables, user inputs, or external data; potential sinks are network calls, file operations, or system commands.",
  "sinks": "Untrusted data can lead to data leaks, command execution, or network communication with malicious domains.",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (inputs/env) to sinks (network/system calls), potentially via dynamic eval or obfuscated code.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation scores, dynamic eval usage, suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, or unusual control flow structures.",
  "analysis": "The code in the suspicious package exhibits obfuscation (high obfuscated score), dynamic code execution (eval/exec), and potential network or system calls. The high malware score (0.6) and obfuscation score (0.8) are justified by these patterns. Other reports show no signs of malicious activity, with scores reflecting low risk and no obfuscation. The confidence levels align with the evidence; the absence of code or clear malicious indicators results in low scores for benign reports. The scores are consistent with the described behaviors and suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "The package exhibits high obfuscation and suspicious dynamic execution, indicating likely malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.6 and obfuscated score of 0.8. Other reports are benign with scores of zero. Overall, the security risk is moderate to high for the suspicious package, and low for others. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis.",
