      "conclusion": "The code is suspicious primarily due to the obfuscated symbol name, which warrants further review. No direct evidence of malicious activity is present in this fragment. The scores assigned are appropriate and consistent with the analysis. Further investigation should focus on the 'sdk' module's contents and the usage context of the imported symbol to determine if malicious behavior exists."

      "conclusion": "The code does not show active malicious behavior but contains vectors that could be exploited for malicious code execution through untrusted serialized data and zip files. Proper validation and signature verification are recommended to mitigate these risks. The obfuscation level is moderate, raising suspicion but not confirming malicious intent."

      "confidence": 0.9,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign data generation utility that creates label combinations and random numeric data based on configuration inputs. No malicious activity, backdoors, or data exfiltration mechanisms are present. Variable obfuscation reduces readability but does not imply malicious intent. The lack of input validation is a minor concern but does not constitute a security vulnerability. The assigned scores are appropriate and consistent with the analysis, indicating a low security risk and no malware presence."

      "obfuscated": 0.7,
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function performing a straightforward calculation. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation indicating malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate due to variable naming but not malicious, and security risk is negligible. Minor adjustments could be made to obfuscation scores if desired, but overall, the code is safe."

      "conclusion": "The package exhibits high obfuscation and suspicious dynamic execution, indicating likely malicious intent, warranting a malware score of 0.6 and obfuscated score of 0.8. Other reports are benign with scores of zero. Overall, the security risk is moderate to high for the suspicious package, and low for others. The scores are justified and consistent with the analysis."

The directory cleanup functions should be used cautiously, but in the current context, they seem intended for cache management. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. No malware detected."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a sophisticated, obfuscated utility module for logging, dependency verification, and caching. There is no indication of malicious intent or malware. The high obfuscation scores are justified given the naming style, but they do not imply malicious behavior. Overall, the security risk is low, though obfuscation warrants cautious review of external dependencies."

The high obfuscation score is justified, but the malware risk remains negligible. The code appears benign, and the security risk is minimal, primarily due to obfuscation rather than malicious behavior."
