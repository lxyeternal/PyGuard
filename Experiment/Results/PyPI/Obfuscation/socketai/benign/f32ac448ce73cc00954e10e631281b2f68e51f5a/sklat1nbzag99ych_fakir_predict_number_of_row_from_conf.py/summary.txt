  "conclusion": "The code is a benign utility function performing a straightforward calculation. No malicious behavior, security risks, or obfuscation indicating malicious intent are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score is 0, obfuscation is moderate due to variable naming but not malicious, and security risk is negligible. Minor adjustments could be made to obfuscation scores if desired, but overall, the code is safe."
