  "conclusion": "The code functions as a multipart/form-data HTTP client with significant obfuscation and incomplete variables. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as data theft, backdoors, or system compromise. However, the obfuscation and incomplete variables raise suspicion and warrant cautious review before deployment or further analysis. The overall malware score is low, but the obfuscation and potential for misuse justify a moderate security concern."
