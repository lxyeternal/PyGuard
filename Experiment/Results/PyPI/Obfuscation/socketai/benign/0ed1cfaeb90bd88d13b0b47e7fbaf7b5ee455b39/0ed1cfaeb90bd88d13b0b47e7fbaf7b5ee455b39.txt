      "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated exception class with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but there is no evidence of malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at zero. The obfuscation warrants attention if part of a larger obfuscated codebase, but on its own, it is benign."

      "conclusion": "The code is a complex terminal and subprocess management utility with high obfuscation and system control capabilities. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or payloads, but its complexity and low-level interactions could be exploited if misused. Overall, it appears benign but warrants cautious monitoring in security-sensitive contexts."

      "conclusion": "The code functions as a multipart/form-data HTTP client with significant obfuscation and incomplete variables. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as data theft, backdoors, or system compromise. However, the obfuscation and incomplete variables raise suspicion and warrant cautious review before deployment or further analysis. The overall malware score is low, but the obfuscation and potential for misuse justify a moderate security concern."

      "confidence": 0.75,
      "conclusion": "The code does not contain malicious payloads or active malicious behavior. Its obfuscation and incomplete implementation are suspicious but not indicative of malware. The primary concern is potential misuse via external callback functions, which could execute arbitrary code if malicious functions are supplied. The overall security risk is low but not negligible, mainly due to obfuscation and incomplete code structure."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a complex, obfuscated asciicast processing module, likely for playback or analysis. While it does not show clear malicious intent, its obfuscation and terminal interactions warrant cautious review, especially if used in security-sensitive environments. The low malware score (0.2) and moderate risk (0.4) reflect this cautious stance."

      "conclusion": "The code exhibits high suspicion due to obfuscation, syntax errors, and incomplete functions. While no explicit malicious activity is evident from the snippet alone, these indicators warrant treating the code as potentially malicious or sabotaging. Further analysis of the actual processing function and dynamic behavior is essential."

      "confidence": 0.7,
      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a configuration utility with obfuscation techniques. No evidence of malware or malicious activity is detected. The obfuscation warrants caution but does not confirm malicious intent. Slightly increasing malware suspicion to about 0.4 is advisable given the obfuscation and suspicious import, but overall, the risk remains low."

The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score close to zero. Caution is warranted due to obfuscation, but the code appears benign."
