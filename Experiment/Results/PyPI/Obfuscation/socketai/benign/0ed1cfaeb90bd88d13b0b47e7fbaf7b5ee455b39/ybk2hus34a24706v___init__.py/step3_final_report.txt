{
  "purpose": "A wrapper function delegating parameters to an imported, obfuscated function, likely for logging or recording purposes.",
  "sources": "Input parameters to the wrapper function; the imported function 'eiLfHwWrBbkezwnAgnoTeRNgVUAJmQKa'.",
  "sinks": "The external function call 'eiLfHwWrBbkezwnAgnoTeRNgVUAJmQKa', which may process or transmit data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the wrapper parameters into the delegated function call.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names; reliance on an external, opaque function; no visible malicious code in the snippet.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a version check and a wrapper that forwards parameters to an external function with obfuscated identifiers. No network, file, or data exfiltration activities are visible. The obfuscation and delegation pattern raise suspicion but do not confirm malicious intent. The external function's implementation is unknown, preventing definitive conclusions. The scores assigned in the reports reflect low likelihood of malware but high obfuscation concern. The overall risk remains moderate due to opacity, but no active malicious behavior is evident from this snippet.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign wrapper around a logging or recording function, with obfuscation that warrants caution but no concrete evidence of malicious activity. Further investigation into the external module and function is recommended to clarify intent.",
