{
  "purpose": "Custom exception class definition, likely used for error handling in a larger codebase.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output points, especially untrusted data handling, present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the class is a simple exception definition.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name with a seemingly random string; no other code or logic present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with a nonsensical name, which might indicate obfuscation or generated code. There are no data inputs, processing, or external interactions. The class itself contains no logic, methods, or security-sensitive operations. The absence of additional code or context limits the ability to identify malicious intent, but nothing in this fragment indicates malicious behavior. The code appears to be a straightforward class definition, potentially part of a larger, benign codebase.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, non-malicious class definition with an unusual name but no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this isolated snippet.",
