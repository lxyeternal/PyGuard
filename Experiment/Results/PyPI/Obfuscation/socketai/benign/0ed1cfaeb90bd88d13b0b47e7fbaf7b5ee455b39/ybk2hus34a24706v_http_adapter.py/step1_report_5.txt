  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present",
  "flows": "No data flow or source-to-sink paths in this code",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name with random string; minimal context; no functionality beyond exception definition",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class with an obfuscated, nonsensical name. It inherits from the built-in Exception class and contains no additional methods or attributes. There are no inputs, data processing, or external interactions. The class appears purely as a placeholder or obfuscated identifier, with no malicious behavior or code execution. The unusual class name might be intended to obscure intent but does not by itself indicate malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code simply declares a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There are no signs of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks in this snippet. It appears harmless and does not perform any harmful actions.",
