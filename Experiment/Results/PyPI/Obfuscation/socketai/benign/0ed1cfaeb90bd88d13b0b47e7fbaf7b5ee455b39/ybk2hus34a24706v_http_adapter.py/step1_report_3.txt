  "sinks": "No data processing, input, or output present",
  "flows": "No data flow; only class declaration",
  "anomalies": "Unusually complex class name for an exception, which could be suspicious but not inherently malicious",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class inheriting from Exception with a deliberately obfuscated or nonsensical name. There are no data inputs, outputs, or external interactions. The class does not contain any methods or code that could execute malicious actions. The purpose appears to be to create a uniquely named exception class, possibly to evade detection or for obfuscation, but it does not include malicious behavior by itself.",
  "conclusion": "This code only defines a custom exception class with a complex name. It contains no malicious code, data leaks, or suspicious behavior. The obfuscated class name may suggest an intent to evade detection, but without additional code, it appears benign.",
