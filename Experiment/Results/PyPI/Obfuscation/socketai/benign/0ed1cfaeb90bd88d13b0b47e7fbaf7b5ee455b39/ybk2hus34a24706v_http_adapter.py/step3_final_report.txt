{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, likely used for error handling or as a placeholder.",
  "sources": "Class definition reading the class name and inheritance from Exception.",
  "sinks": "No data input/output, external interactions, or untrusted data processing present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; class inheritance does not involve data transfer or external sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated, complex class name with no additional logic or methods; minimal code structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward class inheriting from Exception with a highly obfuscated name. No data input, output, or external interactions are present. The class contains no methods or logic, indicating it functions solely as a custom exception placeholder. The obfuscated name could be used to hide intent but does not inherently imply malicious activity. The security risk and malware scores are low, reflecting the benign nature of the code. The obfuscation score is high due to the unusual class name, which is justified. Confidence in benign assessment is high, but the obfuscated name warrants cautious monitoring in broader contexts.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, obfuscated exception class with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The high obfuscation score is justified, but there is no evidence of malicious intent. Overall, the security risk is minimal, and the malware score remains at zero. The obfuscation warrants attention if part of a larger obfuscated codebase, but on its own, it is benign.",
