  "conclusion": "The code is a terminal session management utility, likely for recording or automation purposes. No evidence of malware or malicious backdoors is present. The obfuscation is notable but not indicative of malicious intent. The overall security risk is low, with a malware score close to zero. Caution is warranted due to obfuscation, but the code appears benign."
