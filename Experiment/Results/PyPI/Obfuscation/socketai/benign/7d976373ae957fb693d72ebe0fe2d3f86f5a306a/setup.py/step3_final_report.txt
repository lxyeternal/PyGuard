  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script using setuptools with obfuscated variable names.",
  "sources": "Static string assignments, including package name, version, author, URL, dependencies.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call with parameters; no untrusted data or external data sources.",
  "flows": "Variables assigned from static strings to setup() parameters; no data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, placeholder in URL ({PACKAGE_NAME}), dynamic string formatting.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script with obfuscated variable names likely for concealment. No network activity, malicious payloads, or data exfiltration are present. The placeholder in the URL suggests incomplete or templated code but is static here. Obfuscation alone does not indicate malicious intent, though it warrants caution. No signs of malware or security vulnerabilities are detected in this static analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, obfuscated package setup with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The placeholder URL is harmless in this static context. Overall, the code is safe but should be reviewed if integrated into larger systems or if dynamic replacement occurs.",
