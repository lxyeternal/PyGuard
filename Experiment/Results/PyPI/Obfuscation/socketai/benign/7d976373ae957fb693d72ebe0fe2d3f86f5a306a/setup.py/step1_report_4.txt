  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package, defining package metadata, dependencies, and source files.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded strings for package version, author, email, URL, and dependencies; variable assignments; string manipulations.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no untrusted data processing, network connections, or sensitive data handling.",
  "flows": "Initialization of package metadata from hardcoded strings with minimal transformations.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names, dynamic URL construction, and unusual variable assignments. The code appears intentionally convoluted, likely to conceal its purpose.",
  "analysis": "The script primarily configures package metadata for setuptools, with no evident malicious activity. Variable names are intentionally obscure, but their usage aligns with typical setup.py patterns. No network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious payloads are present. The code's complexity seems designed to obfuscate, but it does not perform harmful actions. The dependencies are standard and appear benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as a package setup script with obfuscated variable names but no malicious behavior. No indicators of malware or security risks are detected. The obfuscation seems intended for concealment rather than malicious intent.",
