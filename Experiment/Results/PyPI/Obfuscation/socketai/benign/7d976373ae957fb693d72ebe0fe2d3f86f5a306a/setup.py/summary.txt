  "conclusion": "The script is a benign, obfuscated package setup with no evidence of malicious behavior. The obfuscation may be for concealment but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The placeholder URL is harmless in this static context. Overall, the code is safe but should be reviewed if integrated into larger systems or if dynamic replacement occurs."
