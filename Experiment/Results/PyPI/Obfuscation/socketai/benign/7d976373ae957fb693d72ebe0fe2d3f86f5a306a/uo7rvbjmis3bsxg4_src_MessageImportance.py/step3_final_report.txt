{
  "purpose": "Defines an enum with three members, assigned specific values, with obfuscated class and member names.",
  "sources": "Class definition and enum members; no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or external data flows present.",
  "flows": "N/A - static enum definition with no data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class and member names; no malicious code or side effects.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward enum with obfuscated names, no external input, network activity, or malicious constructs. No signs of malicious behavior, data leaks, or security vulnerabilities are detected. The obfuscation appears to be for concealment but does not imply malicious intent. Malware score is zero; obfuscation score is high (~0.8); security risk is very low (~0.1). The code's simplicity and lack of malicious indicators support a benign assessment.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with obfuscated naming likely for concealment rather than malicious purpose. Scores are consistent with the analysis, indicating no malicious activity or significant security risk.",
