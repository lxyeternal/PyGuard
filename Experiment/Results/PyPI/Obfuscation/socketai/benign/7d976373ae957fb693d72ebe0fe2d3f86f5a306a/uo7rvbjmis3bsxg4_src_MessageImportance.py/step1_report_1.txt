{
  "purpose": "Define an enumeration with three members, each assigned specific integer values.",
  "sources": "The code reads the class definition and the Enum members; no external input is read.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points where untrusted data could cause security issues.",
  "flows": "No data flows from external sources to sinks; the code only defines an enum.",
  "anomalies": "The enum class and member names appear obfuscated, using non-descriptive, random strings. No hardcoded credentials or malicious constructs detected.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with three members, all assigned fixed integer values. The class and member names appear intentionally obfuscated, which is often a technique to hide intent. No external input, no dynamic execution, no suspicious network activity, and no apparent malicious logic. The code is straightforward and does not contain signs of malicious behavior or sabotage. The obfuscation might be for concealment, but on its own, it is not evidence of malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "This code defines an enum with obfuscated naming, but contains no malicious behavior, security risks, or malware indicators. It appears as benign obfuscation rather than malicious code.",
