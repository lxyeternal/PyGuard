{
  "purpose": "Defines an enumeration class with several named constants.",
  "sources": "The code reads no external input or data sources.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks where untrusted data could cause data leaks or system effects.",
  "flows": "No data flows from sources to sinks since the code only defines an enum.",
  "anomalies": "The enum class has non-descriptive, seemingly random, and obfuscated names and values, which could be suspicious but are not inherently malicious. No hardcoded secrets or malicious code are present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports the Enum class from the enum module and defines an enumeration with three members having numeric values. The naming appears obfuscated or auto-generated, which can sometimes be a sign of malicious obfuscation, but in this context, it seems purely for naming obscurity. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious side effects. The code is straightforward and minimal, with no apparent security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple enumeration definition with obfuscated naming. There is no malicious intent or security risk apparent. The use of obfuscated names alone does not indicate malicious behavior, especially since the code contains no malicious actions or data leaks.",
