  "purpose": "Define an enumeration with three named constants for internal use.",
  "sources": "No external input sources; all data is statically defined within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data outputs, external calls, or sensitive operations are present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; the code only sets static enum values.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual naming of enum class and members with obfuscated-like identifiers; no meaningful or descriptive names, which may be used to hide intent.",
  "analysis": "The code defines an Enum class with three members assigned integer values. The class and member names are non-descriptive, potentially obfuscated. There are no external data sources, no runtime data processing, and no suspicious operations. The code appears to serve as a simple internal constant holder, with no evident malicious behavior. The naming convention, however, could suggest obfuscation or an attempt to hide purpose, but on its own, this does not imply malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a straightforward enumeration definition with obfuscated naming. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks within this snippet. The obfuscated naming may be intentional for code obscurity but does not indicate harmful intent.",
