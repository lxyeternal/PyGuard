{
  "purpose": "Static configuration data defining component metadata, including IDs, messages, contact info, and headers.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded variables and dictionary assignments within the code.",
  "sinks": "No data flows or untrusted data sinks are present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow; static assignments do not involve data transmission or processing.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names and inclusion of potentially sensitive contact info; no active malicious code or network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of static variable assignments with obfuscated names, representing configuration data. No network activity, data exfiltration, or dynamic behavior is observed. The presence of obfuscation and hardcoded contact info warrants cautious review but does not constitute malicious intent. The malware score is appropriately zero, indicating no malicious behavior. The obfuscation score (~0.6-0.7) is justified given variable naming. The security risk score (~0.2) reflects low risk due to static configuration. The overall structure and content do not suggest active threats or vulnerabilities.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign static configuration with obfuscated variable names. While obfuscation warrants caution, there is no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scores assigned are consistent with the analysis, and no adjustments are necessary.",
