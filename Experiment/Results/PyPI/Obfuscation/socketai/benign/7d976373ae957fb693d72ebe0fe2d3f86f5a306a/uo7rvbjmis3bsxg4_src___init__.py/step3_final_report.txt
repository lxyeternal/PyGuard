{
  "purpose": "Assessment of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior or security risks based on provided code snippets or descriptions.",
  "sources": "Environment variables, imported modules (os, sys, socket, subprocess, requests), user inputs, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "subprocess calls, socket/network requests, system commands, environment variables, data outputs.",
  "flows": "Data flows from environment variables or user inputs to system/network operations via subprocess, socket, or requests modules.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded secrets, suspicious patterns, or obfuscation detected; no malicious payloads observed.",
  "analysis": "The code is either absent or described as standard utility modules. When code is provided, it involves typical modules used for network or system tasks, with potential sinks like subprocess and socket. No evidence of malicious activity, obfuscation, or anomalies is found. The scores reflect cautious but justified assessments, with malware scores at zero and low security risk scores, considering the potential misuse of modules if inputs are untrusted.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the available information, the dependency shows no signs of malicious behavior or obfuscation. The risk is low, and the code appears benign. Slightly elevated risk scores for certain modules are justified but do not indicate active threats.",
