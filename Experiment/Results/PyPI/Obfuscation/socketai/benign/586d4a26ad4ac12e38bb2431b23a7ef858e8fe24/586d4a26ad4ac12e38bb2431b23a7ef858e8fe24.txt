      "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign but employs obfuscation that warrants caution. No direct malicious activity is evident in this snippet. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but without evidence from the imported modules, the overall threat remains low. Further analysis of the imported modules is advised to rule out hidden malicious code."

      "conclusion": "The code is a benign image capture utility with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary security concern is filename validation, which is outside the scope of this code but should be considered in deployment. Malware likelihood is very low; obfuscation is moderate; overall security risk is low."

No major adjustments are necessary; the scoring accurately reflects the described behaviors."
