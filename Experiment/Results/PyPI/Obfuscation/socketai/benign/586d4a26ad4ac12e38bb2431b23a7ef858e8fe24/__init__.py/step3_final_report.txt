  "purpose": "Module initialization and export of specific functions and classes for a package, likely related to image processing or visualization.",
  "sources": "Internal module imports (_reader, _widget, _writer), version string assignment.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Import statements and the __all__ list define the module's interface; no data flow or untrusted data processing occurs here.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable and module names, which is unusual and suspicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a minimal package __init__-like file that imports internal modules with obfuscated names and defines an export list. There are no direct malicious actions, network calls, or data leaks visible. The obfuscation of variable and module names raises suspicion but does not confirm malicious intent. The scores from reports align with this: low malware likelihood (~0.1-0.2), high obfuscation (~0.75), and moderate security risk (~0.3). The primary concern is the obfuscation, which could conceal malicious code within the imported modules. Further inspection of '_reader', '_widget', and '_writer' modules is recommended to confirm their safety.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself appears benign but employs obfuscation that warrants caution. No direct malicious activity is evident in this snippet. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but without evidence from the imported modules, the overall threat remains low. Further analysis of the imported modules is advised to rule out hidden malicious code.",
