  "conclusion": "The code is a benign image capture utility with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary security concern is filename validation, which is outside the scope of this code but should be considered in deployment. Malware likelihood is very low; obfuscation is moderate; overall security risk is low."
