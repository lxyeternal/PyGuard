  "purpose": "Capture viewer images from napari and save them to disk.",
  "sources": "Viewer data accessed via napari.current_viewer() and function parameters providing filenames and data.",
  "sinks": "imageio.imwrite writes image data to specified filenames.",
  "flows": "Viewer data -> imageio.imwrite -> filename provided as parameter.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and function names; no validation of filename inputs; no network activity or data exfiltration.",
  "analysis": "The code interacts with napari to capture the current viewer's image and saves it to disk using imageio.imwrite. The variable and function names are intentionally obfuscated, which raises suspicion but does not indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of network activity, backdoors, or malicious payloads. The main potential security concern is the use of filename parameters without validation, which could lead to path traversal or overwriting issues if filenames are untrusted. Overall, the code appears to be a legitimate utility for image capture and saving, with obfuscation likely for code protection rather than malicious purposes.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign image capture utility with obfuscated naming but no evidence of malicious behavior. The primary security concern is filename validation, which is outside the scope of this code but should be considered in deployment. Malware likelihood is very low; obfuscation is moderate; overall security risk is low.",
