  "purpose": "Generate a 512x512 array of random numbers using numpy's random module.",
  "sources": "Import statement for numpy and call to numpy.random.rand() function.",
  "sinks": "No sinks where untrusted data affects system security or leaks data.",
  "flows": "Import numpy -> Call to numpy.random.rand() -> Return generated array.",
  "anomalies": "Function name is obfuscated and non-descriptive, possibly suspicious. No other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports __future__ annotations and numpy, then defines a function with an obfuscated name that returns a 512x512 array of random values generated by numpy's random module. There are no external inputs, no data sinks, and no signs of malicious behavior. The function's purpose appears to be to generate random data. The obfuscated name could be a minor concern, but the functionality is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, generating random data with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks.",
