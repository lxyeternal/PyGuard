  "flows": "Input (none) -> numpy.random.rand() -> return",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious behaviors observed. No use of environment variables or unsafe code patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code imports numpy and defines a function that returns a 512x512 array of random values generated by numpy's random number generator. The function name appears obfuscated or non-descriptive, which might be a sign of obfuscation, but not malicious intent. There are no input sources such as user input or external data, and no data sinks that could leak data. The use of numpy's random generator is standard and does not indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility function for generating random data. There is no evidence of malicious intent or security risks in this fragment.",
