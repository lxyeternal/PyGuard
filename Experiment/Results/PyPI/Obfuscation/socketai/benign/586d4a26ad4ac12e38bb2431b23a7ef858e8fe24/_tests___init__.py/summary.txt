  "conclusion": "The reports are internally consistent; benign code is scored appropriately with low malware and obfuscation scores, while suspicious code with obfuscation and dynamic execution is scored higher, reflecting moderate suspicion. No major adjustments are necessary; the scoring accurately reflects the described behaviors."
