  "purpose": "This code appears to be a Python script intended for data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, the exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Reads data from input parameters, possibly from environment variables or external input functions (e.g., input(), sys.argv).",
  "sinks": "Potentially writes data to files, prints to stdout, or sends data over network connections (e.g., requests.post, socket connections).",
  "flows": "Data flows from sources (user input, environment variables) to sinks (file writes, network transmission).",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or suspicious behavior detected. Code structure appears standard; no unnecessary dynamic execution or complex obfuscation patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code reads inputs from standard sources (like user input or environment variables), processes data through functions, and outputs or transmits data. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, network connections to suspicious domains, or backdoors. Usage of third-party libraries appears typical for data handling. No hardcoded secrets or suspicious constructs are present. The code structure and function flow are straightforward, with no complex or unusual features indicating obfuscation or malware. Without external context, the analysis indicates normal behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. The code performs typical data processing functions with no evidence of sabotage or malware. The overall security risk is low.",
