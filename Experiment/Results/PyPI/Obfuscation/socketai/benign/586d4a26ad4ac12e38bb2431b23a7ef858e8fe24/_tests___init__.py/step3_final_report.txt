  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input reading functions (e.g., input(), environment variables), data processing, network/file operations, dynamic code execution (eval(), exec()), obfuscated strings.",
  "sinks": "Potential data leaks, network communication, file modifications, execution of untrusted code, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Input sources to dynamic execution or network/file operations, possibly via obfuscated or misleading variables.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of eval()/exec(), obfuscation techniques, dynamic code generation, suspicious variable names, network or file operations without clear purpose.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits varying levels of suspicious features. Reports 1-3 show no code or benign code with no obfuscation or malicious indicators, scoring malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk=0.2 or lower, with high confidence. Reports 4 and 5 contain signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, with scores reflecting moderate suspicion (malware=0.4-0.5, obfuscated=0.6-0.7, risk=0.55-0.6). The scores are consistent with the described features, indicating suspicion but no confirmed malicious activity. The confidence levels appropriately match the evidence, and the scores align with the severity of features present.",
  "conclusion": "The reports are internally consistent; benign code is scored appropriately with low malware and obfuscation scores, while suspicious code with obfuscation and dynamic execution is scored higher, reflecting moderate suspicion. No major adjustments are necessary; the scoring accurately reflects the described behaviors.",
