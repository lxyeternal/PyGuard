{
  "purpose": "The code performs percentile-based normalization on multi-channel data and creates animations of viewer states for visualization purposes.",
  "sources": "The code reads input data from 'arr' and accesses the global 'viewer' object via 'globals()'.",
  "sinks": "No direct data leaks or network activity; data flows within visualization functions and percentile calculations.",
  "flows": "Data is processed from 'arr' through percentile limits, then used to generate arrays for visualization; viewer state is manipulated via 'globals()' and 'napari' functions.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, dynamic access to 'viewer' via 'globals()', and a print statement referencing an undefined variable 'i' instead of the loop variable.",
  "analysis": "The code performs standard scientific visualization tasks with obfuscation and dynamic environment access. No evidence of malicious activity such as network communication, data exfiltration, or destructive operations. The obfuscation and use of 'globals()' could be exploited in malicious contexts, but the code itself appears benign. The bug in the print statement is likely a typo or obfuscation tactic, not malicious. Overall, the code's behavior is consistent with benign visualization workflows, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily for scientific visualization with obfuscation and dynamic global access, which could be exploited but shows no signs of malicious intent. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible.",
