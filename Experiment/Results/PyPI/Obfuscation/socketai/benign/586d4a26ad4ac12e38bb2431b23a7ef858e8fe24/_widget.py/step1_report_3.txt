  "flows": "Button click -> toggle scale bar unit -> modify scale bar attribute -> adjust layer scales -> reset view",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; print statement used for debugging, which is benign but indicates logging; no external network activity or suspicious imports.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a QWidget subclass with a button to toggle scale bar units between 'um' and ''. When toggled, it updates the scale attribute of each layer and resets the viewer view. The variable names are obfuscated but functionally consistent. There are no signs of malicious code such as data exfiltration, code injection, or network activity. The use of print is benign. No external inputs are processed that could lead to injection or leaks. The code relies entirely on the provided napari viewer object and modifies its properties.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to serve a legitimate UI purpose within napari to toggle scale bar units. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks are detected. The obfuscation seems to be solely for variable naming complexity rather than malicious intent.",
