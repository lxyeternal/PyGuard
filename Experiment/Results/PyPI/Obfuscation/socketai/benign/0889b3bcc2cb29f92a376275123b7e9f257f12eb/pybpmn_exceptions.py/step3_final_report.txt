{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name, likely for placeholder or concealment purposes.",
  "sources": "No data sources, inputs, or external data interactions present.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or untrusted data flows; code does not process or output data.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; class is a simple exception subclass with no logic.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears randomly generated or obfuscated; no logic or external interactions.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward custom exception class with an obfuscated name, containing no logic, data flow, or external interactions. The obfuscated name may be for concealment but does not indicate malicious intent. All reports correctly identify the absence of malicious behavior, with high obfuscation scores reflecting the class name's randomness. Malware scores are zero, and security risk scores are minimal, consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a simple, obfuscated custom exception class with no malicious or security concerns. The current scores are appropriate, with high obfuscation and very low security risk, and no further action is necessary.",
