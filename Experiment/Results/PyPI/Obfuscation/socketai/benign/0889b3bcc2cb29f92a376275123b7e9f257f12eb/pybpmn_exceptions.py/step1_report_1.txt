  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named SWeztwKrbNpMAPZRhjdktjPvBwyrBPCR",
  "sources": "No external data sources or input reading; class definition is static",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or output operations present",
  "flows": "No data flows; class is a simple exception subclass",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears randomly generated and does not indicate any functional purpose; no other anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception with an obfuscated or randomly generated name. There are no data sources, sinks, or flows, and the code does not perform any operations or contain logic that could be malicious. The class is simply a placeholder for exception handling.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition with no signs of malicious behavior or security issues. The class name's randomness might suggest obfuscation, but it does not by itself imply malicious intent.",
