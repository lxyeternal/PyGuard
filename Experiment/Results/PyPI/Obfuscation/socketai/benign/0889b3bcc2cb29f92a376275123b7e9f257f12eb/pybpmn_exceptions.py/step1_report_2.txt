  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named SWeztwKrbNpMAPZRhjdktjPvBwyrBPCR.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading occurs in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow exists; the code only declares a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears to be a random string, which is unusual and could indicate obfuscation or concealment. There are no other suspicious code patterns or behaviors.",
  "analysis": "The code defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated or randomly generated name. It does not contain any executable logic, input/output operations, or external interactions. The class name's randomness could be an attempt to hide malicious intent or simply obfuscation, but without additional context, it remains inconclusive. There are no signs of malicious activity, data leaks, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class definition for a custom exception with an obfuscated name. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks evident from this snippet alone.",
