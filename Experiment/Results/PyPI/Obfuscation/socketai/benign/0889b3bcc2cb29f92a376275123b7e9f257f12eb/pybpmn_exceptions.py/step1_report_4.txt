  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class named SWeztwKrbNpMAPZRhjdktjPvBwyrBPCR.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data sources are present in the code.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data handling or external output points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow paths, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "The class name appears obfuscated or randomly generated, which is unusual but not inherently malicious. No other anomalies are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a single class definition for a custom exception, inheriting from Exception, with a non-descriptive, seemingly random class name. There are no data inputs, outputs, or any logic that could indicate malicious intent. The structure is straightforward and standard for defining custom exceptions. The random class name might suggest obfuscation or lack of meaningful intent, but it does not inherently indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a simple, harmless class definition for a custom exception with an obfuscated name. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this snippet.",
