  "purpose": "Definition of a custom exception class named SWeztwKrbNpMAPZRhjdktjPvBwyrBPCR",
  "sources": "No external input or data reading observed",
  "sinks": "No data outputs or external communication observed",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flow, as the code only defines a class",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name with a nonsensical, random string; no functional code or comments provided",
  "analysis": "The code defines a single custom exception class inheriting from Exception with a nonsensical, obfuscated name. There are no data inputs, no processing, no external interactions, or behaviors that could be malicious. The class is empty, serving solely as a placeholder for exception handling. No malicious or suspicious activity is evident.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple, obfuscated exception class definition with no malicious intent or security issues. The unusual class name appears to be randomly generated or intentionally obfuscated but does not pose any threat or security risk.",
