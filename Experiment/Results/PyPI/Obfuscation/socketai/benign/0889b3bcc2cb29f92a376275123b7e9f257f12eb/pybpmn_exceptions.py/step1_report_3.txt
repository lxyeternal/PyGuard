  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class named SWeztwKrbNpMAPZRhjdktjPvBwyrBPCR.",
  "sources": "No input or data reading sources in the code.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs; the code only declares a class.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks, as the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual class name that appears to be a random string; no documentation or comments; no other code present.",
  "analysis": "The code contains a single class definition inheriting from Exception, likely intended for use as a custom exception. The class name appears to be randomly generated or obfuscated, which is uncommon for standard coding practices and may indicate an attempt to conceal purpose or obfuscate intent. No other logic, input handling, or external interactions are present. There are no signs of malicious behavior, but the obscure naming could be suspicious in a security review context.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple custom exception class with an unusually obfuscated name. There is no malicious behavior or security risk inherent in this snippet alone. The primary concern is the use of an opaque class name, which may be part of obfuscation but does not indicate malicious intent by itself.",
