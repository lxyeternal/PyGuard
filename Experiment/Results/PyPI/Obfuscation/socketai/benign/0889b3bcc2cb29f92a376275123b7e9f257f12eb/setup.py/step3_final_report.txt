{
  "purpose": "Standard package setup script with obfuscated variables and parameters, possibly hiding secrets or proprietary info.",
  "sources": "Reading 'README.md' file; obfuscated setup argument keys and values, notably 'e8cysk92ebuvxeqb' assigned to a non-standard key.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no network activity, data exfiltration, or code execution observed in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Reading 'README.md' into a variable; passing obfuscated parameters to setup(); no further data flow evident.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; non-standard setup argument keys; presence of a hardcoded string 'e8cysk92ebuvxeqb' that may be a secret or token.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup script with high obfuscation, which raises suspicion but lacks evidence of malicious activity. The non-standard parameter keys and hardcoded string suggest potential hiding of secrets or proprietary info. No network or malicious code is present. The obfuscation and suspicious parameters justify a moderate security concern but do not confirm malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a standard setup script with obfuscation and potential secret exposure. While no malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation and hardcoded string warrant further review. The malware score remains at 0; the obfuscated score is high (~0.7); the security risk is moderate (~0.4).",
