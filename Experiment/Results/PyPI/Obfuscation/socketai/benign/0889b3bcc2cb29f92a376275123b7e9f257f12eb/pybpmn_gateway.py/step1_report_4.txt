{
  "purpose": "Define an abstract class that inherits from a base class imported from a local module, with an abstract method that takes two parameters.",
  "sources": "Import statement from a local module, and class/method definitions that may receive external input via method parameters.",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks or data flows that process untrusted data or perform output operations.",
  "flows": "Method parameters potentially receive external data, but the method is abstract and contains no implementation to analyze further.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated-looking class and method names, but no actual malicious behavior or suspicious code present. No hardcoded credentials or malicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports an internal class from a relative module and defines an abstract subclass with an abstract method. There is no implementation or executable code within the method, so no runtime behavior, data flows, or security issues can be assessed. The obfuscated naming does not imply malicious intent but may indicate attempts at concealment. Overall, the code appears to be a stub or interface definition, with no signs of malicious activity or security risks.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward abstract class definition with obfuscated names, lacking any executable or malicious content. No malicious behavior or security risks are evident from this snippet.",
