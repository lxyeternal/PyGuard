  "purpose": "Manage task lifecycle events, invoking handler callbacks and updating task context with timestamps and status.",
  "sources": "Parameters such as gvVRwfsAqxdVUZbYwDHVQZUeSjEJjNTO, class attributes like self.task_context, self.process_instance, and self.FNmkgqmGGmNybXkLjDdxxsnVhpxSRBIP.",
  "sinks": "Handler method calls (on_enter_task, on_enter_{name}, on_exit_{name}, on_exit_task), context dictionary updates, and process instance method invocation.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input parameters and class attributes into handler method calls and context updates, often via dynamic attribute/method access.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable and method names, dynamic method invocation based on undefined 'name', exception handling that suppresses errors without logging, and limited input validation.",
  "analysis": "The code manages task state transitions with obfuscated identifiers, using dynamic invocation which could conceal malicious activity. The try-except blocks suppress errors, potentially hiding issues. No network activity, data exfiltration, or system modifications are evident. The obfuscation and dynamic invocation patterns are suspicious but not conclusively malicious. The exception handling could be improved with logging. Overall, the code appears to be a workflow component with obfuscation rather than malicious payload.",
  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic invocation patterns that warrant caution but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score (0.2) and high obfuscation score (0.8) are appropriate. The security risk is moderate (0.3), mainly due to obfuscation and dynamic behavior that could be exploited if handlers are malicious. Further runtime analysis is recommended to confirm safety.",
