  "conclusion": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic invocation patterns that warrant caution but lacks concrete evidence of malicious activity. The low malware score (0.2) and high obfuscation score (0.8) are appropriate. The security risk is moderate (0.3), mainly due to obfuscation and dynamic behavior that could be exploited if handlers are malicious. Further runtime analysis is recommended to confirm safety."
