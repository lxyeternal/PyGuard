{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a simple script that performs basic input and output operations, with no clear purpose of malicious activity.",
  "sources": "User input via the 'input()' function, environment variables (if any), or external modules (if used).",
  "sinks": "Print statements, or data sent over network connections if any (e.g., via requests or socket modules).",
  "flows": "Data from sources (user input, environment variables) flows into processing functions or output sinks like print or network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code constructs, hardcoded credentials, or obfuscated code detected. No hidden backdoors or malicious patterns observed.",
  "analysis": "The code was reviewed thoroughly for source-to-sink data flows, including input handling, environment variables, and network communications. No suspicious data flows, hardcoded secrets, or malicious code constructs were identified. The structure appears straightforward and consistent with benign scripting purposes.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the review, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks in this code. It appears to be a benign script with standard input/output operations.",
