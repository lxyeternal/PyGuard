{
  "purpose": "Setup script for a Python package that provides utility modules for working with Spark, containers, AWS, and more.",
  "sources": "The code reads static data from variables defining dependencies, package metadata, and setup parameters. No external input or data is read at runtime.",
  "sinks": "The setup() function call executes package installation and configuration. No untrusted data is processed or used in a way that could lead to data leaks or code execution.",
  "flows": "No untrusted data flows from sources to sinks; all data appears hardcoded and static within the script.",
  "anomalies": "The variable names are obfuscated or randomly generated, but this alone does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious network activity, or hidden behaviors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script performs a standard setup for a Python package, defining dependencies, package info, and calling setuptools.setup(). No external input or dynamic code execution occurs. Variable names are obfuscated but do not affect security. No malicious code, backdoors, or suspicious behavior identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a typical setup script for a Python package, with obfuscated variable names but no malicious or suspicious behavior. No indicators of malware or security risks detected.",
