  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious activity but should be noted as a superficial attempt to hide variable names. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is low."
