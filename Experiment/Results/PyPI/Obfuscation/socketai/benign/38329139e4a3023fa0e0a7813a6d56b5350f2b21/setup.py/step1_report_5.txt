  "purpose": "Set up configuration for a Python package, specifying dependencies and package metadata.",
  "sources": "The code reads static package metadata, dependencies, and package data defined within the script.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; the script does not perform actions involving untrusted data or sensitive operations.",
  "flows": "The setup function uses static variables to configure package installation; no dynamic data flow or external data sources involved.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual variable names composed of random strings; no apparent malicious behavior. No hardcoded secrets or obfuscated code detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script used for packaging Python modules. All variable names are obfuscated or nonsensical but are used only as container variables. The dependencies are standard and specify version constraints. There are no suspicious network calls, data exfiltration, or malicious logic. The code is straightforward and does not contain any hidden or malicious components.",
  "conclusion": "The script appears to be a benign setup configuration with obfuscated variable names. There are no signs of malicious behavior, malware, or security risks.",
