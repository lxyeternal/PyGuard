  "purpose": "Standard Python package setup script defining metadata, dependencies, and package data for distribution.",
  "sources": "Static data in variables defining dependencies, package info, and data; no external input or dynamic code.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data handling or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "N/A; static configuration without data flow from sources to sinks.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names with nonsensical identifiers; no malicious code, network activity, or data exfiltration detected.",
  "analysis": "The code is a typical setup.py script importing 'setup' from setuptools, defining package metadata, dependencies, and package data in variables with obfuscated names, then calling setup() with these variables. No dynamic code, user input, network activity, or code injection is present. The obfuscation appears superficial, likely intended to hide variable names but not malicious. Dependencies are common and version-constrained, with no suspicious patterns. The overall structure and content are benign, and no indicators of malicious behavior or security risks are evident.",
  "conclusion": "This is a benign setup script with superficial obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious intent, code injection, or security vulnerabilities. The obfuscation does not indicate malicious activity but should be noted as a superficial attempt to hide variable names. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, obfuscation is moderate, and overall security risk is low.",
