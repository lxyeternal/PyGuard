{
  "purpose": "The code defines two functions to create and configure SparkSession objects for data processing, specifically targeting environments using AWS S3 and Glue Data Catalog.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'AWS_DEFAULT_REGION' and 'GLUE_CATALOG_ID' accessed via os.environ.get in the second function.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the SparkSession objects could be used to interact with external storage or services; no explicit data sink or malicious data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during SparkSession configuration; these variables could influence connection parameters but are not directly used in data processing or network communications within this code.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code. The code uses environment variables securely; no suspicious or unusual code patterns are present.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs Spark sessions with specific configurations, mainly for AWS S3 and Delta Lake integration, and one function enables Hive support with AWS Glue. All credentials are managed via standard AWS credential providers or environment variables. No dynamic code execution, obfuscated code, or malicious behavior is detected. The functions appear to be legitimate configuration routines for Spark-based data processing pipelines.",
  "conclusion": "The code is standard Spark configuration code intended for AWS data processing environments. It does not contain malicious behavior, backdoors, or security risks. It reads environment variables securely and does not perform any harmful actions.",
