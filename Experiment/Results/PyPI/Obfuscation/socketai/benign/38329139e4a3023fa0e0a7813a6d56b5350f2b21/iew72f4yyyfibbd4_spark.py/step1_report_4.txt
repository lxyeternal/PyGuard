{
  "purpose": "The code initializes and configures SparkSession objects for data processing with specific configurations for AWS S3 and Delta Lake integration.",
  "sources": "os.environ.get('AWS_DEFAULT_REGION'), os.environ.get('GLUE_CATALOG_ID') - reading environment variables for AWS region and Glue catalog ID.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data outputs identified; no external data is written or transmitted in this code.",
  "flows": "Environment variables provide configuration parameters; these are used in SparkSession configurations but do not directly influence data flow from untrusted sources.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for AWS region and Glue catalog ID is typical; no suspicious hard-coded credentials or secrets. No obfuscated or unusual code structures are present.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions to create SparkSession objects with different configurations. Both functions set various Spark parameters related to memory, dynamic allocation, and AWS S3 access. The second function reads environment variables for AWS region and Glue catalog ID, which are used to configure AWS Glue and Hive support. There is no indication of data leakage, malicious network activity, or sabotage. The code appears to be standard configuration code for Spark with AWS integrations, with proper use of environment variables and no suspicious or malicious constructs.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward setup for Spark sessions with AWS S3 and Delta Lake support. No malicious behavior, backdoors, or security issues are evident. Use of environment variables is normal, and no suspicious data handling is present.",
