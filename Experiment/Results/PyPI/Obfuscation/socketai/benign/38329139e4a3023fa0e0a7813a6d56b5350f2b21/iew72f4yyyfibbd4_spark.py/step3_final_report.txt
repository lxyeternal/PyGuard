  "purpose": "Configure Spark sessions for AWS S3, Delta Lake, and Glue integration with environment variables for credentials and catalog IDs.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'AWS_DEFAULT_REGION' and 'GLUE_CATALOG_ID'; function parameters; imported modules.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks or data exfiltration points; no network activity or data leaks evident.",
  "flows": "Configuration parameters sourced from environment variables and function arguments; no data processing or external communication.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated function and variable names; use of environment variables is standard; no hardcoded secrets; no malicious code or dynamic execution.",
  "analysis": "The code sets up Spark sessions with AWS and Delta Lake configurations, using environment variables for credentials and catalog IDs. No malicious payloads, network activity, or data exfiltration are present. Obfuscation of names is suspicious but not malicious. The scores across reports consistently indicate no malware, low security risk, and moderate obfuscation. The code appears to be standard cloud configuration code, with obfuscation possibly intended to hinder readability but not malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate Spark configuration setup for AWS environments. No signs of malicious activity or sabotage are detected. Obfuscation is noted but not indicative of malicious behavior. Overall, the security risk is low, and the code is safe for use.",
