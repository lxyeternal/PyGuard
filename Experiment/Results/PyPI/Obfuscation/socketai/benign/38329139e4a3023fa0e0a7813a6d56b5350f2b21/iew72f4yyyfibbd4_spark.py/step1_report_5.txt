{
  "purpose": "Provides functions to create Spark sessions with specific configurations for local and AWS Glue environments.",
  "sources": "Environment variables 'AWS_DEFAULT_REGION' and 'GLUE_CATALOG_ID' via os.environ.get.",
  "sinks": "None directly; configuration parameters are set based on environment variables and fixed strings.",
  "flows": "Environment variables are read during Spark session configuration; no untrusted input flows into data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Use of environment variables for AWS region and catalog ID; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; configurations appear standard for Spark and AWS integration.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions to initialize Spark sessions with particular configurations. The first function sets AWS credentials provider and Spark parameters; the second adds Hive support with AWS Glue-specific settings, utilizing environment variables for region and catalog ID. No suspicious or malicious code behaviors are detected; the use of environment variables for AWS configuration is standard practice. The code does not include any data input/output operations, network communication beyond AWS configuration, or hidden behavior. It appears to be a legitimate setup for Spark with AWS Glue integration.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard Spark session configuration script intended for AWS environment integration. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks based on the provided code. The only noteworthy aspect is reliance on environment variables for AWS settings, which is typical and not inherently malicious.",
