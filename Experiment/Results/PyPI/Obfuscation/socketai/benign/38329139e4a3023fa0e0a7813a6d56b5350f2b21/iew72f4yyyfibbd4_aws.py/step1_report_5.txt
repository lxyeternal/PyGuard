  "purpose": "The code retrieves secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and parameter values from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.",
  "sources": "Input parameters: 'secret_name', 'TDEmNMozOqTRrWGFuutLOVwANroUzqmd', and 'name' (region optional).",
  "sinks": "Calls to AWS SDK methods that fetch secrets and parameters; potential data leaks if secrets are mishandled or exposed.",
  "flows": "Input parameters are used directly in AWS SDK calls to fetch sensitive data, which are then returned as JSON or strings.",
  "anomalies": "The code uses obfuscated variable names, which is unusual and may hinder code review; no hardcoded secrets or credentials are visible; no suspicious network activity or backdoors are present.",
  "analysis": "The script defines two functions: one retrieves secrets from AWS Secrets Manager using a secret name and optional region, and the other retrieves a parameter value from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. The obfuscation of variable names is unusual but not inherently malicious. The functions perform standard AWS SDK calls with proper exception handling. No signs of malicious code, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious payloads, are evident. The code appears to be legitimate for managing secrets and configuration data in cloud environments. The use of obfuscated variable names might be for code concealment but does not imply malicious intent by itself.",
  "conclusion": "The code functions as an AWS secrets and parameter retrieval utility. There are no indications of malicious behavior, malicious data handling, or security risks. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious in context. Overall, this appears to be legitimate, standard code for secret management with no malware or security threats detected.",
