  "purpose": "The code retrieves secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and parameter values from AWS SSM Parameter Store.",
  "sources": "User provides 'secret_name' for Secrets Manager and 'name' (and optionally 'region') for SSM Parameter Store.",
  "sinks": "AWS SDK methods that access Secrets Manager and SSM Parameter Store, returning sensitive data.",
  "flows": "Input parameters ('secret_name', 'name', 'region') flow into AWS SDK calls which retrieve and return secrets/parameters.",
  "anomalies": "Function names and variable names are obfuscated (e.g., jBbsfLqiMpKYnLycyaVJaCwESZZvKyeg), which is suspicious but not necessarily malicious. No hardcoded credentials or unusual code behavior detected. The code performs standard AWS secret and parameter retrieval.",
  "analysis": "The code defines two functions: one retrieves a secret from AWS Secrets Manager; the other retrieves a parameter from AWS SSM. Both functions use obfuscated variable and function names, which can be a sign of code obfuscation but are not inherently malicious. The functions make standard AWS SDK calls, handle exceptions, and decode secret binaries if needed. No network communication beyond AWS SDK calls is performed. No hidden or backdoor behavior observed. No hardcoded credentials or suspicious logic. The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but based on the provided code, it appears to be a security-through-obscurity tactic rather than malicious activity.",
  "conclusion": "The code performs standard AWS secret and parameter retrieval with obfuscated identifiers. No evidence of malicious behavior, malware, or supply chain attacks detected. The obfuscation raises suspicion but is not definitive. Overall, the code appears benign and aligned with legitimate secret management practices.",
