{
  "purpose": "The code provides functions to retrieve secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and parameters from AWS SSM Parameter Store, facilitating secret and configuration management.",
  "sources": "The functions read input data from function parameters such as secret names, region names, and parameter names, and interact with AWS SDK methods to fetch secrets and parameters.",
  "sinks": "The code processes retrieved secrets and parameters, decoding binary secrets, and returns parsed JSON objects or parameter values; no external sinks or data exfiltration points are evident.",
  "flows": "Input parameters (secret names, region, parameter names) flow into AWS SDK calls via obfuscated method calls, with secrets decoded and returned as JSON objects or strings.",
  "anomalies": "Use of heavily obfuscated variable and function names, dynamic attribute access on boto3 client objects, and non-standard method calls suggest obfuscation aimed at hiding intent. No hardcoded secrets or malicious payloads are present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs legitimate AWS secret and parameter retrieval with exception handling and decoding. Obfuscation raises suspicion but does not directly indicate malicious activity. No evidence of malicious payloads, network exfiltration, or backdoors. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware likelihood remains low. The dynamic method access could be exploited if inputs are malicious, but in isolation, it appears as a standard secret management utility with obfuscation.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate secret management utility with significant obfuscation. While no malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation warrants further static or dynamic analysis to rule out malicious intent. The malware score should remain low (~0.1-0.2), the obfuscation score high (~0.8), and the overall security risk moderate (~0.3), primarily due to obfuscation concerns.",
