  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a legitimate secret management utility with significant obfuscation. While no malicious activity is evident, the obfuscation warrants further static or dynamic analysis to rule out malicious intent. The malware score should remain low (~0.1-0.2), the obfuscation score high (~0.8), and the overall security risk moderate (~0.3), primarily due to obfuscation concerns."
