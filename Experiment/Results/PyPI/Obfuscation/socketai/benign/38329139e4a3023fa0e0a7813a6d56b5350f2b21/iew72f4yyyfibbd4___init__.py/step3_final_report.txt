{
  "purpose": "This code imports specific functions/classes from the 'abi_ds_utils' package modules, assigns some to new variables with obfuscated names, and defines an __all__ list for exports, likely serving as a utility or setup module.",
  "sources": "Import statements from 'abi_ds_utils' modules, reading external module functions/classes.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or external communication points are present in this snippet.",
  "flows": "Imports are assigned to variables; no data flow or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names that do not clearly indicate their purpose; no active logic or data processing.",
  "analysis": "The code is a straightforward import and export setup with obfuscated identifiers. No functions are invoked, no data is processed, and no external communication occurs. The obfuscation may be for internal concealment but does not inherently imply malicious intent. The absence of data flows, network activity, or security-sensitive operations suggests a benign utility module. The high obfuscation score reflects the variable naming pattern, but malware and security risk scores remain low due to lack of evidence of malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign utility or setup module with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious activity, data exfiltration, or vulnerabilities within this fragment. Obfuscation alone does not imply malicious intent, though further review of the full module is recommended to confirm safety.",
