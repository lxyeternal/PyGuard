  "purpose": "Shebang line indicating the script's interpreter, intended as an entry point for a CLI application.",
  "sources": "The shebang line itself; no other data sources present.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling observed.",
  "flows": "No data flow; only a shebang and comments.",
  "anomalies": "Unusual, obfuscated interpreter path in shebang: '/usr/bin/piDaSfIpeEwqqMzdhaKOtRVCiKcaFxOo'.",
  "analysis": "The code contains only a shebang line with an obfuscated path and a comment. No executable code, data processing, or network activity is present. The shebang's unusual path suggests obfuscation or potential malicious intent, but without further code, malicious activity cannot be confirmed. The high obfuscation score is justified, while malware and risk scores should be low due to lack of actual malicious code. The suspicion is solely based on the shebang line, which could be used to hide malicious interpreters or payloads. Further investigation of the interpreter and the complete codebase is recommended.",
  "conclusion": "The snippet is minimal, with a suspicious shebang line but no evidence of malicious code. The high obfuscation score reflects suspicion, but overall security risk remains low in the absence of further code. Caution is advised if this shebang points to a custom or malicious interpreter.",
