{
  "purpose": "The code lists all error names and their exit codes.",
  "sources": "The code reads error names and their associated exit codes, likely from a predefined list or dictionary.",
  "sinks": "No direct sinks of untrusted data or potential data leaks are evident; the code primarily defines data structures.",
  "flows": "There are no source-to-sink flows; the code simply enumerates error names and codes.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or hardcoded secrets are observed. The code is straightforward and typical for error handling definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to define a list or dictionary of error names mapped to their respective exit codes. It does not include any input handling, network operations, or execution of external commands. No dynamic code execution, obfuscation, or malicious constructs are present. The code's purpose seems to be to standardize error reporting within a larger application. Based on this, there is no indication of malicious behavior, supply chain risks, or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard error code listing with no malicious intent or security risks identified. It is a benign component likely used for error handling in a larger program.",
