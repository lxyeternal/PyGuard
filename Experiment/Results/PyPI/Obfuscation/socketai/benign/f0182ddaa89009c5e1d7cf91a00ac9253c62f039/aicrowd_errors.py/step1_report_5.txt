  "purpose": "The code aims to list all error names and their corresponding exit codes.",
  "sources": "No explicit input sources or data reading operations are present.",
  "sinks": "No data leaks or sensitive operations are detected; no untrusted data processing occurs.",
  "flows": "Not applicable, as there are no data flows from input to output or sinks.",
  "anomalies": "The description suggests a simple enumeration or listing operation, but without actual code, no anomalies are identifiable.",
  "analysis": "The provided statement indicates a functionality to list error names and exit codes. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The task appears straightforward and benign, likely just mapping error names to their codes or printing them. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable misuse, or insecure operations are evident. Since no actual code is provided, the review is based solely on the description, which does not raise security concerns.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the description, the code appears to perform a harmless task of listing error names and exit codes without any malicious intent or security issues. No suspicious behavior or malware signs are detected.",
