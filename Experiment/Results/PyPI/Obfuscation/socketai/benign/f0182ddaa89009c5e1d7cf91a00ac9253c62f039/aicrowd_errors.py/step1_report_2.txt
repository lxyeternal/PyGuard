{
  "purpose": "The code lists all error names and their exit codes.",
  "sources": "Potential source could be error or exception handling constructs, such as dictionaries or lists containing error names and codes.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks include system exit calls or error reporting functions that could be triggered with untrusted data.",
  "flows": "Data flows from the error name and code definitions to any error handling or exit procedures.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated constructs detected. The description suggests straightforward listing of error names and codes.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to define a list or dictionary of error names mapped to exit codes, likely for use in a program's error handling. There are no indications of input reading, external data sources, or unsafe data flows. Without additional context, the code is a simple static listing with no malicious constructs or malicious intent apparent. No suspicious behavior, such as network activity, file modifications, or hidden code, is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign enumeration of error names and exit codes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
