  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Report 1:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Confirms that the code lists error names and exit codes, with no input handling, network activity, or malicious constructs.  \n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1  \n- **Assessment:** The report is thorough and consistent. No issues detected.\n\n**Report 2:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizes static listing, no external data, no malicious behavior.  \n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.9  \n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable. No red flags.\n\n**Report 3:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Reiterates straightforward listing, no suspicious patterns, no obfuscation.  \n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=0.8  \n- **Assessment:** Appropriate and consistent.\n\n**Report 4:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Same as above, no signs of malicious activity.  \n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0, confidence=1.0  \n- **Assessment:** Valid.\n\n**Report 5:**  \n- **Purpose & Analysis:** Describes a simple listing task, no code, no malicious activity, only a minimal security concern (securityRisk=0.1) which might be slightly overcautious given the description.  \n- **Score:** malware=0, securityRisk=0.1, confidence=0.8  \n- **Assessment:** Slightly elevated securityRisk score, but given the benign description, this seems acceptable.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of findings:\n- **Code presence:** All reports describe a benign static listing of error names and codes, with no evidence of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or data leaks.\n- **Malware score:** All are zero, which aligns with the description.\n- **Obfuscated:** All zero, consistent with straightforward code.\n- **Security risk:** All zero or very low, appropriate given the context.\n\n### Final recommendations:\n- The scores assigned are reasonable and consistent with the descriptions.\n- No changes needed unless actual code reveals hidden behavior, which is not indicated here.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation evident)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risks identified)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe reports are accurate and the scores are justified. The code appears to be a benign, straightforward listing of error names and exit codes with no security concerns.",
