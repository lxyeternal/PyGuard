  "purpose": "Lists all error names and their exit codes",
  "sources": "Potentially command-line inputs or error definitions within the script",
  "sinks": "Potentially output or error handling routines",
  "flows": "Input processing leading to error handling or output generation",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies; the description suggests a simple listing task",
  "analysis": "The code's purpose appears to be listing error names and exit codes. Without seeing actual implementation, it seems straightforward and likely just defines or outputs error codes. No signs of malicious logic such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors are evident. No suspicious code patterns, obfuscated code, or hardcoded secrets are present. The description alone indicates a benign utility, assuming the implementation matches the purpose. Due to lack of detailed code, no anomalies are identified.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a benign listing of error names and exit codes with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to serve a simple diagnostic or informational function.",
