  "purpose": "Lists all error names and their exit codes",
  "sources": "Static data structures (error name and code definitions)",
  "sinks": "None; static listing with no external input or data flow",
  "flows": "N/A; no data flow or untrusted data handling",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies; straightforward static listing, no obfuscation or suspicious patterns",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple, static listing of error names and exit codes, with no input handling, network activity, or dynamic behavior. All reports correctly identify the benign nature, assigning malware scores of 0 and low security risks. The descriptions suggest no malicious intent or obfuscation. The slight security risk score of 0.1 in one report appears overly cautious given the context, and should be adjusted to 0. The confidence levels are high, reflecting the straightforward analysis.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, with no malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities. The scores are appropriate, except for a minor overestimation of security risk in one report, which should be lowered to 0. Overall, the code poses no security threat.",
