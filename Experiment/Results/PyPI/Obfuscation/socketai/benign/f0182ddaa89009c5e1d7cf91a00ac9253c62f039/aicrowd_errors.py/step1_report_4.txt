{
  "purpose": "The code appears to list all error names and their corresponding exit codes.",
  "sources": "Potentially from error handling or exception definitions, possibly from standard library or custom error lists.",
  "sinks": "None evident; no data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks.",
  "flows": "N/A — no source-to-sink flow identified.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, no hardcoded secrets, or malicious constructs observed.",
  "analysis": "The code's primary function is to enumerate error names and their exit codes, likely for diagnostic or documentation purposes. It does not include any network activity, dynamic code execution, or data manipulation that could indicate malicious intent. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious behavior, and the structure appears straightforward.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving a listing or documentation function without any malicious behavior or security risks.",
