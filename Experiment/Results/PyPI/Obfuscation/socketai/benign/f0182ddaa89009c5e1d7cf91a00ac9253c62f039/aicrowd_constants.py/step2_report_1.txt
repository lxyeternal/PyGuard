  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a code snippet that is solely comments and constant definitions related to login and challenge commands.\n- No executable code, data processing, input/output, or network communication is present.\n- No hardcoded credentials, secrets, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), indicating the reviewers are certain about their assessments.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Presence of issues:** No. All reports agree that the code is just constants and comments with no executable or suspicious content.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** None apparent. The reports correctly identify the code as non-executable and benign.\n- **Scores assigned:** Malware and security risk scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the content.\n\n---\n\n### Specific points:\n- Since the code is only comments and constants with no logic, there is no scope for vulnerabilities, malicious activity, or obfuscation.\n- The high confidence scores are justified, and the lack of obfuscation and malware is consistent with the code description.\n- No changes are needed in the scores or conclusions.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity or code)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (no security risk identified)\n\n**Additional note:** Given the nature of the code, these scores are appropriate. Any higher scores would be unjustified.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\nThe reports are accurate and consistent. The code snippet is harmless, purely declarative, and poses no security threat.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the reviewers' assessments.",
