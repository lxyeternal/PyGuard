  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and determine the accuracy of their assessments, the appropriateness of their scores, and any potential issues.\n\n---\n\n**General Observations Across All Reports:**\n\n- All reports agree that the code is purely a constants declaration or comments with no executable logic, data processing, or input/output operations.\n- No suspicious, malicious, or obfuscated code is identified.\n- The confidence levels are high (mostly 0.9 to 1), which seems appropriate given the minimal content.\n- Malware scores are all 0, consistent with the absence of malicious behavior.\n- Security risk scores are all 0, which aligns with the nature of the code.\n\n---\n\n### Confirming the Issues Reported:\n\n- **Presence of Issues:** All reports correctly identify that the code contains only comments and constant definitions, with no executable code, data flows, or suspicious content.\n- **Malicious Behavior or Vulnerabilities:** None of the reports detect any malicious activity, vulnerabilities, or obfuscation.\n\n### Logical Flaws or Mistakes:\n\n- **No flaws in reasoning** are evident; all reports are consistent and cautious, emphasizing the benign nature of the code.\n- **Scores:** The scores assigned (malware=0, securityRisk=0, obfuscated=0) are appropriate given the content.\n\n### Specific Comments:\n\n- **On the scores:** Since the code is purely descriptive comments/constants with no logic, scores of 0 for malware, obfuscated, and risk are justified.\n- **On the confidence levels:** Given the minimal and non-executable nature, high confidence is reasonable.\n- **Potential for change:** No changes needed; the assessments are appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final Expert Evaluation:\n\n**Malware Score:** 0  \n**Obfuscated Score:** 0  \n**Security Risk Score:** 0\n\n**Rationale:** The code is a simple constants/comments file with no executable logic, no data flows, and no suspicious content. There are no signs of malicious activity or vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- All reports correctly identify the benign nature of the code.\n- Their scores are consistent and appropriate.\n- No further action or concern is warranted based on the provided code snippet.\n\n---\n\n**Final Recommendation:**  \nMaintain the current scores and confidence levels. No security issues are present in this constants file.",
