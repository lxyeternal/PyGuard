{
  "purpose": "Defines constants related to login and challenge commands, serving as configuration or documentation placeholders.",
  "sources": "Constants declarations and comments within the code file.",
  "sinks": "No data input, output, or untrusted data flows are present; the code contains only static constants and comments.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths exist due to the absence of executable or dynamic code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, suspicious patterns, or obfuscated code are present; the code is purely declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of comments and constant definitions related to login and challenge commands. No executable logic, data processing, input/output, or network communication is present. No hardcoded credentials, secrets, or obfuscation are observed. The high confidence scores (0.9 to 1) are justified given the non-executable, benign nature of the code. No vulnerabilities, malicious behavior, or suspicious patterns are identified. The scores for malware, obfuscation, and security risk are appropriately set to 0, reflecting the code's harmless and declarative nature.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, non-executable constants/configuration file with no malicious intent or security risks. All reports correctly assess its harmlessness, and the scores are appropriate. No further action or adjustments are necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
