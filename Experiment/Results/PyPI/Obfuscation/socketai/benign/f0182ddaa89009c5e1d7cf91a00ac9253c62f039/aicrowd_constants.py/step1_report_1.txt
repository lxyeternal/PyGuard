  "purpose": "Defines global constants related to login and challenge subcommands for a larger application.",
  "sources": "No data input or external data reading observed in the provided code.",
  "sinks": "No output, data processing, or external communication points identified.",
  "flows": "No source-to-sink data flows present.",
  "anomalies": "The code only contains comments and constant declarations; no suspicious or unusual code, no hardcoded credentials or secrets, no obfuscation, and no malicious behavior evident.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a minimal constants definition file with comments describing its purpose. There are no functions, no data handling, no input/output operations, and no code that could be exploited or that contains malicious behavior. It appears to be part of a larger codebase, serving as a configuration or constants module. Given the lack of executable or data-processing code, there are no security risks, malicious activities, or anomalies to identify.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a simple constants declaration file with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not contain any suspicious behavior or obfuscated code. No vulnerabilities or malicious activities are evident from the provided snippet.",
