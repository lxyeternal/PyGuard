  "purpose": "Define constants related to login and challenge subcommands",
  "sources": "No input or data reading observed in the provided code",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or data output points observed",
  "flows": "No data flow paths present",
  "anomalies": "The code is a simple constants definition with no executable logic; no anomalies detected",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward declaration of constants for login and challenge commands. It lacks input handling, data processing, or network communication. No suspicious or malicious code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, data exfiltration, or obfuscation, are present. The structure and content are typical for configuration or constant definitions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a basic constants declaration file with no signs of malicious behavior or security risks. It appears safe and purposeful for configuration purposes.",
