  "sinks": "Installation process, possibly invoking system commands, or writing files during build/install",
  "flows": "Build commands or scripts may read environment variables or files and execute system commands or write to disk",
  "anomalies": "Lack of explicit code; no clear build or install script provided. No suspicious commands or hardcoded secrets visible.",
  "analysis": "The provided statement is a high-level instruction with no actual code, script, or commands included. Without detailed build scripts, code, or command lines, it's impossible to identify malicious behavior or anomalies. The phrase suggests standard build and install procedures for a CLI tool, which are common in open-source projects. No suspicious patterns, hardcoded credentials, or malicious instructions are evident from the text alone. However, the absence of actual code prevents a thorough review.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided description, there is no evidence of malicious behavior. The statement appears to refer to standard build and installation procedures. However, a detailed review of actual build scripts or code would be necessary to confirm security.",
