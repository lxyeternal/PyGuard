  "sources": "No actual code, scripts, or commands provided; only high-level description",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources or sinks identified; no data leaks or effects evident",
  "flows": "No data flow paths available due to absence of code",
  "anomalies": "Lack of concrete code or scripts; only descriptive instructions; no suspicious patterns or secrets",
  "analysis": "The provided descriptions are minimal, lacking actual code snippets or commands. All reports correctly identify the absence of suspicious activity, malicious code, or security risks based on the limited information. Malware scores are consistently zero, obfuscated scores are zero, and risk scores are very low (~0.1-0.2), reflecting minimal concern. Confidence levels vary but are generally moderate due to the lack of detailed code. Given the absence of concrete code or suspicious indicators, the assessments are appropriate and conservative.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign with no evidence of malicious activity or security risks. The scores are justified based on the minimal information, and no adjustments are necessary. To improve security confidence, actual build scripts or code snippets should be reviewed.",
