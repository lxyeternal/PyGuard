  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General Observations:**\n- All reports are based on minimal or no actual code content, mostly describing the process as \"build and install CLI.\"\n- No explicit code snippets, commands, or scripts are provided.\n- No suspicious patterns, hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or malicious instructions are identified.\n- The descriptions suggest standard build and installation procedures typical in open-source projects.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Review:\n\n**Report 1:**\n- **Issues present?** No. The report states no suspicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The report correctly notes the lack of code and the benign nature.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.2. These seem reasonable given the minimal info.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 2:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Similar reasoning as Report 1.\n- **Errors or flaws?** The report acknowledges the lack of code and the standard process.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.2, confidence=0.3. Slightly higher risk score is acceptable due to the mention of environment variables and system commands, but without actual code, it's still low.\n- **Conclusion:** Justified.\n\n**Report 3:**\n- **Issues present?** No. No code or suspicious activity.\n- **Errors or flaws?** Correctly states that no malicious behavior is detected.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0, confidence=0.8. The high confidence might seem slightly overestimated given the minimal info, but since no code is provided, this is acceptable.\n- **Conclusion:** Appropriate.\n\n**Report 4:**\n- **Issues present?** No. Standard build process.\n- **Errors or flaws?** Accurate.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.5. The risk score is low, which aligns with the benign description.\n- **Conclusion:** Reasonable.\n\n**Report 5:**\n- **Issues present?** No.\n- **Errors or flaws?** Correct.\n- **Scores:** malware=0, risk=0.1, confidence=0.3. Appropriate given the minimal info.\n- **Conclusion:** Suitable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n- **Malware scores:** All zero, consistent with the lack of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated scores:** Zero, no signs of obfuscation.\n- **Risk scores:** Generally low, reflecting the minimal and benign descriptions.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- Since no actual code or scripts are provided, the risk scores could be slightly lowered in some cases, especially where confidence is high but no evidence exists.\n- The high confidence in Report 3 (0.8) might be marginally overstated; given the absence of code, a lower confidence (e.g., 0.5) might be more appropriate.\n- The scores are consistent with the reports' content.\n\n---\n\n### Final expert estimate:\n**Malware score:** 0 (no malicious activity detected)  \n**Obfuscated score:** 0 (no obfuscation detected)  \n**Risk score:** 0.1 (minimal, standard build process, no risks identified)\n\n**Summary:** All reports are benign and reflect standard build and installation procedures without any signs of security issues or malicious activity.",
