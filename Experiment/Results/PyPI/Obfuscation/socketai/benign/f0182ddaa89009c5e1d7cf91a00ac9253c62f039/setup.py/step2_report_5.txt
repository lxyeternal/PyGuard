  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, considering the evidence, reasoning, and scoring.\n\n**General observations:**\n- All reports describe a very minimal, generic instruction: \"Build and install the CLI.\"\n- No actual code, scripts, commands, or build files are provided.\n- The assessments consistently conclude that there is no malicious activity or security risk based solely on this minimal description.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations of issues:\n- **Presence of issues in code:** None. All reports lack concrete code or commands, so no issues can be confirmed.\n- **Errors or flaws in reasoning:** The reports correctly identify the absence of code, scripts, or suspicious patterns. Their reasoning that the minimal description does not suggest malicious activity is sound.\n\n### Score evaluations:\n- **Malware score:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is appropriate given the lack of any suspicious code or behavior.\n- **Obfuscated score:** All are 0, consistent with no obfuscation evidence.\n- **Security risk score:** Very low (mostly 0.1 to 0.2), reflecting the minimal risk based on the provided info.\n\n### Justification for risk scores:\n- Since there's no code, no suspicious commands, no hardcoded secrets, and no network activity, the risk scores are appropriately low.\n- The highest confidence score is 0.8 (Report 3), but even then, the reasoning aligns with the absence of actual code.\n\n### Potential issues or assumptions:\n- The reports assume that minimal descriptions equate to no malicious activity, which is reasonable.\n- They do not consider the possibility of malicious code hidden in build scripts or external files, but given only the provided text, this is acceptable.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- The scores seem reasonable and consistent with the evidence.\n- No adjustments needed unless actual code or scripts are provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 across all reports, justified.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0, justified.\n- **Risk score:** Very low (around 0.1–0.2), justified by the lack of concrete code or suspicious activity.\n\n**My own estimate:**  \nGiven the minimal descriptions, I agree with the current scores. If anything, I might suggest a slightly higher confidence in the safety (e.g., 0.9) because no code or suspicious activity is evident, but the current scores are already conservative and appropriate.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- All reports correctly identify the lack of concrete code or suspicious patterns.\n- The scores are reasonable and consistent.\n- No evidence suggests malicious activity or significant security risks based solely on the provided descriptions.\n\n**Final note:**  \nTo improve security assessment, actual build scripts, code snippets, or commands should be reviewed. As it stands, the process appears standard and benign.",
