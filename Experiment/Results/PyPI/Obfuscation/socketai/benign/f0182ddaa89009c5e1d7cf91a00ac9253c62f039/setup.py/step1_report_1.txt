  "sources": "No explicit data sources identified; the code appears to be a build and installation script",
  "sinks": "No explicit sinks; no data leaks, network connections, or sensitive operations evident",
  "flows": "No data flow from untrusted sources to sinks observed; primarily build and installation commands",
  "anomalies": "Lack of actual implementation details; the description is minimal and generic, no suspicious code patterns or hardcoded secrets found",
  "analysis": "The code snippet provided only states 'Build and install the CLI', which suggests a build and installation process, likely involving standard build tools or setup scripts. Without actual code content or commands, there are no indications of malicious behavior, data leakage, or security risks. The minimal description does not reveal any anomalies, suspicious imports, or code execution patterns. It appears to be a benign instruction rather than executable code.",
  "conclusion": "Based solely on the provided statement, there are no signs of malicious activity or security risks. The description is generic and lacks detailed code that could contain malicious logic. Therefore, the code appears safe, with no suspicious signals detected.",
