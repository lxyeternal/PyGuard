  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n1. **Report 1**  \n   - **Assessment:** The report states that the code is a straightforward custom exception class with no malicious behavior. The code is purely declarative, with no data flows, external interactions, or suspicious patterns.  \n   - **Score justification:** Malware score 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — aligns with the analysis.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No issues, the report's reasoning is sound.\n\n2. **Report 2**  \n   - **Assessment:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing that the code is only comments and class description, not executable logic. No data handling or external interactions.  \n   - **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** The report correctly identifies the benign nature.\n\n3. **Report 3**  \n   - **Assessment:** Notes that the code is fragmentary, only comments and class description, with no executable code or data flow. No malicious intent detected.  \n   - **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — consistent.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No security concern here.\n\n4. **Report 4**  \n   - **Assessment:** Similar to others, it describes the code as a class structure with no data handling or external interactions. No malicious behavior.  \n   - **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — justified.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No issues.\n\n5. **Report 5**  \n   - **Assessment:** Again, a benign class definition with no data processing, external calls, or suspicious patterns.  \n   - **Score justification:** Malware 0, obfuscated 0, security risk 0 — appropriate.  \n   - **Conclusion:** No concerns.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Summary:\n- **Code presence:** All reports correctly identify that the code is just a class declaration with comments, not executable logic.\n- **Malware risk:** All reports assign a malware score of 0, which is justified.\n- **Obfuscation:** No obfuscation detected; all scores are 0.\n- **Security risk:** No security issues or vulnerabilities are present based on the provided snippets.\n\n### Final assessment:\n- The scores assigned across all reports are consistent with the code's benign nature.\n- No changes needed; the reasoning is sound.\n- The code itself poses no security risk or malware threat.\n\n### My own estimate:\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThe code is a standard, harmless exception class definition with no malicious or security concerns.",
