  "purpose": "Define a base class for all CLI exceptions to handle errors uniformly and provide messaging, fix suggestions, and exit codes.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code is a class definition with comments and argument descriptions.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow involving untrusted input; the code only defines an exception class structure.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code behavior, hardcoded secrets, or suspicious patterns detected.",
  "analysis": "The code provides a class comment and argument descriptions for a CLI exception class. It lacks actual executable code or data handling. There are no signs of malicious intent, no input/output processing, and no suspicious behaviors. The comments are standard and informative, with no hidden or malicious instructions.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward class documentation and definition for CLI exceptions, with no malicious or security concern signals.",
