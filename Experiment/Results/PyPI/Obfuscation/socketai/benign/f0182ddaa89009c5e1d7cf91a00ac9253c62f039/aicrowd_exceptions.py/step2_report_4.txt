  "review": "Let's analyze the reports and the code snippets they describe carefully.\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code:**\n   - All reports describe the code as a class definition or documentation for a base exception class (`CLIException`) used in CLI applications.\n   - The code appears to be purely declarative, consisting of comments and class structure without executable logic.\n   - No untrusted data input, output, or external system interactions are observed.\n   - No anomalies, obfuscation, or suspicious patterns are detected.\n   - Based on the reports, the code is benign and standard for exception handling.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports:**\n   - The reports are consistent in stating that the code is either a class definition or documentation.\n   - They correctly identify the absence of executable logic, data flows, or external interactions.\n   - No logical errors or misconceptions are evident.\n   - The only minor point is that some reports note the code as incomplete or fragmentary, but this is typical for documentation snippets.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue:**\n   - All reports assign malware, obfuscated, and security risk scores as zero, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n   - Confidence levels are high (mostly 1), appropriate given the straightforward nature of the code.\n   - No adjustments are necessary; the scores seem reasonable.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5:**\n   - Since all reports assign a risk score of 0, and the code is purely documentation or class structure without executable logic, there's no justification for higher scores.\n   - No malicious behavior, data leaks, or vulnerabilities are indicated.\n\n5. **Malware Score Consideration:**\n   - The malware score is zero across all reports.\n   - The code does not perform any actions that could be malicious, such as executing external commands, handling untrusted input improperly, or including obfuscated code.\n   - The reports correctly reflect this.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions:**\n   - All claims are cautious and based on the absence of executable or suspicious code.\n   - No unwarranted assumptions about vulnerabilities are made.\n\n7. **Score Consistency:**\n   - The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, obfuscation, or security risks detected.\n   - The confidence levels match the thoroughness of the review.\n\n**Final Assessment:**\n\n- **Malware Score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0\n- **Risk Score:** 0\n\nThe code is a benign, standard exception class or documentation snippet with no security concerns.\n\n**Summary:**\nThe code snippets reviewed are simple class definitions or documentation for CLI exception handling, with no malicious or security-related issues. The scores assigned are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.",
