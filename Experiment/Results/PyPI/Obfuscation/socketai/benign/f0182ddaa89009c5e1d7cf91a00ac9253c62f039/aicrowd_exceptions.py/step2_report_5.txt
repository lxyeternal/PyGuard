  "review": "Let's analyze the reports carefully:\n\n1. **Presence of Issues in the Code**:  \n   All reports describe the code as a class definition with only comments and attribute descriptions, with no executable logic, data handling, or external interactions. They confirm that the code is benign, primarily serving as documentation or a placeholder for a base exception class.\n\n2. **Errors, Flaws, or Mistakes in the Reports**:  \n   The reports are consistent and accurate in their assessments. They correctly identify that the code is a straightforward class definition with no malicious behavior, no data flows, and no security concerns. No logical flaws or mistakes are evident in their reasoning.\n\n3. **Scores Given to Each Issue**:  \n   All reports assign a malware score of 0, obfuscated score of 0, and security risk of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code. Their confidence levels are high (mostly 1), which is reasonable given the simplicity and clarity of the code.\n\n4. **Justification for Risk Scores > 0.5**:  \n   Since all reports agree that the code is purely structural, with no executable or external interaction, a risk score higher than 0.5 would be unjustified. The scores of 0 or very close to it are appropriate.\n\n5. **Malware Score Reflection**:  \n   The malware score is 0 across all reports, correctly indicating no malicious activity. The code does not perform any actions that could be considered malicious.\n\n6. **Claims Based on Assumptions**:  \n   All reports avoid making unwarranted assumptions; they correctly state that the code is a benign class definition, likely part of a larger codebase, but not malicious itself.\n\n7. **Score Consistency**:  \n   The scores are consistent with the analysis: no malware, no obfuscation, and no security risk.\n\n---\n\n### Final Evaluation and Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware, Obfuscated, and Risk Scores**:  \n  Given the evidence, I would assign the following scores:\n  - **Malware Score**: 0  \n  - **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n  - **Security Risk Score**: 0  \n\n- **Additional Considerations**:  \n  The code appears to be a standard, well-documented exception class intended for error handling in CLI applications. It is not executable on its own and contains no suspicious patterns or behaviors.\n\n### **Summary**:  \nAll reports correctly identify the code as benign, with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are appropriate, and no adjustments are necessary.\n\n**Final verdict:**  \n- **Malware Score**: 0  \n- **Obfuscated Score**: 0  \n- **Risk Score**: 0\n\nThis code fragment is safe and standard for exception handling in Python CLI applications.",
