  "purpose": "Definition and documentation of CLI exception classes for error handling in a command-line interface application.",
  "sources": "None; the code only contains class documentation and exception inheritance.",
  "sinks": "None; no untrusted data processing or external interactions are present.",
  "flows": "None; no data flow from sources to sinks exists in this snippet.",
  "anomalies": "The code appears to be incomplete or fragmentary, with only comments and class description; no executable or complex logic is present.",
  "analysis": "The provided code is a partial class description for CLI exceptions, mainly serving as documentation. It does not contain executable code, input handling, or external interactions. There are no indications of hardcoded secrets, malicious code, or abnormal behavior. The absence of operational code makes detection of malicious intent impossible. The snippet seems to be part of a larger codebase, focusing on exception hierarchy.",
  "conclusion": "This code fragment is benign, consisting solely of descriptive comments and a base class for CLI exceptions. There is no malicious behavior, no data leakage, and no security risks evident from this fragment.",
