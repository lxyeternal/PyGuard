  "purpose": "Define a base exception class for CLI applications with descriptive comments about error messages, fixes, and exit codes.",
  "sources": "Comments describing class purpose, arguments, and usage; class declaration.",
  "sinks": "None; no data input, output, or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; code is declarative with no executable logic or data flow.",
  "anomalies": "Absence of executable code, data handling, or suspicious patterns; purely comments and class structure.",
  "analysis": "The code is a class definition with descriptive comments, serving as a documentation or placeholder for CLI exception handling. No executable logic, data processing, or external interactions are present. The code is benign, with no signs of malicious behavior, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The reports correctly identify the code as a simple class declaration, and the assigned scores of malware 0, obfuscated 0, and security risk 0 are appropriate. Confidence in this assessment is high, given the lack of executable or suspicious elements.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a benign, standard exception class definition with no malicious intent or security concerns. The scores are consistent with its nature, and no further action is necessary.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
