  "purpose": "Defines a base class for CLI-related exceptions, providing structure for error messages, fixes, and exit codes.",
  "sources": "No input data or external data sources are read in this code.",
  "sinks": "No data or control flow sinks are present; no untrusted data handling or output is performed.",
  "flows": "No data flow from input to output; code only defines a class structure.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or suspicious code behaviors detected; the code is straightforward class definition.",
  "analysis": "The code is a simple documentation and class structure for exceptions in a CLI application. It contains no data input, no external calls, and no execution logic beyond class declaration. There are no signs of malicious behavior, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscation. Its purpose is to serve as an exception base class, which is common and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard exception class definition with no malicious intent or security risks. It does not process data, perform network operations, or contain any suspicious constructs.",
