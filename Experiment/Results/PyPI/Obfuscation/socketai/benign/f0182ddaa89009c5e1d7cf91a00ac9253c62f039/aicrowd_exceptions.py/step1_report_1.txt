  "purpose": "Define a base class for exceptions raised by a CLI application, including documentation about its use and attributes.",
  "sources": "The code is a class definition with a constructor (not shown explicitly but implied), providing exception attributes.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data input, output, or external system interaction observed.",
  "flows": "Not applicable; no data flows or processing logic present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, unusual code patterns, or suspicious behavior detected.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a straightforward definition of a custom exception class intended for CLI error handling. It contains descriptive comments explaining its purpose and arguments. There are no signs of code injection, malicious logic, or obfuscated code. The snippet is purely declarative, defining an exception class, which is common in Python projects. No external data or network interactions are involved.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, benign exception class definition with no malicious behavior or security concerns.",
