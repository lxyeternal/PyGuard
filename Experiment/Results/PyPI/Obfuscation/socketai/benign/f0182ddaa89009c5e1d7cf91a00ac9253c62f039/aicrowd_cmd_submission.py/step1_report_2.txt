  "purpose": "The code provides CLI command descriptions and usage examples for creating and viewing submissions on AIcrowd platform.",
  "sources": "The command-line inputs and parameters specified in the usage examples",
  "sinks": "Potentially any subprocess or API calls made during command execution; however, no actual code execution or data handling is shown",
  "flows": "User input (command-line arguments) → CLI commands → submission creation process (not explicitly shown in code)",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, obfuscated code, or hidden behaviors observed; purely descriptive command examples",
  "analysis": "The provided text is a documentation or help message detailing CLI commands and options for interacting with the AIcrowd platform. It includes example commands for creating submissions, specifying challenge IDs, files, and descriptions. No code logic, data processing, or executable components are present. As it is purely descriptive, there are no source-to-sink data flows, no input handling beyond command arguments, and no signs of malicious activity or suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a straightforward CLI usage documentation with no executable code or data processing, posing no security risk or malware threat.",
