  "purpose": "Documentation or help message describing how to create and view submissions on AIcrowd, including command-line examples.",
  "sources": "None; this is static text with no data input or external data reading.",
  "sinks": "None; there are no data sinks or untrusted data processing.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code is purely informational and does not process data dynamically.",
  "anomalies": "Contains command-line example strings, but nothing unusual or malicious in the context of documentation.",
  "analysis": "The code is a descriptive text block outlining commands for submitting and viewing submissions on AIcrowd. It includes example commands with parameters such as -J, -f, -d, and -t, but these are standard command-line options for user guidance. There is no executable code, data processing, or external interactions. No hardcoded secrets, environment variable usage, or suspicious patterns are present. The content appears to be straightforward documentation.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code is a static help message or documentation with example commands. It poses no security risks, malicious intent, or anomalous behavior. It is safe and typical for command-line tool documentation.",
