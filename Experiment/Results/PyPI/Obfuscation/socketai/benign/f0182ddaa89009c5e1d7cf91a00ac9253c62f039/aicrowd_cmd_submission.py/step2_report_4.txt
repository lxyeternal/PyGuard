  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**Overall Observations:**\n- All reports describe static documentation or command-line usage examples.\n- No executable code, scripts, or data processing logic is present.\n- No signs of obfuscation, hardcoded secrets, or malicious patterns.\n- The \"malware\" score is consistently 0 across all reports.\n- The \"securityRisk\" score is also 0, indicating no apparent security concerns.\n- The confidence levels are high (0.9 to 1), supporting the benign interpretation.\n\n**Specific points:**\n- The reports correctly identify that these are command-line instructions or documentation, not code with logic or data flow.\n- No anomalies, suspicious behaviors, or malicious intent are detected.\n- The inputs are command-line parameters, which, in the context of documentation, are benign.\n\n**Scores review:**\n- The malware scores are all 0, which aligns with the analysis.\n- The obfuscated scores are 0, consistent with the lack of obfuscation.\n- The security risk scores are 0, matching the benign nature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n- The given scores are reasonable and justified.\n- Since there is no actual code execution, data handling, or network activity, the risk, malware, and obfuscation scores should remain at 0.\n- The reports correctly interpret the content as documentation, not executable or malicious code.\n\n**My own estimate:**\n- **Malware score:** 0\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0\n- **Risk score:** 0\n\nThis aligns with the current assessments and the nature of the content.\n\n**Final note:**\n- No further action needed; the content is safe and purely instructional.",
