  "flows": "Input from command-line or environment variables -> processing functions -> output to console or files.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, suspicious functions, or malicious patterns detected. No obfuscated code, no dynamic execution, or hidden backdoors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code appears to be a standard CLI setup for AIcrowd, involving argument parsing and possibly some basic validation or API calls. No suspicious patterns, external network connections, or malicious logic are present in the provided fragment. Without additional code, no malicious behavior is evident.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the given code snippet, there are no indications of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears to serve a legitimate purpose as a CLI tool for AIcrowd interactions.",
