  "purpose": "Command-line interface for interacting with AIcrowd platform functionalities",
  "sources": "Reads command-line arguments and user input, accesses environment variables",
  "sinks": "Potentially executes commands based on user input, prints output to console",
  "flows": "User input -> Argument parsing -> Function calls -> Output or environment variable access",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or suspicious command executions; code appears standard for CLI tools",
  "analysis": "The code appears to implement a CLI for AIcrowd with argument parsing, environment variable handling, and standard I/O operations. No obfuscated or malicious code patterns such as dynamic code execution or data exfiltration are evident. No hardcoded secrets or unusual data flows are detected. Usage of third-party libraries is typical for such CLI tools. The code follows expected patterns for command-line applications and does not contain any suspicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided analysis, the code does not exhibit malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a standard CLI tool for AIcrowd interactions with no signs of malware or malicious intent.",
