{
  "purpose": "Define string literals for different algorithm or method options, likely for use in a larger text processing or matching library.",
  "sources": "No input sources; the code only defines type aliases with string literals.",
  "sinks": "No sinks; no data processing, output, or untrusted data handling present.",
  "flows": "No data flow; the code only defines type annotations without execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; the code strictly defines type literals with no suspicious or unusual behavior.",
  "analysis": "The code imports annotations and Literal from typing, then defines three Literal type aliases containing specific string options. These definitions appear to serve as constrained options for other parts of a program, facilitating type checking and code clarity. There are no functions, data input/output, or any executable logic. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious constructs are present. The code does not perform any operations, network access, or data handling that could pose security risks.",
  "conclusion": "This code segment is a straightforward declaration of string literal types for a larger application. It shows no signs of malicious intent or security risks. It is purely structural, likely used for type safety and code readability.",
