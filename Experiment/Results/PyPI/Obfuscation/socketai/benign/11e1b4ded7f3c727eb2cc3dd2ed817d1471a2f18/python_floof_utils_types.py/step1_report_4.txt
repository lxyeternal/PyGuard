  "purpose": "Define string literals for various string similarity metrics, vectorizer types, and phonetic algorithms.",
  "sources": "None; the code only defines type annotations and string literals.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external data usage is present.",
  "flows": "No data flows or untrusted data sources to sinks are evident in the code.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies detected; the code is straightforward and contains only type annotations.",
  "analysis": "The code imports typing annotations and defines several Literal types representing names of similarity algorithms, vectorizers, and phonetic algorithms. There are no functions, data processing, input/output, or external communications. The code appears to serve as type hints or configuration options for a larger application. No suspicious or malicious patterns are present. It does not contain obfuscation or dynamic code execution.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, consisting solely of type annotations for string literals representing various algorithms. There are no signs of malicious behavior or security risks.",
