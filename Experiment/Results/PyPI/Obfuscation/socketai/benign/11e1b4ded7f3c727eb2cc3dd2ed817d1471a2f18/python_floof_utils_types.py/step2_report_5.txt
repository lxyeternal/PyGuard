  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully:\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n\n- All reports describe the code as defining string literal types for various algorithms and options, with no data processing, input/output, or external interactions.\n- The code is static, consisting solely of type alias declarations, with no functions, logic, or dynamic behavior.\n- No suspicious constructs, obfuscation, or malicious patterns are identified.\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, which aligns with the benign nature of the code.\n- The confidence scores are all 1, indicating high certainty in the benign assessment.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present in the code?**  \n  Yes. The reports correctly identify that the code only defines type aliases with string literals for configuration purposes. No malicious or suspicious behavior is present.\n\n### Flaws or mistakes in the reports:\n- The reports are consistent and thorough. They correctly interpret the code as benign, purely declarative, and serve as type hints or constants for larger projects.\n- No logical errors or reasoning flaws are evident.\n- The scores for malware and security risk are appropriate and consistent with the code's nature.\n\n### Score suggestions:\n- The malware scores are all 0, which is appropriate given the benign, static nature of the code.\n- The risk scores are all 0, which is justified.\n\n### Justification for risk scores higher than 0.5:\n- Not applicable here; all scores are correctly set to 0, reflecting no security concern.\n\n### Malware score considerations:\n- Since the code contains only type alias declarations with string literals, there is no malicious activity, code injection, or obfuscation.\n- The malware score remains at 0, which is justified.\n\n### Challenging assumptions:\n- The reports assume no malicious intent based on static type alias definitions. This is reasonable and consistent with the code.\n\n### Consistency of scores:\n- The scores are consistent with the code content and the analysis provided.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n- **Malware score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 (correct)\n- **Risk score:** 0 (correct)\n\n### Overall conclusion:\nThe reports are accurate and well-founded. The code is benign, purely defining string literal types for configuration or type checking purposes, with no security risks or malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0  \n- **Obfuscated:** 0  \n- **Risk:** 0  \n\nThe code is straightforward, static, and serves as type hints, with no vulnerabilities or malicious features.",
