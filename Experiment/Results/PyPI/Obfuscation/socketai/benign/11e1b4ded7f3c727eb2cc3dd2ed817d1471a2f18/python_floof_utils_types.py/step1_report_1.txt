{
  "purpose": "Define string literal types for various similarity and phonetic algorithms, likely for use as configuration or options in a larger application.",
  "sources": "None explicitly; the code only defines type aliases with string literals.",
  "sinks": "None; no data processing, input/output, or external interactions present.",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; code purely declares type aliases.",
  "anomalies": "The code is minimal, purely defining type annotations. No suspicious constructs, hidden code, or obfuscated elements present.",
  "analysis": "The code imports future annotations and typing.Literal, then declares several Literal type aliases representing algorithm names. There are no functions, data processing, or external interactions. It appears to serve as configuration or type hints within a larger codebase. No suspicious or malicious patterns are evident. The code is straightforward and does not contain any behaviors that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a benign set of type alias definitions for string literals related to similarity and phonetic algorithms. No malicious intent or security risks are evident based on this code fragment.",
