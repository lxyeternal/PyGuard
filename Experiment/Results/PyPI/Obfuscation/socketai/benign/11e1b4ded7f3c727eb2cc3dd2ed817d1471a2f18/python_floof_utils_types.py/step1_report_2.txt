  "purpose": "Define type annotations for string literals related to string similarity and phonetic algorithms.",
  "sources": "Literal type declarations using string literals, no input reading or data processing observed.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data outputs, no untrusted data handling identified.",
  "flows": "No data flows or source-to-sink paths present.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies, hardcoded string literals appear to be for configuration or type hints, no suspicious code structures.",
  "analysis": "The code imports 'Literal' for type annotations, then defines several literal types representing algorithm names or options for string comparison and phonetic encoding. These are purely type hints, with no executable logic, input handling, or data processing. There are no signs of malicious code, data exfiltration, or suspicious behavior. The code appears to serve as a part of a larger type-annotated project or library. No obfuscation or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code is solely type annotation declarations for string literals related to string similarity and phonetic algorithms. There is no malicious intent, no suspicious behavior, and no security risks evident.",
