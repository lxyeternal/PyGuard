{
  "purpose": "Define literal types for string constants related to string similarity algorithms, feature extraction methods, and phonetic encoding algorithms.",
  "sources": "Hardcoded string literals assigned to variables.",
  "sinks": "No external data input or output operations detected.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only declares constants.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies observed; code appears to be type annotations and constant definitions.",
  "analysis": "The code imports type annotations, then defines multiple Literal types with specific string values, likely for use elsewhere in a larger codebase. No dynamic execution, input handling, or external data manipulation present. The code is static, configuration-like, and does not perform any operations that could be malicious.",
  "conclusion": "This source code consists solely of type annotations and constant definitions for string identifiers. There is no malicious behavior, no suspicious data handling, and no evident security risks. It appears to be part of a larger project, serving as type hints or constants.",
