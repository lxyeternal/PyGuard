  "purpose": "Define string literal types for similarity and phonetic algorithms used in string processing.",
  "sources": "No data sources; static type alias definitions using Literal.",
  "sinks": "No data sinks; no data processing or external interactions.",
  "flows": "None; purely static type definitions.",
  "anomalies": "None; code is straightforward, static, and declarative.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of type alias definitions for string options related to similarity and phonetic algorithms. There are no functions, data handling, or dynamic behaviors. No obfuscation, malicious patterns, or suspicious constructs are present. The malware score is 0, security risk is 0, and confidence is high (1), consistent with the benign nature of the code.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as configuration or type hints for larger codebases. It poses no security threat or malicious intent. All reports correctly assess this, and their scores are appropriate.",
  "confidence": 1,
  "obfuscated": 0,
