No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or malicious code structures are evident. The functions seem straightforward in their string processing logic.\",\n  \"analysis\": \"The code defines several functions for string similarity, normalization, and list processing. 'RfQoaeksBeaSkHhsBrKQpXacZmWAlRHk' and 'HAABeTcyvOBFcQtgHQnxrqXKgjxIceyx' invoke a callable with input strings and process the result, possibly measuring similarity or difference. 'EXjsZcyrSmfgDAMXFYkQaJoXwbuOtvbb' compares the outputs of the callable, returning a percentage, indicating a similarity check. 'jRCjbsNGsYjmhwcMqMEQrDIMGFpFelkh' normalizes a list of floats to sum to 1. 'RuJJRrLiKhbFMFHlALMOhhMAipFoKbUN' removes punctuation based on regex and splits strings into chunks, suggesting text preprocessing. All operations are typical string and list manipulations, with no suspicious network activity, hidden backdoors, or malicious payloads present.\",\n  \"conclusion\": \"The code appears to be a set of text processing utilities, including similarity metrics and normalization, without any malicious intent. No anomalies or suspicious behaviors are detected. The functions are straightforward, and there's no evidence of malware or harmful side effects.\",\n  \"confidence\": 0.9,\n  \"obfuscated\": 0,\n  \"malware\": 0,\n  \"securityRisk\": 0.2\n}",
