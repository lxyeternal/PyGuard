  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n**General observations across all reports:**\n- All reports identify that the code only performs import statements from internal modules with obfuscated or non-descriptive names.\n- No evidence of data flow, network activity, or malicious payloads is present in the snippets.\n- The primary concern is the obfuscation of identifiers and the use of internal modules, which could be benign or malicious depending on context.\n- The malware scores are low (mostly 0.1–0.2), indicating little to no evidence of malicious intent based solely on these snippets.\n- The obfuscated scores are high (around 0.7–0.8), reflecting suspicion due to naming.\n\n---\n\n### Confirmations:\n- **Are the reported issues present?**  \n  Yes. All reports correctly note that the code only imports obfuscated internal modules/functions, with no other behavior visible.\n\n- **Are there errors, flaws, or mistakes?**  \n  No explicit errors are evident. The reports correctly interpret the code as benign on the surface but flag obfuscation as suspicious.\n\n- **Are the scores reasonable?**  \n  The scores assigned seem consistent with the observations:\n  - Malware scores are low, reflecting no direct malicious activity.\n  - Obfuscated scores are high, aligning with the suspicion of obfuscation.\n  - Security risks are modest, as import statements alone are not inherently dangerous.\n\n---\n\n### Critical evaluation:\n- The reports are cautious but not overly alarmist, which is appropriate given the limited code.\n- The suspicion due to obfuscation is justified, but without further context or inspection of the imported modules, the risk remains low.\n- The malware scores could be slightly increased if there were additional context indicating malicious behavior, but based solely on these snippets, they are appropriately low.\n\n### Recommendations:\n- **Scores for malware** should remain low unless further analysis of the imported modules reveals malicious code.\n- **Obfuscated scores** should stay high due to the naming patterns.\n- **Risk scores** should stay moderate (around 0.2–0.3), reflecting the cautious stance but acknowledging the lack of direct evidence.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0.1 – 0.2 (consistent with the reports; no evidence of malicious code)\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.75 (average of reported obfuscation suspicion)\n- **Risk:** 0.2 – 0.3 (moderate due to obfuscation but no active malicious behavior)\n\n**Conclusion:**  \nThe code is suspicious primarily because of obfuscated identifiers and internal module usage, but there is no direct evidence of malicious activity. Further inspection of the imported modules is recommended to confirm their content.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \nThe reports are accurate in their cautious approach. The scores are reasonable given the evidence. I would maintain the current scoring framework but suggest close monitoring and further review of the imported modules before making any definitive security claims.",
