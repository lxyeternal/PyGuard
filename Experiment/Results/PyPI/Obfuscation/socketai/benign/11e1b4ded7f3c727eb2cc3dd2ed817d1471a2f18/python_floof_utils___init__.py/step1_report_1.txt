{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a Python module designed for data processing or utility functions, with no explicit comments indicating its primary function.",
  "sources": "Input data may come from user inputs, environment variables, or file reads (though no explicit input functions are shown). No clear source of untrusted data identified.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks could include network connections, file writes, or execution commands, but none are explicitly present in the visible code.",
  "flows": "No evident data flows from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks are observed within the code fragment.",
  "anomalies": "No suspicious or unusual code patterns, such as hardcoded credentials, obfuscated code, or dynamic execution, are apparent.",
  "analysis": "The code is straightforward, using standard library functions, with no signs of malicious intent or security issues. It does not include obfuscated elements or malicious network activities. The absence of external data handling, network calls, or secret management suggests no malicious behavior. Due to lack of external context, confidence remains high that this is benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code does not demonstrate any malicious behavior or security risks. It appears to be a benign utility or processing module with no signs of malware or security concerns.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
