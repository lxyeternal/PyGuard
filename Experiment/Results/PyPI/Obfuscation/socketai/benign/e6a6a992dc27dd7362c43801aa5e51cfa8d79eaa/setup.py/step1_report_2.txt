  "purpose": "Define a Python package setup configuration for distribution with specified dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Static data in the setup() function parameters: package name, version, license, modules, dependencies, classifiers.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data inputs or external data sinks present.",
  "flows": "No dynamic data flow or untrusted data movement observed.",
  "anomalies": "Package name appears random and non-descriptive; no hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious logic. The code is straightforward and standard for Python package setup.",
  "analysis": "The code imports setuptools and calls setup() with fixed string literals for package metadata and dependencies. The package name 'puqi1fr09imwqy2d' looks like a randomly generated string but does not indicate malicious intent. Dependencies are versioned but not suspicious. No dynamic code execution, no obfuscated logic, and no external data handling. The code conforms to typical Python package setup patterns without anomalies or hidden behaviors.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard Python package setup script with no signs of malicious behavior or supply chain threats. The unusual package name does not pose a security risk but may be intended for obfuscation or testing purposes. Overall, the script appears benign.",
