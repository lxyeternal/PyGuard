      "conclusion": "The code is benign, representing a standard setup script with an obfuscated package name. The low malware and risk scores are appropriate. The obfuscated name warrants cautious review but does not indicate malicious intent. Overall, the supply chain security posture is minimal risk."

      "conclusion": "The code is a sophisticated, heavily obfuscated middleware for WebSocket and grip protocol handling. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity such as network exfiltration, backdoors, or destructive routines. The main concern is the obfuscation, which could be used to hide malicious payloads or behavior. Static analysis suggests a low malware likelihood but a moderate security risk due to concealment potential. Further runtime or source integrity checks are recommended before deployment in security-sensitive environments."
