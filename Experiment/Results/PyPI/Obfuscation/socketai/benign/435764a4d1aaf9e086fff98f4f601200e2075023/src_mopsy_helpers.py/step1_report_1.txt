  "purpose": "The code provides utility functions for statistical operations on numpy arrays or sparse matrices, such as sum, mean, and median, with support for specifying axes and filtering non-zero elements.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from function parameters 'YDcuHZuERZXSZCjbfOOJPoKcdvoSUwNb' which can be numpy.ndarray or scipy.sparse.spmatrix, and from 'non_zero' flags that control filtering.",
  "sinks": "Data flows through functions like 'mqgjKElGKcDBkjzqXZnfFSlrjUVombOq' which calls methods on objects created by 'aSkpqAkQvguYBXFtcXYVUKxONQhcUHIQ'. No explicit output or network communication is directly observable.",
  "flows": "Input data is processed by 'aSkpqAkQvguYBXFtcXYVUKxONQhcUHIQ' to filter non-zero elements, then passed to 'mqgjKElGKcDBkjzqXZnfFSlrjUVombOq' with the specified statistical function and axis. The results are returned from the wrapper functions.",
  "anomalies": "Variable and function names appear obfuscated or auto-generated, which could be a sign of hiding purpose. The code imports non-standard modules with opaque names, and the core processing relies on external functions 'aSkpqAkQvguYBXFtcXYVUKxONQhcUHIQ' and 'QMIEJsNyuwokArJWHYuojQABXdZAvfBt'. These obscure names and indirection can mask malicious intent. No explicit malicious actions such as network communication, file modification, or credential handling are present in the code itself.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of statistical utility functions that perform sum, mean, and median computations over numpy or sparse matrices, with optional filtering of zero entries. The main processing function 'mqgjKElGKcDBkjzqXZnfFSlrjUVombOq' takes a function (e.g., sum, mean, median) and applies it along specified axes after filtering. The obfuscated variable and function names suggest possible code hiding or obfuscation techniques, but there is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network activity. The external modules are imported with unclear names, making it difficult to assess their behavior fully. However, based solely on this code snippet, there is no direct indication of malicious activity or malware.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a set of obfuscated statistical utility functions for numpy and sparse matrices. While the obfuscated naming raises suspicion, there is no evident malicious intent or malicious behavior such as data theft, network communication, or system compromise in this snippet. The use of opaque external modules warrants caution, but no direct security risks are observable from this fragment.",
