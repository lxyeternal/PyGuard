{
  "purpose": "The code provides statistical utility functions (sum, mean, median) for numpy arrays or sparse matrices, wrapped with obfuscated function and variable names, relying on external modules with opaque implementations.",
  "sources": "Input data from numpy.ndarray or scipy.sparse.spmatrix objects, accessed via external utility functions.",
  "sinks": "The functions process data internally; no direct sinks like network or file I/O are present, but external modules could potentially be malicious if compromised.",
  "flows": "Data flows from input arrays through external utility functions, then into core statistical functions via the wrapper functions, with obfuscated control flow and external dependencies.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of function and variable names, reliance on external modules with opaque implementations, no comments or documentation, potential concealment of malicious code.",
  "analysis": "The code defines multiple statistical functions that wrap a core processing function, applying operations like sum, mean, and median along specified axes. The obfuscated naming and opaque external modules ('checkutils', 'utils') raise suspicion but do not provide evidence of malicious intent. No network activity, file access, or credential handling is visible. The external modules' content is unknown, which warrants caution. The obfuscation could be for legitimate reasons or conceal malicious code. Given the absence of concrete malicious actions, the functions appear to serve as data processing utilities, with obfuscation being the primary concern.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated statistical utility functions relying on external modules with unknown content. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and opaque dependencies warrant cautious review. The malware score is set low, consistent with the lack of malicious activity, while the obfuscation score is high due to naming. The security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation. Further investigation into the external modules is recommended before deployment.",
