  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated statistical utility functions relying on external modules with unknown content. There is no direct evidence of malicious behavior, but the obfuscation and opaque dependencies warrant cautious review. The malware score is set low, consistent with the lack of malicious activity, while the obfuscation score is high due to naming. The security risk is moderate, primarily due to obfuscation. Further investigation into the external modules is recommended before deployment."
