  "flows": "Import from setuptools -> Execution of imported module as a function with parameters.",
  "anomalies": "The module name 'SVBkyFpcuFLvGjvRYncqIqhWZNpjeQDa' appears as a random string, which is suspicious and may indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. The except block is empty except for a print statement with no message, which is unusual. The code attempts to execute a module that may not exist or may be maliciously crafted.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a module with a nonsensical name from setuptools, which is a legitimate package manager. However, the module name appears to be obfuscated or randomly generated, which is suspicious. The main block tries to call this module as a function, passing a parameter 'use_scm_version'. If an error occurs, it prints nothing and re-raises the exception. This pattern could be used to hide malicious code or execute unintended behavior. The lack of specific error handling and the obfuscated module name raise concerns about hidden functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears suspicious due to the obfuscated module name and unusual import/use pattern. It could be benign, but the obfuscation and handling suggest possible malicious intent or at least malicious obfuscation. Further investigation into the module's source is recommended before use.",
