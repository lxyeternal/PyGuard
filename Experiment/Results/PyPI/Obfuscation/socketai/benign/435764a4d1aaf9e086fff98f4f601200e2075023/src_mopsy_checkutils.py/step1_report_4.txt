{
  "purpose": "Define a function that validates if the 'axis' parameter is either 0 or 1.",
  "sources": "None explicitly, as the code does not read external input or data sources; only variable assignments and a function parameter.",
  "sinks": "The code raises a ValueError with a formatted message, which is a controlled exception handling mechanism.",
  "flows": "The only flow is a validation check within the function that raises an exception if 'axis' is not 0 or 1.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of seemingly random variable names, but no malicious behavior. No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or suspicious code activities are detected.",
  "analysis": "The code declares three variables with obfuscated or nonsensical names assigned to string literals, which do not contribute to malicious behavior. The function 'QMIEJsNyuwokArJWHYuojQABXdZAvfBt' accepts a parameter 'axis' that can be an int or bool, and raises an error if 'axis' is not 0 or 1. No external data is read, no system commands executed, and no network activity. The variable names appear deliberately obfuscated but are not inherently malicious. The function performs a simple validation check without side effects or malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a simple validation function with obfuscated variable names. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code does not perform any harmful actions, data leakage, or backdoors.",
