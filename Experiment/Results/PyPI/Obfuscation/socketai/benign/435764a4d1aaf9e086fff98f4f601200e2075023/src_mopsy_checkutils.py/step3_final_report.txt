  "purpose": "Validation of 'axis' parameter to ensure it is either 0 or 1.",
  "sources": "Function parameter 'axis'. Constants 'jkanche', 'jkanche', and 'MIT' are defined but unused.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data flows or external data sinks; the code only raises an exception on invalid input.",
  "flows": "Input 'axis' flows into validation check; no other data flows or external interactions are present.",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated variable names; unused string constants that do not influence logic.",
  "analysis": "The code performs a simple validation of the 'axis' parameter, raising an error if invalid. The constants are unused and do not affect behavior. Obfuscated variable names suggest possible concealment but do not indicate malicious intent. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code are present. The validation logic is straightforward and benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is benign, serving as a simple input validator with obfuscated variable names. No malicious behavior, supply chain attack vectors, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The obfuscation appears superficial and does not imply malicious intent.",
