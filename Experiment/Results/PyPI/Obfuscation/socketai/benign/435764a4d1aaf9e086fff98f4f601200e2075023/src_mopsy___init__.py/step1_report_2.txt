{
  "purpose": "Conditional import of importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata based on Python version, followed by attempting to retrieve package metadata for the current module name and importing local helper modules.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, __name__, imported modules (__import__, importlib.metadata, importlib_metadata), local modules (.helpers, .adders)",
  "sinks": "None directly present; no untrusted data outputs or sensitive data leaks are observed",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → import statements; __name__ → sSMXFzuvpHHSfmNotfydkeKvSRpiXDzp invocation; exception handling flow if PackageNotFoundError is raised",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names, nonsensical import alias (sSMXFzuvpHHSfmNotfydkeKvSRpiXDzp), and indirect package metadata access with exception handling; no clear malicious intent but highly unusual coding style",
  "analysis": "The code performs a version check to decide whether to import 'importlib.metadata' or 'importlib_metadata'. It then attempts to call the imported function with the current module name to retrieve package metadata, handling exceptions if the package is not found. The use of obfuscated variable names and indirect referencing is suspicious but not inherently malicious. The final import statements are standard relative imports of local modules. There is no evidence of malicious behavior such as data exfiltration, system manipulation, or backdoors. The overall structure appears intentionally obfuscated, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent, but in isolation, it appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is obfuscated and uses unusual variable names, but it does not contain any clear malicious behavior or security risks. It seems to be a module for retrieving package info with obfuscation techniques, which could be suspicious but not malicious in itself.",
