  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing standard version-aware package info retrieval with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, but the heavy obfuscation warrants cautious review if part of a larger codebase. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high at 0.8, and the overall security risk is low at 0.2."
