{
  "purpose": "The code performs a Python version check to import either importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, then attempts to retrieve the current package/module name and associated package info using an obfuscated function. If the package is not found, it defaults to 'unknown'. It then deletes the imported symbols and imports local helper modules.",
  "sources": "The code reads the module name (__name__) and attempts to retrieve package metadata via the obfuscated function.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sinks are present; the code does not send data over network, write to files, or execute untrusted input.",
  "flows": "Source: __name__ variable; Function call to obfuscated function with module name; Sink: None, as no data is sent or written externally.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation of variable and function names, which could be used to conceal malicious intent; use of dynamic import based on Python version; local module imports at the end.",
  "analysis": "The code checks Python version to import the appropriate module for package metadata retrieval. It then attempts to obtain package info for the current module using an obfuscated function name, handling the case where the package is not found. The heavy obfuscation of identifiers raises suspicion but does not inherently indicate malicious behavior. The code performs standard package management tasks with no evident malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation could be for concealment or intellectual property reasons, but without further context, it remains suspicious. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are detected in this fragment.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears benign, performing standard version-aware package info retrieval with obfuscated identifiers. There is no evidence of malicious behavior, but the heavy obfuscation warrants cautious review if part of a larger codebase. The malware score is 0, the obfuscation score is high at 0.8, and the overall security risk is low at 0.2.",
