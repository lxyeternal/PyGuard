{
  "purpose": "The code aims to import specific modules based on Python version and retrieve package metadata for the current module, then import additional helper modules.",
  "sources": "sys.version_info, __name__, importlib.metadata or importlib_metadata, and the current module's name.",
  "sinks": "Potentially the variable that stores the package metadata result, which could be used elsewhere; import statements importing local modules.",
  "flows": "sys.version_info → conditional import of metadata modules → retrieval of package info using the module name → assignment to a variable; subsequent import of local modules.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated variable names (e.g., sSMXFzuvpHHSfmNotfydkeKvSRpiXDzp, wLiZJNMFTMAJmhZiVIqXdBKkykOiMtiw, ZvEAGQTwBYUvXDekxcNRyxjACkobJmNc) which serve no clear purpose and hinder readability; no clear reason for dynamic import handling based on Python version; no actual malicious behavior detected but code obfuscation is present.",
  "analysis": "The code performs conditional imports based on Python version, then attempts to retrieve package metadata for the current module using obfuscated variable names. It uses try-except-finally blocks, but the exception handling merely sets a default string. The import of helper modules at the end is standard. The obfuscation raises suspicion but no malicious actions are evident. The use of non-descriptive variable names may be an attempt to hide intent but does not directly indicate malicious behavior.",
  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated with meaningless variable names, which raises suspicion but does not contain clear malicious activity or security risks. It appears to be designed to make analysis difficult, possibly to hide malicious intent, but no explicit malicious actions are present in this fragment.",
