  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-check with the original code, and evaluate the scores and reasoning.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1**\n\n- **Summary:** Correctly identifies the purpose as version-dependent import, package name retrieval, error handling, and local module imports. Notes obfuscated variable names and potential concealment but finds no malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.2. These seem reasonable given the obfuscation but no evidence of malicious behavior.\n- **Assessment:** The reasoning is sound. The obfuscation is suspicious but not malicious. The low security risk score aligns with the benign analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to Report 1, emphasizing the obfuscation and version-aware import, with no malicious intent evident.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** Correct. The code is suspiciously obfuscated but lacks concrete malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3**\n\n- **Summary:** Focuses on the function call `sSMXFzuvpHHSfmNotfydkeKvSRpiXDzp`, which appears to be obfuscated. Recognizes the potential for malicious intent but finds no evidence.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.2. Justified.\n- **Assessment:** The analysis is consistent. The obfuscation could be hiding malicious code, but with the given info, it’s not confirmed.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4**\n\n- **Summary:** Highlights the heavy obfuscation, version-dependent imports, and no clear malicious activity.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.2. Appropriate.\n- **Assessment:** The suspicion is valid, but no evidence supports malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5**\n\n- **Summary:** Similar to others, emphasizing benign behavior, standard package metadata retrieval, and obfuscation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0.8, Risk = 0.2. Justified.\n- **Assessment:** Consistent and reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Evaluation:\n\n- **Malware Score:** All reports assign 0, which aligns with the analysis—no evidence of malicious activity such as code injection, data exfiltration, or system manipulation.\n- **Obfuscated Score:** 0.8 across reports is justified given the heavily obfuscated variable names and indirect import handling.\n- **Risk Score:** 0.2 is reasonable; the obfuscation raises suspicion but does not indicate active risk.\n\n### Additional considerations:\n\n- The function name `sSMXFzuvpHHSfmNotfydkeKvSRpiXDzp` is suspiciously nonsensical, likely obfuscated.\n- The code's logic itself is benign—version-aware import, package name retrieval, error handling, and local module imports are standard patterns.\n- The obfuscation could be an attempt to hide malicious code, but no such code is evident in this fragment.\n\n---\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** Remain at **0**.\n- **Obfuscated score:** Keep at **0.8** due to the heavy obfuscation.\n- **Risk score:** Maintain at **0.2**, as the code appears benign but warrants caution due to obfuscation.\n\n**In conclusion,** the code appears to be a benign, version-aware import and metadata retrieval snippet with heavily obfuscated identifiers. No malicious activity is evident, but the obfuscation should be monitored in the context of the entire project.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Final Score |\n|----------------|--------------|\n| Malware        | 0            |\n| Obfuscated     | 0.8          |\n| Security Risk  | 0.2          |\n\nPlease note that continued monitoring and analysis of the full codebase are recommended, especially to verify the contents of imported helper modules and the actual behavior of the obfuscated functions.",
