  "conclusion": "The code is a matrix iteration utility with high obfuscation but no evident malicious activity. The suspicion stems from obfuscation and reliance on an unknown external method. The malware score should remain low, but the obfuscation score is justified high. Overall security risk is low, pending further investigation of the external method."
