  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard tryton module registration script with heavy obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware risk remains low. Further review of the broader context is recommended, but based on this snippet alone, the supply chain risk is minimal."
