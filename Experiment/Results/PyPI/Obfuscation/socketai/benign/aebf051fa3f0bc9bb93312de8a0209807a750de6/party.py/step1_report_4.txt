{
  "purpose": "The code defines classes and methods for handling party and sale shipment cost methods within a Tryton-based application, including dynamic field selection and copying functionality.",
  "sources": "Reads data from the database via Pool().get() calls, especially in the method CLwQKpVKJLJiPlYhqHokJCXnJEIQGqUI and jXZxlqKeNMqsOJTLslazgkWJWeHVvHvY, and accesses class attributes.",
  "sinks": "Potentially in the methods that perform database retrievals and class attribute access, but no direct untrusted data sinks such as network transmission, file writes, or eval statements are present.",
  "flows": "Data flows from database retrievals in Pool().get() through method calls that retrieve selection options; no indication of flow from untrusted input to sensitive operations.",
  "anomalies": "The code contains heavily obfuscated function and variable names, which could be an attempt to hide malicious intent. The function eAUHGGWlrjXikKQEkCkxLyfZmjwfGEIA dynamically retrieves field options and appends a default choice, which is typical but combined with obfuscation raises suspicion.",
  "analysis": "The code primarily defines classes for party and sale methods with selection fields that retrieve options dynamically from the database via Pool().get() calls. The obfuscated function eAUHGGWlrjXikKQEkCkxLyfZmjwfGEIA accesses field options for a given field name and adds a default option, which is not inherently malicious but suspicious due to obfuscation. Class methods perform standard copy operations and dynamic attribute retrieval. No evidence of malicious data transmission, code injection, or backdoors. The obfuscation and opaque naming conventions are the primary anomalies. The code does not perform any suspicious network activity, file access, or data exfiltration.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be part of a standard Tryton module with heavily obfuscated naming, possibly to hinder analysis. No direct malicious behavior or malware is evident. The obfuscation alone is suspicious but not conclusive of malicious intent. Overall, the code poses a low security risk but warrants cautious review due to obfuscation.",
