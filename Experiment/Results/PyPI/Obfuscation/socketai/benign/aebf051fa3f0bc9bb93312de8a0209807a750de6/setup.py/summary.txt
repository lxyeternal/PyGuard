  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup with obfuscation that could be used to conceal details but does not show evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The low malware score (0) aligns with the absence of active malicious actions. The high obfuscation score (~0.7) reflects the obfuscated code style. The overall security risk remains low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation and hardcoded secrets, which warrant cautious review but are not inherently malicious."
