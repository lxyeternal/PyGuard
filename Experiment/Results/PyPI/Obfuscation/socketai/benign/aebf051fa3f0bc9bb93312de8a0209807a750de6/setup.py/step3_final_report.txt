  "purpose": "Package setup script for a Tryton module, configuring dependencies and metadata.",
  "sources": "Reads 'tryton.cfg' file, processes dependency lists, and constructs package metadata.",
  "sinks": "No untrusted data sources, network activity, or data exfiltration observed.",
  "flows": "Configuration data flows from files into dependency lists and package setup parameters; no external or untrusted data flows detected.",
  "anomalies": "Presence of obfuscated variable names, a hardcoded string 'dnykjaqq2wgipk85', and obfuscated functions; use of encoded strings and conditional URL construction based on version parity.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard setup script with obfuscation and hardcoded secrets, likely used for concealment. No network activity, data leaks, or malicious code detected. The obfuscation and secret string are suspicious but do not demonstrate malicious intent. Dependency processing appears normal, and no external communications or code injections are present.",
  "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup with obfuscation that could be used to conceal details but does not show evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The low malware score (0) aligns with the absence of active malicious actions. The high obfuscation score (~0.7) reflects the obfuscated code style. The overall security risk remains low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation and hardcoded secrets, which warrant cautious review but are not inherently malicious.",
