  "conclusion": "The code is heavily obfuscated and complex, which warrants caution. However, there is no concrete evidence of malicious payloads or activity. The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score remains low. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to the potential for concealment. Continuous monitoring and deeper dynamic analysis are recommended to confirm the absence of malicious behavior."
