{
  "purpose": "Unit test for sale shipment cost module, testing grouping fields in sale and stock shipment models.",
  "sources": "Reading modules from trytond.pool and trytond.tests; retrieving models 'sale.sale' and 'stock.shipment.out' from the pool.",
  "sinks": "Calling methods on mocked objects; no data sinks, external communications, or sensitive data handling observed.",
  "flows": "Retrieving models from pool -> creating mock objects -> invoking method 'fpccgrwkAHTfcAHxEVXMIaxrvMWSYKFW' on shipment record -> asserting on returned set.",
  "anomalies": "Use of obfuscated method name 'fpccgrwkAHTfcAHxEVXMIaxrvMWSYKFW'; no hardcoded credentials or secrets; test code appears intentionally obscured but not malicious.",
  "analysis": "The code is a unit test that sets up models from the trytond framework, mocks a method call, and performs assertions. The method names and variable names are intentionally obscure, which may be for obfuscation or code complexity. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network activity, data exfiltration, or backdoors. Use of 'MagicMock' and standard testing patterns suggests typical test setup. No sensitive data handling or external communication is evident. The obfuscation may be a concern but does not indicate malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, albeit obfuscated, unit test with no evidence of malicious intent or malware. The obfuscation appears intentional but not malicious. No security risks or malware detected.",
