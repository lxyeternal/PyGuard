  "purpose": "Unit test for 'sale_shipment_cost' module, testing grouping of shipment fields using Tryton models and mocks.",
  "sources": "Retrieves models 'sale.sale' and 'stock.shipment.out' from the pool; uses MagicMock to simulate method behavior.",
  "sinks": "No external data sinks or untrusted data flows; test assertions check for expected set contents.",
  "flows": "Model retrieval -> method call with mock object -> assertion on returned set.",
  "anomalies": "Highly obfuscated method name 'fpccgrwkAHTfcAHxEVXMIaxrvMWSYKFW'; variable and method names are non-descriptive.",
  "analysis": "The code is a standard unit test employing model retrieval and mocking. The obfuscated method name is suspicious but not inherently malicious, likely an artifact of code obfuscation or code generation. No external network activity, data exfiltration, or malicious behavior is detected. The high obfuscation score (0.7) reflects the unusual naming, but the malware score remains at 0, indicating no malicious intent. The low security risk score (0.2) is appropriate given the benign nature of the code. Confidence in this assessment is high (0.8).",
  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate, obfuscated unit test with no evidence of malicious activity. The obfuscation warrants further review if unexpected, but currently, it does not indicate security threats.",
