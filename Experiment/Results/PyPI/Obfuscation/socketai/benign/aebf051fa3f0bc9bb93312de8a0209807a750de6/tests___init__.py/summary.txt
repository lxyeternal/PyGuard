  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting cautious handling. No definitive malicious payloads are identified, but the potential for malicious activity exists if eval/exec are misused. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score around 0.2-0.3 and obfuscation around 0.3. The scores across reports are justified and align with the observed code characteristics."
