  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency for malicious behavior, code obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Input functions, environment variables, external files, network sources, data flows from sources to sinks such as network sockets, file writes, system commands.",
  "sinks": "Network sockets, file writes, system commands, unvalidated data flows from sources.",
  "flows": "Data from sources (inputs, environment variables) to sinks (network, file, system commands), often unvalidated or dynamically executed.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, dynamic code execution, obfuscated variable names, redundant or complex expressions, hardcoded credentials/URLs, disorganized structure, redundant functions, misleading variable names.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits signs of dynamic code execution via eval/exec, which raises suspicion of malicious intent. Obfuscation indicators include complex expressions and misleading variable names. Data flows from untrusted sources to sinks such as network or file operations, sometimes unvalidated. Some reports note obfuscation levels around 0.3-0.4, aligning with moderate suspicion. No explicit malicious payloads or backdoors are confirmed. Several reports lack code or provide benign code, with low malware scores (0-0.2). Overall, the presence of eval/exec and obfuscation justifies a moderate security risk score, especially in Report 1. The assessments are consistent with the evidence, with scores appropriately reflecting suspicion levels.",
  "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting cautious handling. No definitive malicious payloads are identified, but the potential for malicious activity exists if eval/exec are misused. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score around 0.2-0.3 and obfuscation around 0.3. The scores across reports are justified and align with the observed code characteristics.",
