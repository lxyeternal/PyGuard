      "conclusion": "The script is a typical package setup with obfuscation that could be used to conceal details but does not show evidence of malicious behavior or supply chain compromise. The low malware score (0) aligns with the absence of active malicious actions. The high obfuscation score (~0.7) reflects the obfuscated code style. The overall security risk remains low (~0.2), primarily due to obfuscation and hardcoded secrets, which warrant cautious review but are not inherently malicious."

      "conclusion": "The code appears to be a standard tryton module registration script with heavy obfuscation. There is no direct evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The high obfuscation score is justified, but malware risk remains low. Further review of the broader context is recommended, but based on this snippet alone, the supply chain risk is minimal."

The obfuscation is likely for concealment or code protection, not malicious sabotage. The security risk is low, and malware likelihood is negligible."

The high obfuscation score is justified, and the malware score remains low. The overall security risk is moderate, primarily due to the potential for concealment. Continuous monitoring and deeper dynamic analysis are recommended to confirm the absence of malicious behavior."

The high obfuscation warrants caution and further review if source trustworthiness is uncertain, but based on the provided code, the overall security risk is low."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard configuration script with obfuscated variable names, no evidence of malware or malicious activity. The main security consideration is external configuration manipulation, which is common in such scripts. The current malware score is appropriate at 0, and the obfuscation level is high but not malicious. The overall security risk remains low, around 0.2-0.3, primarily due to external dependencies rather than code behavior."

      "conclusion": "The dependency shows moderate signs of obfuscation and dynamic code execution, warranting cautious handling. No definitive malicious payloads are identified, but the potential for malicious activity exists if eval/exec are misused. The overall security risk is moderate, with a malware score around 0.2-0.3 and obfuscation around 0.3. The scores across reports are justified and align with the observed code characteristics."
