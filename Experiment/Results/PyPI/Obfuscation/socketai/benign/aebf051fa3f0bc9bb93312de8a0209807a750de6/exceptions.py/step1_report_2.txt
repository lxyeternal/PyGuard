  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class inheriting from UserError in trytond.exceptions module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from trytond.exceptions; class declaration with no data input or processing.",
  "sinks": "No sinks or data processing points present.",
  "flows": "No data flow or untrusted data handling; only class definition without runtime execution or data manipulation.",
  "anomalies": "The class name 'YBcjngmBYyKFzBPacKngjQaEcLMiWFjo' appears to be a random, non-descriptive string, which is suspicious and may suggest obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a standard exception class from a well-known library and defines a new exception class with a nonsensical name. No data is read or written, and there are no apparent malicious behaviors or code injections. The unusual class name is suspicious and could be used to hide malicious intent or obfuscate code functionality.",
  "conclusion": "The code itself is minimal and harmless in functionality, but the nonsensical class name is suspicious and could indicate obfuscation or malicious intent. No active malicious behavior is evident from this snippet alone.",
