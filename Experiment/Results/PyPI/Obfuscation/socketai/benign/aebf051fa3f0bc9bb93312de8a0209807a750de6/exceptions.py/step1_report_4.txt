  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class inheriting from UserError in the trytond.exceptions module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from trytond.exceptions and class definition that inherits from UserError.",
  "sinks": "No direct untrusted data sinks or data leak points are present in this code.",
  "flows": "No data flow from sources to sinks; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be a nonsensical string, possibly obfuscated or generated; no other anomalies observed.",
  "analysis": "The code imports a specific exception class and defines a subclass with a highly unusual, nonsensical name. There is no code execution, data handling, or external communication. The class is simply a placeholder or custom exception with an obfuscated name, which by itself does not indicate malicious intent. No hardcoded credentials, suspicious code, or malicious patterns are present.",
  "conclusion": "This code merely defines a custom exception class with an obfuscated name. There are no malicious behaviors or security risks evident. The obfuscated class name could be for concealment but does not in itself indicate malicious intent.",
