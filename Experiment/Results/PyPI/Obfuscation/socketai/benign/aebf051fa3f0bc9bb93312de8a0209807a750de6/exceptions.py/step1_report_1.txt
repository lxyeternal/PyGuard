  "sinks": "No data sinks or untrusted data processing observed",
  "flows": "No data flow from source to sink; the code only defines a class",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be obfuscated or randomly generated; no meaningful naming",
  "analysis": "The code imports UserError from trytond.exceptions and defines a new class with a seemingly random name that inherits from UserError. The class contains no additional logic, methods, or attributes. The unusual class name suggests possible obfuscation or malicious intent, but there is no active malicious code or behavior present. The import statement is legitimate for trytond modules, but the class name raises suspicion due to lack of clarity or purpose.",
  "conclusion": "The code only defines an obfuscated class inheriting from a legitimate exception class without any operational logic. No malicious behavior or security risks are directly evident, but the nonsensical class name could indicate obfuscation or potential malicious intent if part of a larger suspicious codebase.",
