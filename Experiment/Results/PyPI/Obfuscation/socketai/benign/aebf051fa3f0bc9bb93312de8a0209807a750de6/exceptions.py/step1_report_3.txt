  "purpose": "Define a custom exception class inheriting from UserError in the trytond.exceptions module.",
  "sources": "Import statement from trytond.exceptions and class definition.",
  "sinks": "No sinks present; no data processing or untrusted data handling.",
  "flows": "No data flows; the code only defines a class.",
  "anomalies": "Class name appears to be an obfuscated or randomly generated string, which may suggest obfuscation or concealment. No other anomalies detected.",
  "analysis": "The code imports UserError from trytond.exceptions, then defines a subclass with an unusual, non-descriptive name. The class contains no methods or attributes. The naming pattern and minimal content raise suspicion of obfuscation or an attempt to hide malicious intent. However, based solely on this snippet, there is no active malicious behavior or data flow.",
  "conclusion": "The code appears to be a straightforward class definition with obfuscated naming. No malicious actions are evident from this snippet, but the obfuscated class name warrants cautious review if part of a larger codebase.",
