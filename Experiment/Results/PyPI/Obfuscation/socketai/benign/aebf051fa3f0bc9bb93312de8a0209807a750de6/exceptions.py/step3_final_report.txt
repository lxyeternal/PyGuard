{
  "purpose": "Defines a custom exception class inheriting from UserError with an obfuscated, nonsensical name.",
  "sources": "Import of UserError from trytond.exceptions",
  "sinks": "None",
  "flows": "None",
  "anomalies": "Obfuscated class name; no methods or data processing; minimal code",
  "analysis": "The code imports a legitimate exception class and defines a subclass with a highly obfuscated name. No data flows, sinks, or malicious behaviors are present. The class is syntactically correct but the nonsensical naming raises suspicion of obfuscation. No evidence of malicious activity or security vulnerabilities is found in this snippet. The obfuscated name suggests potential concealment, but without further context, the code appears benign.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a minimal, syntactically correct exception class with obfuscated naming. No malicious behavior is evident. The obfuscation warrants caution, but the code itself does not pose a security threat.",
