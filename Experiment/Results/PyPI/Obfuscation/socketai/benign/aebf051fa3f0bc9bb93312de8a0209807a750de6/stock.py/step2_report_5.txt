  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, verify the logical consistency, and assess the scores.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Describes extension/customization of shipment and cost sale logic in Tryton. Data sources include database fields, user inputs, and context, which aligns with the code.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Database updates, currency computations, and state transitions are typical. Data flows from inputs to computations and then to database updates.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated class and variable names, use of NotImplementedError, and placeholder methods suggest incomplete or intentionally obscured code, but no malicious activities like network calls or data exfiltration are visible.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The analysis reasonably concludes that the code is a heavily obfuscated ERP customization with no evident malicious intent. The confidence level (0.8) seems appropriate given the obfuscation but no malicious indicators.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (consistent)  \n- Obfuscated: 0.7 (high, justified by the obfuscation)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low, typical application logic)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores seem reasonable.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar ERP extension, involving sale, currency, invoice lines, and context.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Currency conversions, data updates, and workflow transitions are standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** No hardcoded secrets, backdoors, or network activity. Obfuscated class names and placeholder methods are present but typical for incomplete code.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious behavior, just obfuscation and incomplete code. Confidence is high (0.8), which is appropriate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0.6 (justified)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores align well with the analysis.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Extends shipment and sale models, with currency and state management.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Currency computations, data updates, state transitions—standard ERP logic.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated class/method names, use of set_context for currency calculations, and NotImplementedError placeholders. No network or external activity.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity detected. Obfuscation is notable but not necessarily malicious. Confidence is high (0.9).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0.6 (justified)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Similar ERP extension with custom fields and workflows.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Currency computations, workflow state changes, data updates—standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated names, use of set_context, and placeholders. No network activity or backdoors.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** No malicious activity, obfuscation likely for concealment. Confidence at 0.8 seems appropriate.\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0 (appropriate)  \n- Obfuscated: 0.7 (justified)  \n- Risk: 0.2 (low)\n\n**Verdict:** Consistent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Purpose & Data Sources:** Focused on shipment cost sale management, currency, and sale prices.\n- **Sinks & Flows:** Currency conversions, data updates, state transitions—standard.\n- **Anomalies & Analysis:** Obfuscated class/method names, use of set_context, and some functions raising NotImplementedError, indicating incomplete code. No network activity or external data leaks.\n- **Conclusion & Confidence:** The obfuscation and incomplete methods are suspicious but not necessarily malicious. The analysis notes the potential for concealment but finds no direct malicious activity. Confidence is moderate (0.6).\n\n**Scores:**  \n- Malware: 0.2 (moderate, justified by obfuscation)  \n- Obfuscated: 0.7 (high, justified)  \n- Risk: 0.3 (moderate, due to incomplete code and obfuscation)\n\n**Verdict:** Scores are reasonable.\n\n---\n\n### **Overall assessment:**\n\n- **Malware scores** across all reports are consistently low (0 or 0.2), aligning with the absence of malicious indicators.\n- **Obfuscated scores** are high (0.6–0.7), justified by the heavily obfuscated class and method names, which may be an attempt to conceal intent or simply code generation.\n- **Risk scores** are low (0.2–0.3), consistent with the analysis that these are ERP customizations with no evident malicious behavior.\n\n---\n\n### **My own estimate:**\n\n- **Malware:** 0.1 — The code appears to be standard ERP extension with obfuscation, no signs of malicious payloads.\n- **Obfuscated:** 0.65 — The obfuscation is significant, but it may be intentional for code concealment or obfuscation tools.\n- **Risk:** 0.2 — Low, as no malicious activity is detected, only incomplete/obfuscated code.\n\n---\n\n**Final notes:**  \nThe scores in the reports are generally reasonable and aligned with the detailed reasoning. The high obfuscation scores are justified, but the malware scores remain low, indicating no evidence of malicious intent. The overall security risk remains low, with the primary concern being code obfuscation and incomplete implementation, not malicious activity.",
