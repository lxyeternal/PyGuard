  "purpose": "Utility for managing package versioning, environment variables, and package info, with obfuscation.",
  "sources": "Reads environment variables ('VERSION'), accesses installed packages via pkg_resources, checks for 'nvidia-smi', and constructs version strings.",
  "sinks": "No sinks indicating data leaks or malicious actions; code does not perform network communication or system modifications.",
  "flows": "Source: environment variables and package data -> processing functions -> version string construction.",
  "anomalies": "Heavy obfuscation with nonsensical variable names, use of internal pip modules, references to undefined variables ('date_version', 'version'), potential bugs or obfuscation techniques.",
  "analysis": "The code is heavily obfuscated, importing internal pip modules, and references variables that are not defined within the snippet, indicating either obfuscation or errors. It interacts with environment variables and package metadata but does not perform any malicious actions such as network communication, data exfiltration, or system modification. The obfuscation and undefined variables raise suspicion but do not constitute malicious intent. The code appears to serve as a version management utility, albeit with obfuscation that could be used to hide malicious behavior. No evidence of malicious payloads or sabotage is present.",
  "conclusion": "The code is primarily a benign version management utility with heavy obfuscation. There is no evidence of malicious activity or sabotage. The high obfuscation warrants caution, but overall, the code does not pose a security threat.",
