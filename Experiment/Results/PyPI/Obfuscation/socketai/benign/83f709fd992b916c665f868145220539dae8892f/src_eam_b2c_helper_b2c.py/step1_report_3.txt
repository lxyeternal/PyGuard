  "purpose": "Provide functions and classes to manage Azure AD B2C users via Microsoft Graph API, including creation, update, retrieval, and deletion.",
  "sources": "User input data from function parameters and request responses from API calls.",
  "sinks": "Requests to Microsoft Graph API endpoints for user management, JSON responses, and potential data leaks.",
  "flows": "User details from input -> build user objects -> send API requests -> receive responses; token retrieval -> API request headers -> user data processing.",
  "anomalies": "Hardcoded passwords in build_local_user_object ('eightamAdmin!23', 'eightam!23'); no apparent secure handling of credentials; printing branch_id info; no input validation or sanitization; potential exposure of sensitive info via logs or responses.",
  "analysis": "The code constructs user objects for Azure AD B2C with some hardcoded passwords, which could be considered insecure. The token fetching method directly returns the 'access_token' without additional validation, but this is standard. The use of 'print' statements for branch ID could leak information in logs. The API calls handle user data but do not perform explicit validation or sanitization on inputs, which might pose risks if inputs are malicious. No evident malware behavior such as data exfiltration, remote command execution, or backdoors is present. The code mainly interfaces with Microsoft Graph API and handles user data in expected ways, apart from insecure credential hardcoding and minimal input validation. Overall, there is a low likelihood of malicious intent but some security concerns about hardcoded credentials and logging.",
  "conclusion": "The code provides standard user management functions for Azure AD B2C with some insecure practices like hardcoded passwords and logging sensitive information. No signs of malicious behavior or malware are evident. The security risk is moderate due to credential management practices but does not indicate active malicious intent.",
