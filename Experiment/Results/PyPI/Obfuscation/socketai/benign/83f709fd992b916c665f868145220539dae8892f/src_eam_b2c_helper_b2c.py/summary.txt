  "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate user management utility with security hygiene issues like hardcoded passwords and minimal input validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The overall security risk is moderate due to insecure practices but not malicious intent. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score of approximately 0.3-0.4 reflects the insecure practices identified."
