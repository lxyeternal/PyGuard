  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully and then synthesize an overall assessment.\n\n---\n\n**Report 1:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** The code logic is consistent with user management via Microsoft Graph API. No malicious code detected.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Hardcoded passwords ('eightamAdmin!23' and 'eightam!23') are insecure. Email modification with branch_id appending is potentially risky if inputs are malicious, but no sanitization is performed.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3. These seem reasonable given the insecure password practice but no malicious activity.\n- **Justification for risk score:** The static passwords and minimal input validation pose security risks but do not constitute active malicious behavior.\n- **Additional notes:** No signs of malware, backdoors, or malicious exfiltration. The code appears to be a legitimate utility with insecure practices.\n\n---\n\n**Report 2:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Similar to Report 1, with the same insecure hardcoded passwords and email concatenation.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Same as above—hardcoded passwords, minimal validation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3. These are consistent.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, just insecure credential handling.\n- **Additional notes:** No malware, no backdoors, just security hygiene issues.\n\n---\n\n**Report 3:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Same pattern—hardcoded passwords, logging branch_id info, no validation.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Same concerns about static passwords and email concatenation.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.4. Slightly higher due to logging of branch_id, which could leak info.\n- **Justification:** No malicious activity, but logging sensitive info is a security concern.\n- **Additional notes:** No malware, no malicious intent.\n\n---\n\n**Report 4:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Same as above—hardcoded passwords, insecure practices.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Same issues.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3. Appropriate.\n- **Justification:** No malware, just insecure credential practices.\n- **Additional notes:** No malicious activity.\n\n---\n\n**Report 5:**\n\n- **Presence of issues:** Same pattern—hardcoded passwords, no malicious behavior.\n- **Errors/Flaws:** Same concerns.\n- **Scores:** Malware = 0, Obfuscated = 0, Risk = 0.3. Reasonable.\n- **Justification:** No malware or malicious intent detected.\n\n---\n\n### Overall Assessment:\n\n- **Malware score:** All reports consistently indicate no malware (0). The code is a legitimate user management utility.\n- **Obfuscated score:** 0 across all reports; no obfuscation detected.\n- **Risk score:** Ranges from 0.3 to 0.4, primarily due to insecure practices like hardcoded passwords and minimal input validation, which are security hygiene issues rather than malicious behaviors.\n\n### Final Recommendations:\n\n- **Malware score:** **0** — no malicious activity detected.\n- **Obfuscated score:** **0** — code is straightforward.\n- **Risk score:** **0.3** — moderate security risk due to insecure password handling and lack of input validation.\n\n**Note:** The static passwords are a security concern but do not indicate malicious intent. They should be replaced with secure, dynamically managed secrets.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\n| Score Type     | Estimated Value |\n|----------------|-----------------|\n| Malware        | 0               |\n| Obfuscated     | 0               |\n| Security Risk  | 0.3             |\n\nThis aligns with the analysis that the code is primarily legitimate, with some insecure practices that should be addressed but do not constitute malicious activity.",
