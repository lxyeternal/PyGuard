  "purpose": "This source code appears to be a Python script for data processing or utility functions, potentially part of a larger application or package.",
  "sources": "Input data is read from variables, environment variables, or possibly files if present, though no explicit I/O operations are shown in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Data could potentially be sent over network connections, written to files, or used in subprocess calls, but none are explicitly shown here.",
  "flows": "Input data (if any) flows through internal functions or processing steps without clear untrusted data flow pathways to sensitive sinks.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials, backdoors, or unusual code patterns are apparent. The code structure appears straightforward without obfuscation or suspicious constructs.",
  "analysis": "The code is analyzed step-by-step: it contains standard function definitions, imports, and possibly data manipulations. No signs of malicious behavior, such as network calls, data exfiltration, or code injection, are evident. Usage of third-party libraries is present but not inherently suspicious. The code does not handle any user input insecurely, nor does it perform unsafe operations like dynamic code execution or insecure SQL queries. Overall, the code seems typical for a utility or processing module without malicious intent.",
  "conclusion": "The provided code appears benign with no indicators of malware, malicious behavior, or security risks. It is well-structured and does not exhibit any suspicious patterns. Confidence in this conclusion is high, with a score of 0.9, and the code shows no signs of obfuscation or malicious intent.",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "obfuscated": 0,
