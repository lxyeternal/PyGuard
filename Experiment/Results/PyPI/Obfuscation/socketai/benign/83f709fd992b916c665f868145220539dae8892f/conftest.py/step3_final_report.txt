  "purpose": "Evaluate supply chain security of the open source dependency by analyzing code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Code inputs, external data fetches, environment variables, suspicious function calls (eval, exec), hardcoded strings, network connections.",
  "sinks": "Data exfiltration points, network transmissions, file modifications, environment variable access.",
  "flows": "Sources leading to sinks via function calls, data handling, or control flow manipulations.",
  "anomalies": "Use of eval/exec, obfuscation signs, hardcoded suspicious strings, complex control flows, suspicious URLs/IPs.",
  "analysis": "The code appears benign in most reports, with scores reflecting no malicious activity. Report 4 shows signs of obfuscation and suspicious functions, warranting a higher malware score. Slightly increasing malware score from 0.4 to 0.5 for Report 4 aligns better with the indicators. Obfuscation score of 0.6 is justified by the described traits. Security risk score of 0.65 appropriately reflects potential threat levels. Other reports are consistent with their benign descriptions.",
  "conclusion": "Most code snippets are benign; Report 4 warrants cautious suspicion. Slightly increasing malware score for Report 4 to 0.5 improves risk assessment accuracy. Overall, the scores are consistent with the analysis, with minor adjustments recommended for Report 4.",
