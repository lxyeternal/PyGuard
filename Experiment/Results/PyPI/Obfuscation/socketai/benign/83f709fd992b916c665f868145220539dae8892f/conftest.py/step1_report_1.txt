{
  "purpose": "The code appears to be a basic script for data processing or utility functions, but without additional context, its exact purpose is unclear.",
  "sources": "Input data sources are not explicitly shown; the code does not explicitly read from external inputs such as files, network, or environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential sinks are not clearly identifiable; the code does not demonstrate actions that send data over the network, write to files, or execute system commands.",
  "flows": "No explicit data flow from untrusted sources to sensitive sinks is apparent; the code mainly performs internal calculations or transformations.",
  "anomalies": "No obvious anomalies such as hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, or unusual language features are present. The code structure appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "The code is simple and lacks complex or suspicious constructs. There are no signs of malicious behavior such as network communication, file manipulation, or credential handling. The absence of external input sources and sinks suggests low risk. Since the code provided is minimal and straightforward, it does not contain any obvious indicators of malware or security issues.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign, with no suspicious or malicious constructs detected.",
