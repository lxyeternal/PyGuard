  "purpose": "The purpose of this source code appears to be to perform some form of data processing or utility function, though the specific intent is unclear due to lack of context.",
  "sources": "Potential data sources include environment variables, user input, or external files (if present in the unseen code), but none are explicitly visible in the provided snippet.",
  "sinks": "Possible sinks include network connections, file writing, or sensitive data transmission, but no specific sink functions are explicitly identified in the provided code.",
  "flows": "Without detailed code, it is difficult to definitively identify source-to-sink flows. No evidence of untrusted data flowing into potentially dangerous functions is observable in the provided snippet.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code structures, hardcoded secrets, or obfuscated elements are visible in the provided code. The code appears straightforward and standard.",
  "analysis": "A thorough review of the code did not reveal any suspicious behaviors, such as malicious data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious logic. The code uses typical Python constructs and does not invoke external or network functions. There are no signs of obfuscation or malicious payloads. Due to the lack of specific data sources, sinks, or network activity in the snippet, no malicious activity can be inferred.",
  "conclusion": "Based on the provided code snippet, there is no evidence of malicious behavior or security risks. The code appears benign with no suspicious anomalies or malicious intent identified.",
