  "review": "Let's analyze each report carefully, cross-referencing with the code and considering the scoring rationale.\n\n**Overall observations:**\n- All reports describe the code as a test suite for the B2CHelper class, using mocks to simulate API interactions.\n- The mock functions return static, benign data, with no signs of malicious payloads, obfuscation, or suspicious behavior.\n- The token and secret data are mock/test data, not real secrets.\n- No evidence of code that could lead to data exfiltration, backdoors, or malicious exploits.\n- The code is standard for unit testing with mocks, and the responses are safe.\n\n---\n\n### Detailed review:\n\n**Malware Score:**\n- All reports assign a malware score of 0, citing no malicious behavior, payloads, or suspicious code.\n- The code only performs mock API calls, returning static data.\n- No signs of obfuscated code, hidden payloads, or malicious intent.\n- **Conclusion:** Malware score should remain at 0.\n\n**Obfuscated Score:**\n- All reports assign an obfuscated score of 0.\n- The code is straightforward, with clear mock functions and test data.\n- No signs of code obfuscation or hidden logic.\n- **Conclusion:** Obfuscated score should remain at 0.\n\n**Risk Score:**\n- Most reports assign a very low risk score (around 0.1 to 0.2), citing the code's purpose as testing with mock data and no real operations.\n- One report (Report 1) assigns 0.1, others are at 0.1 or 0.2.\n- Given the nature of the code—strictly testing, with no real data processing or network activity outside mocks—the risk is minimal.\n- **Justification for slightly higher scores (e.g., 0.2):** if considering the potential misuse outside a testing environment, but since the code is clearly for testing only, a risk score of 0.1 is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n### Final assessment:\n\n| Score Type       | Recommended Value | Justification                                                                                   |\n|------------------|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Malware          | **0**             | No malicious payloads, backdoors, or suspicious behavior.                                   |\n| Obfuscated       | **0**             | Clear, straightforward test code with no obfuscation.                                         |\n| Security Risk    | **0.1**           | Very low risk; only mock data and no real operations or data leaks.                         |\n\n**Additional notes:**\n- The reports are consistent in their assessment, emphasizing the safe, mock-based nature of the code.\n- No changes needed to the scores; they align well with the code's behavior.\n\n---\n\n### Final conclusion:\nThe code is a standard, safe unit test suite employing mocks for API interaction validation. It poses no supply chain or malware threat.\n\n**Estimated scores:**\n- **Malware:** 0\n- **Obfuscated:** 0\n- **Risk:** 0.1\n\nThis aligns with the reports' findings and the code's actual behavior.",
