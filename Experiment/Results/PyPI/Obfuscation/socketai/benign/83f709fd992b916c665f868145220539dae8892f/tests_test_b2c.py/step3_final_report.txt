{
  "purpose": "The code is a unit test suite for the B2CHelper class, employing mock functions to simulate API interactions with Microsoft Graph endpoints for user management tasks.",
  "sources": "The mock functions simulate data retrieval from API endpoints such as token requests, user data fetches, and user modifications.",
  "sinks": "There are no sinks that process untrusted data leading to data leaks or system effects; all data is static mock data used solely within tests.",
  "flows": "The data flows from the mocked request functions returning static responses to the test assertions verifying method outputs; no real data or external interactions occur.",
  "anomalies": "No anomalies or unusual code patterns are present; the code is straightforward, with clear mock responses and test logic.",
  "analysis": "The code consists of mock functions for HTTP methods, returning static, benign data to test the B2CHelper class methods. All secrets and tokens are mock data, with no real network or system modifications. The tests validate expected behaviors without executing malicious or obfuscated code. The mock responses are comprehensive and cover various API endpoints, ensuring thorough testing. No signs of malicious intent, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities are evident. The scores assigned in the reports (malware=0, obfuscated=0, risk≈0.1) are consistent with the code's nature as a safe, mock-based test suite.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured unit test suite that employs mocks for safe API interaction testing. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects the controlled testing environment. Overall, the code poses no supply chain or security threat.",
