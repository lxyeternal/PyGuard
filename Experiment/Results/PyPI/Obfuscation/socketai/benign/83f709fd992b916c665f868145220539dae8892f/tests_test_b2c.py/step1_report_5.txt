{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the B2CHelper class methods, mocking Microsoft Graph API interactions to verify functionality.",
  "sources": "Input data in mock functions, environment variables (if any in actual implementation, not visible here), and hardcoded token/request data.",
  "sinks": "API call functions (requests.post, requests.get, requests.patch, requests.delete), which interact with external services.",
  "flows": "Mocked input data flows into API call functions; responses are simulated for testing the class methods.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code patterns, hardcoded credentials appear only in the TOKEN_REQUEST_DATA, which is test setup data; no secrets embedded in the logic.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the B2CHelper class, utilizing mock responses to simulate interactions with external APIs. All data used in tests are static, with no dynamic or untrusted inputs present. The mock functions return predefined responses, and there are no indications of code that performs malicious actions such as data exfiltration, system modification, or network communication outside the test context. The token and secret values are hardcoded as test data and are not malicious. The tests do not execute any dangerous code or external commands. The structure and use of mocks suggest safe testing practices, with no signs of obfuscation, malicious payloads, or exploits.",
  "conclusion": "The code is a safe, well-structured unit test suite with no malicious intent or security risks. It only mocks external API interactions for testing the B2CHelper class, with no indication of malicious behavior or security vulnerabilities.",
