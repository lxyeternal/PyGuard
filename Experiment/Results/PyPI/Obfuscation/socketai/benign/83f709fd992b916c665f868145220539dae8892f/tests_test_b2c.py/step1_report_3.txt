{
  "purpose": "Unit tests for the B2CHelper class in the b2c module, mocking API interactions with Microsoft Graph API.",
  "sources": "Mocked requests functions (mocked_requests_post, mocked_requests_get, mocked_requests_patch, mocked_requests_delete), and the TOKEN_REQUEST_DATA dictionary used for authentication.",
  "sinks": "Use of mock request functions simulating network calls; no actual untrusted input or data sinks that could lead to leaks or malicious actions.",
  "flows": "Mocked data flows from test functions through mocked request functions, simulating source-to-sink interactions without real network communication.",
  "anomalies": "No hardcoded credentials or secrets other than the benign TOKEN_REQUEST_DATA; all data is static and used for mocking. No suspicious code behaviors observed.",
  "analysis": "The code consists solely of unit tests using mocked network responses to test the B2CHelper class. No actual network calls, file I/O, or environment variable manipulations are present. The mocked responses return static, safe data without executing any dynamic code or handling untrusted input. The structure indicates standard testing practices with no signs of obfuscated or malicious code. All data flows are controlled within the test environment, and no potential attack vectors such as code injection or data exfiltration are evident.",
  "conclusion": "The code is purely for testing purposes with mocked data and does not contain any malicious behavior or security risks. It does not perform any real operations beyond simulating API responses. Therefore, it poses no supply chain threat or malware risk.",
