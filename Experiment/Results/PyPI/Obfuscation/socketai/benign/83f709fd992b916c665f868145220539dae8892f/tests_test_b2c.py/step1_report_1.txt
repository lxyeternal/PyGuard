{
  "purpose": "The code is a test suite for the B2CHelper class, designed to mock interactions with Microsoft Graph API endpoints for user management tasks.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data for token requests from the TOKEN_REQUEST_DATA dictionary, and mock functions simulate API responses based on URL patterns.",
  "sinks": "The code constructs API request URLs and returns mock responses; it does not perform any actual data processing or network communication outside the mock environment.",
  "flows": "Input data (TOKEN_REQUEST_DATA) is used to initialize B2CHelper; mocked request functions return predefined responses when called by class methods, simulating source-to-sink flows.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual or suspicious code behaviors, such as hardcoded secrets or hidden backdoors, are present. All request URLs and responses are consistent with standard API interaction patterns.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test suite with mock functions for HTTP methods, designed to validate the functionality of B2CHelper methods. Mock responses contain sample user data and tokens, but no malicious or suspicious content is present. The test data, URLs, and responses are typical for API testing, and there are no signs of malicious intent, such as data exfiltration, backdoors, or obfuscated code. The tokens and credentials used are mock data, and the code relies solely on simulated responses for testing purposes.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard test suite that uses mock responses to validate the behavior of user management methods in B2CHelper. It does not contain malicious behavior or security risks. It is safe and does not pose a supply chain threat.",
