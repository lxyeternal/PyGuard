{
  "purpose": "The code is designed to test the B2CHelper class methods related to Microsoft Graph API interactions, including token management, user CRUD operations, and batch processing, using mocked responses.",
  "sources": "The code reads configuration data for token requests, including client ID, secret, tenant ID, and scope, from the TOKEN_REQUEST_DATA dictionary. It also receives user data and parameters from function arguments.",
  "sinks": "The code does not write untrusted data to files, execute system commands, or connect to external servers. It performs API calls via requests library, but all responses are mocked. No data is leaked or sent externally in this test context.",
  "flows": "Input data such as tokens, user information, and request parameters flow into API call functions and are used to generate responses; responses are used to validate methods. There are no suspicious flows of untrusted data outside the scope of mocked tests.",
  "anomalies": "No unusual code, hardcoded secrets (beyond test data), or obfuscation is detected. All code appears to be standard test scaffolding with mock functions and data. No backdoors, hidden code, or malicious logic are present.",
  "analysis": "The code is a comprehensive test suite for the B2CHelper class, employing mock responses to simulate interactions with external APIs. It reads configuration data from a dictionary, which is typical in test setups. No suspicious or malicious behavior such as network exfiltration, data theft, or backdoors is observed. The test functions only invoke class methods and validate expected responses using mocks. All sensitive data, such as secrets, are mock values, and there are no signs of malicious payloads, code injection, or security misconfigurations.",
  "conclusion": "This code is a standard unit test suite for a helper class interacting with Microsoft Graph API, with no evidence of malicious intent or security risks. It employs mocking for safe testing. The code appears secure, with no hidden or harmful behavior.",
