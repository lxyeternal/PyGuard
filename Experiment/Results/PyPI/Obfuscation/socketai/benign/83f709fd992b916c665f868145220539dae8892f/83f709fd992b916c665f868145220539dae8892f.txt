      "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the code's security posture. Reports with obfuscation and dynamic features are appropriately scored with moderate malware suspicion (0.4), while benign code is scored as non-malicious (0). The overall security risk scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary unless further code details reveal more evidence."

      "conclusion": "The code is a legitimate user management utility with security hygiene issues like hardcoded passwords and minimal input validation. There is no evidence of malicious behavior or malware. The overall security risk is moderate due to insecure practices but not malicious intent. The malware and obfuscation scores are correctly set to 0. The risk score of approximately 0.3-0.4 reflects the insecure practices identified."

      "conclusion": "The code is a standard, well-structured unit test suite that employs mocks for safe API interaction testing. It contains no malicious code, obfuscation, or security vulnerabilities. The low malware and obfuscation scores are appropriate, and the minimal risk score reflects the controlled testing environment. Overall, the code poses no supply chain or security threat."
