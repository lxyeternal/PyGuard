  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the code's security posture. Reports with obfuscation and dynamic features are appropriately scored with moderate malware suspicion (0.4), while benign code is scored as non-malicious (0). The overall security risk scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary unless further code details reveal more evidence."
