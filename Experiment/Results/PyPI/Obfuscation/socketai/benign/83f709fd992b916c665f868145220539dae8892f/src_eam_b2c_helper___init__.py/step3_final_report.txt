  "purpose": "Analysis of open-source Python dependency code for malicious behavior, obfuscation, and security risks.",
  "sources": "Use of eval()/exec(), hardcoded secrets, obfuscated code, network communication, input/output handling, environment variables.",
  "sinks": "Potential data exfiltration points, network connections, file modifications, environment variable access, dynamic code execution.",
  "flows": "Input sources (eval(), user input, environment variables) to suspicious functions or network sinks.",
  "anomalies": "High obfuscation, dynamic execution, hardcoded credentials, misleading variable names, complex control flow, suspicious network activity.",
  "analysis": "The code exhibits obfuscation and dynamic execution patterns, with some reports indicating suspicious functions like eval()/exec() and hardcoded secrets. Benign reports lack these features. Scores are generally aligned with the suspicion level: higher malware and obfuscation scores in reports with obfuscation and dynamic code, lower in straightforward code. The confidence scores reflect the certainty of these assessments. No concrete malicious activity is confirmed, but the suspicion warrants cautious scoring.",
  "conclusion": "Most reports accurately reflect the code's security posture. Reports with obfuscation and dynamic features are appropriately scored with moderate malware suspicion (0.4), while benign code is scored as non-malicious (0). The overall security risk scores are consistent with the analysis. No adjustments are necessary unless further code details reveal more evidence.",
