  "conclusion": "The code is a benign timezone offset calculator with an obfuscated name. No malicious activity or security vulnerabilities are present. The scores assigned in the reports are appropriate; malware score remains at 0, and overall security risk is very low (~0.1). Slightly lowering obfuscation scores could be considered, but current assessments are justified."
